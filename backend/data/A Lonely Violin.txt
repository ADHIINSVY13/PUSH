Title: A Lonely Violin
Artist: Bee Gees
Oh
What it is to be lonely
Deep in the green grass
Of the valley of fear
One time long ago
I tried so hard to reach you
A song I tried to teach you
But you were never there
Deep in the sleep I'm under
There is the sound of a lonely violin
Not even now there's nothing I'd be taking
What world am I forsaking
When you were never there
Now let it all begin
I wanna hear it, now, let it all begin
Bring me the sound of a lonely violin
Oh
What it is to be lonely
Deep in the green grass
Of the valley of fear
One time long ago
I tried so hard to reach you
A song I tried to teach you
But you were never there

Now, let it all begin
I wanna hear it now let it all begin
Bring me the sound of a lonely violin
