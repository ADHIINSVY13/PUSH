Title: A Little Melancholy
Artist: Sam Smith
[Verse 1]
I resign myself to a strange sensation
Of wanting somebody that I can't have
I wish I could believe you relieve my tension
By telling me something I want to hear
But you won't
Will you?
[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
[Verse 2]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't help the feelings that I found
Your sentimental touch fills my hear with elation
Are we gonna kick this off the ground?
[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
[Reprise]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't hide the feelings that I found
And you aren't gonna help me, are you?

[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
