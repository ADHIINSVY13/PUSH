Did you see him? Are y'all together?\nIf so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest\nSay what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet\nI left a half a hundred in your commissary\nYou was my nigga when push came to shove (One what?) One love!\n\n[Refrain: Q-Tip]\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nDear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong\nOut in New York, the same shit is goin' on\nThe crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'\nHold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'\nThat nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'\nWord to mother, I heard him frontin'\nAnd he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock\nAnd now they run together — what up, son? Whatever\nSince I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease\nBut I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece\nWildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira\nBetter chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire\nLast time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers\nBut maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours\nOn the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal\nWhen we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal\nBut chill, see you on the next V.I\nI gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks\nYour brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me\nHe might beat his case, 'til he come home, I'll play it lowkey\nSo stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated, your mind dive\nI hate it when your moms cries\nIt kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a\nI even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love\n\n[Refrain: Q-Tip]\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nSometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack\nMind's in another world, thinkin', \"How can we exist through the facts?\"\nWritten in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera\nFuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er\nSo I be ghost from my projects\nI take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'\nA two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone\nTo relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home\nYou see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible\nFuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue\nOr HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten\nA future in a maximum state pen is grim\nSo I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop\nRollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em \"oo-wops\"\nHe said, \"Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof\nSo I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre deuce\"\nHe inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep\nStarted coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak\nI sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black\nWe was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks\nI took the L when he passed it, this little bastard\nKeeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit\nI had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him\n'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one\nTough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up\nCould have caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up\nMistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up\nAt the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed\nShorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul\nOnly 12, tryna tell me that he liked my style\nThen I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes\nThen froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose\nAnd told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze\nLeft some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose\nWords of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above\nKeep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love\n\n[Refrain: Q-Tip]\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\n[Outro: Nas]\nTo all my niggas locked up\nFrom Queensbridge and all over\nAnd to my man Goon, one love\nTo my man Herb, one love\nTo my man Lake Luciano, one love\nCan't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big Bo, one love\n(One love, one love, one love, one love)\nTo Oogie, yeah, one love\n(One Love)"
