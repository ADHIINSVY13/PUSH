  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings\nOf the dreams that he brings from the wide-open sea\nIn the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps\nWhile the river bank weeps to the old willow tree\nIn the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies\nFull of beer, full of cries, in a drunken town fight\nIn the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born\nOn a hot muggy morn by the dawn's early light\n[Verse 2]\nIn the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet\nThere's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails\nAnd he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon\nThat can haul up the sails, that can swallow the moon\nAnd he yells to the cook with his arms open wide\n\"Hey, bring me more fish, throw it down by my side\"\nAnd he wants so to belch but he's too full to try\nSo he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly\n[Verse 3]\nIn the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance\nPaunches bursting their pants, grinding women to porch\nThey've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked\nSplitting the night with the roar of their jokes\nAnd they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust\nTill the rancid sound of the accordion bursts\nAnd then out of the night with their pride in their pants\nAnd the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps\n\n[Verse 4]\nIn the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks\nAnd he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again\nHe'll drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam\nWho've given their bodies to a thousand other men\nYeah, they've bargained their virtue their goodness all gone\nFor a few dirty coins, well, he just can't go on\nThrows his nose to the sky, aims it up above\nAnd he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love\n[Outro]\nIn the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam"
