Kids, sing!\nWe wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nThis second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle\n'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55\nAnd everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's\nAnd bootleg tapes just to get they cake up\nWe put shit on layaway, then come back\nWe claim other people kids on our income tax\nWe take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid\nAnd we don't care what people say\nMama say she wanna move South\nScratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house\n'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house\nCouldn't get a job\nSo since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work\nThe drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight\nSo niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight\nBut we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake\nAnd we don't care what people say, my niggas—\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, \nKanye West\n]\nDrug dealin' just to get by (\nYeah\n)\nStack your money 'til it get sky high\nKids, sing! Kids, sing!\nWe wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five\nJoke's on you, we still alive (\nAlive\n)\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say (\nUh-huh, yeah\n)\n\"We don't care what people say\" (\nYeah, yeah, ugh\n)\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nYou know the kids gon' act a fool\nWhen you stop the programs for after school\nAnd they DCFS,\n \nsome of 'em dyslexic\nThey favorite 50 Cent song \"12 Questions\"\nWe scream: \"Rocks, blows, weed, park,\" see, now we smart\nWe ain't retards the way teachers thought\nHold up, hold fast, we make more cash\nNow, tell my mama I belong in that slow class\nIt's bad enough we on welfare\nYou tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair\nI'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here\nYou tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here\nLook what was handed us, fathers abandoned us\nWhen we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance\nSometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us\nBut we don't care what people say, my niggas—\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, \nKanye West\n]\nDrug dealin' just to get by\nStack your money 'til it get sky high\nKids, sing! Kids, sing!\nWe wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n[Produced by Kanye West]"
