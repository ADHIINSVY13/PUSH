  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSome punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey\nIn cold blood, in the \nlobby of a downtown motel\nKilled him in anger, a force he couldn't handle\nHelped pull the trigger that cut short his life\nAnd there's not many knew him the way that we did\nSure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most \nhungry kids?\n[Chorus]\nNow it's all over, Danny Bailey\nAnd the \nharvest\n is in\nDillinger's dead\n, oh\nI guess the cops won again\nNow it's all over, Danny Bailey\nAnd the harvest is in\n[Verse 2]\nWe're running short of heroes back up here in the hills\nWithout Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills\nSo mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him\nBorn and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him\nAnd he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by\nA running gun youngster in a sad restless age\n[Chorus]\nNow it's all over, Danny Bailey\nAnd the harvest is in\nDillinger's dead\nI guess the cops won again\nNow it's all over, Danny Bailey\nAnd the harvest is in"
