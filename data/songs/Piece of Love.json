(Oh, yeah)\nWhat's going on, baby?\nWhat's on your mind? (Whoa, whoa)\nDid you leave a piece of love behind?\n\n[Bridge: Lionel Richie & \nMarva King\n]\nIt's hard to say \n(It's hard to say)\n, oh, we've made mistakes\nWhen it's not over, it's best to put pride away\nTwo eyes should not cry the tears of regret\n'Cause two lips won't let go of an age old lover's lie \n(Lie)\nOh, baby, oh\n[Chorus: Lionel Richie]\nWhat's wrong, baby?\nWhat's on your mind?\nDid you leave a piece of love behind?\nWhat's going on, baby?\nWhat is on your mind? (Whoa, whoa)\nDid you leave a piece of love behind?\n[Outro: Lionel Richie]\nI'd do anything for you, I'll give you all my heart\nWhoa, did you leave a piece of love behind?\nOh, did you leave your love behind?"
