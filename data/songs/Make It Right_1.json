Who's it gonna be?\nGonna be another\n\n[Chorus]\nHop on the train to nowhere, baby\nDon't you wanna hitch a ride?\nLights go out and your head starts spinnin'\nSomeone got you hypnotized\nDown on the chain, your bad tuxedo\nBrother, can you spare a dime?\nCount what's left when it's all gone wrong\nHow you gonna make it right?\n[Post-Chorus]\nHow you gonna make it right?\nGonna make it right\nHow you gonna make it right?\nMake it right\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Chorus]\nHop on the train to nowhere, baby\nDon't you wanna hitch a ride?\nLights go out and your head starts spinnin'\nSomeone got you hypnotized\nDown on the chain, your bad tuxedo\nBrother, can you spare a dime?\nCount what's left when it's all gone wrong\nHow you gonna make it right?\n\n[Outro]\nHow you gonna make it right?\nHow you gonna make it right?\nGonna make it right\nGonna make it right!\nGonna make it right!"
