  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEvery night and every day\nMy heart feels the pain\nI wake up to the thought of you\nAnd I call your name\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNo one ever made me feel the way you do\nNothing in this world I wouldn't do for you\nBut now I've got to let go\n[Chorus]\nWe don't stand a chance\nIn this wild romance, my tender heart\nMaybe it's wiser to walk away and love again\nWith my tender heart\nWe don't stand a chance\nIn this wild romance, whoa, it hurts so bad\nKnowing that I'm not the one you want\nI can't hold on to my tender heart\n[Verse 2]\nI never thought I'd be the one\nWho would play the fool\nBut I know love can feel so good\nAnd can be so cruel\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's clear to me the writing is on the wall\nIt's clear to me that you don't really love me at all\nAnd I can't go on this way\n[Chorus]\nWe don't stand a chance\nIn this wild romance, my tender heart\nMaybe it's wiser to walk away and love again\nWith my tender heart\nWe don't stand a chance\nIn this wild romance, whoa, it hurts so bad\nKnowing that I'm not the one you want\nI can't hold on to my tender heart\n[Bridge]\nI'm standing at the door\nDon't need this hurt no more\nI'm crying out in vain\n'Cause you don't feel my pain, oh\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMaybe it was always gonna be this way\nMaybe I'll look back and understand some day\nBut now I've got to say\n\n[Chorus]\nWe don't stand a chance\nIn this wild romance, my tender heart\nMaybe it's wiser to walk away and love again\nWith my tender heart\nWe don't stand a chance\nIn this wild romance, oh, it hurts so bad\nKnowing that I'm not the one you want\nI can't hold on to my tender heart\n[Outro]\nMy tender heart"
