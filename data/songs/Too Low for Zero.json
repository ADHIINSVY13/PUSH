  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSix o'clock alarm\nI get the wake up call\nLet that sucker jingle-jangle\nRing right off the wall\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm too tired to work\nTied one on with a friend last night\nAnd wound up losing my shirt\n[Chorus]\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm on a losing streak\nI got myself in a bad patch lately\nI can't seem to get much sleep\nI'm too low for zero\nI wind up counting sheep\nNothing seems to make much sense\nIt's all just Greek to me\nYou know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero\nYou know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero\n[Verse 2]\nCutting out cups of coffee\nSwitching off the late night news\nPutting the cat out two hours early\nIt isn't any use\nI'm too low for zero\nInsomnia attacks\nWatching flies with my eyes till sunrise\nIt's daylight when I hit the sack\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm on a losing streak\nI got myself in a bad patch lately\nI can't seem to get much sleep\nI'm too low for zero\nI wind up counting sheep\nNothing seems to make much sense\nIt's all just Greek to me\nYou know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero\nYou know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero\n[Chorus]\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm on a losing streak\nI got myself in a bad patch lately\nI can't seem to get much sleep\nI'm too low for zero\nI wind up counting sheep\nNothing seems to make much sense\nIt's all just Greek to me\nYou know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero\nYou know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero\n[Outro]\nFor zero, for zero, for zero\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm too low for zero\nI'm too low for zero"
