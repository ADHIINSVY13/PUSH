  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's always a joker in the pack\nThere's always a lonely clown\nThe poor laughing fool falls on his back\nAnd everyone laughs when he's down\nThere's always a funny man in the game\nBut he's only funny by mistake\nAnd everyone laughs at him just the same\nThey don't see his lonely heart break\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey don't care as long as there is a jester, just a fool\nAs foolish as he can be\nThere's always a joker, that's the rule\nBut fate deals the hand that I see\n[Chorus]\nThe joker is me\n, the joker is me\nThe joker is me, the joker is me\nThe joker is me\n[Verse 2]\nDrink the poison 'cause there's always a loser in the game\nThe court loves to watch them cry\nThe royals shout, \"This queen needs to sing\"\nTo ruffle the scene of the crime\nThe king wears a funny suit, he's a clown\nThe crowd rumbles with their roars\nAnd everyone watches as he declines\nThe queen pierces him with a sword\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't care as long as there is a wild man in the deck\nAs long as I see his frown\nThen I won't be lonely, that's a fact\nI stand here and wait for his sound, ha, ha, ha\n[Chorus]\nThe joker is me, the joker is me\nThe joker is me, the joker is me\nThe joker is me\n[Outro]\nThe joker is me\nThe joker is me"
