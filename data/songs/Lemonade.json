Yes\nA job? \nYes\nA job?\n Ah, man\nLet's kick it old school with\n \na lemonade stand\nCooler full of gold,\n and the cups \nto the curb\nLet's make a sign that says \"Ten cents,\" \nword\nYo, someone's operatin' on our turf without permission\nUh-oh, looks like we got competition\n[Chorus: Madison Hu, \nOlivia Rodrigo\n & \nBoth\n]\nThey slingin' \nlemonade\n (\nLemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (\nLemon, lemonade\n)\n[Verse 2: Madison Hu & \nOlivia Rodrigo\n]\nWe can't have some other chicas tryna steal our cheese\nThese girls are half our age\n, it's about to be a breeze\nWait, do you see what I see? Woah, that kinda rocks\nLooks almost like a food truck and all we got's this box\nA little healthy competition's just fine with me\nThose are fresh organic lemons, where'd they get that lemon tree?\nPfft, concentrated mix is just as nice\nUh, this is warm, I think we need some ice\n\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, \nMadison Hu\n & \nBoth\n]\nTo sell this \nlemonade\n (Lemonade; \nlemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (Lemon, lemonade; \nlemon, lemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (Lemonade; \nlemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (Lemon, lemonade; \nlemon, lemonade\n)\n[Verse 3: Olivia Rodrigo & \nMadison Hu\n]\nThey got an ice sculpture and a line of people at their stand\nIt's all good, we cool, I got two foldin' fans\nThey serve their lemonade in glasses with rainbows and unicorns\nThey're swipin' credit cards, plus they got embroidered uniforms\nPlease, we keep it real, we got nothin' to envy\nI just downloaded their app, and it's really user-friendly\nPssh, the game done changed\nHow can we compete?\nThat's a bunch of hype, our lemonade is just as sweet\nLet's see, what's all the fuss about?\nWow, this is delicious\nLine's around the block, \nyo, their business sense is vicious\nWe need to close-up shop, Frankie, let's not pretend\nBut we'll get embroidered uniforms if we work for them\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo, \nMadison Hu\n & \nBoth\n]\nSlingin' \nlemonade\n (Lemonade; \nlemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (Lemon, lemonade; \nlemon, lemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (Lemonade; \nlemonade\n)\nLemonade\n (Lemon, lemon, lemonade)"
