  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHold my hand\nWhile you cut me down\nIt'd only just begun\nBut now it's over now\nAnd you're in the heat of moments\nWith your heart playing up cold\nI'm between the middle\nWatching hastiness unfold\nOn my eyes\nYou were smiling in the spotlight\nDancing with the night\nThe night fell off your mind\n[Chorus]\nI'm tired of trying\nYour teasing ain't enough\nFed up of biding your time\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nAnd for what, and for what, and for what\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nBoy, I'm tired\n[Verse 2]\nWhere'd you go\nWhen you stay behind\nI looked up and inside down\nAnd outside only to find\nA double taking, punching hard\nAnd laughing at my smile\nI get closer\nYou obviously prefer her\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm tired of trying\nYour teasing ain't enough\nFed up of biding your time\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nAnd for what, and for what, and for what\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nBoy, I'm tired of trying\nYour teasing ain't enough\nFed up of biding your time\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nAnd for what, and for what, and for what\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nHey, I'm tired\n[Bridge]\nI should have known\n[Verse 3]\nNever mind\nSaid your open arms\nI couldn't help believe\nIt tricked me back into them\n[Chorus]\nEven though I'm tired of trying\nYour teasing ain't enough\nFed up of biding your time\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nAnd for what, and for what, and for what\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nBoy, I'm tired of trying\nYour teasing ain't enough\nFed up of biding your time\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nAnd for what, and for what, and for what\nWhen I don't get nothing back\nBoy, I'm tired"
