I don't know\nAnd who am I now? Your body shows how\nThe past just has no meaning\n[Chorus: John Legend & \nBrittany Howard\n]\nDon't stop\n, I need it\nRelease me, it's too hard for me to hold\nMy heart\n bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone\nOh Lord\n, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby\nNothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love\nNever gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nOh yeah, yeah\n[Chorus: John Legend & \nBrittany Howard\n]\nOh, \ndon't stop\n, I need it\nRelease me, it's too hard for me to hold\nMy heart\n bleeding, your touch, it thrills me to the bone\nOh Lord\n, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby\nNothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love\nNever gon' get enough, nothing can stop it"
