  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's a river running sweat right through our land, through our land\nDriven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand, in his hand\nAnd I've taken just as much as I can stand, I can stand\nOh, we've got to free our brothers from their shackles, yeah, if we can, if we can\n[Verse 2]\nMost nights I have to watch my woman cry, oh, she cries\nEvery day I watch the colonel smile, oh, he smiles\nHis painted ladies riding in from town, in from town\nOh, I swear one day I'm gonna burn the whorehouse to the ground, to the ground\n[Chorus]\nSlave, slave\nTo fight the violence we must be brave\nHold on strong to the love God gave\nSlave\n[Verse 3]\nThere's a rumor of a war that's yet to come, yet to come\nThat may free our families, free our families and our sons, and our sons\nIt may lay green lands to barren waste, all to waste, all to waste\nOh, the price of release is a bitter blow to face, oh, to face\n[Chorus]\nSlave, slave\nTo fight the violence we must be brave\nHold on strong to the love God gave\nSlave\n\n[Slide Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nSlave, oh, slave\nTo fight the violence we must be brave\nHold on strong to the love God gave\nSlave, slave\nTo fight the violence we must be brave\nHold on strong to the love God gave\nSlave"
