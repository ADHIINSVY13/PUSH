  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSolemn faced, the village settles down\nUndetected by the stars\nAnd the hangman plays the mandolin, before he goes to sleep\nAnd the last thing on his mind\nIs the Wild-Eyed Boy, imprisoned\n'Neath the covered wooden shaft\nFolds the rope into its bag\nBlows his pipe of smolders, blankets smoke into the room\nAnd the day will end for some\nAs the night begins for one\n[Verse 2]\nStaring, through the message in his eyes, lies a solitary son\nFrom the mountain called Freecloud\nWhere the eagle dare not fly\nAnd the patience in his sigh\nGives no indication, for the townsmen to decide\nSo the village dreadful yawns\nPronouncing gross diversion, as the label for the dog\n\"Oh! It's the madness in his eyes.\"\nAs he breaks the night to cry:\n[Bridge]\n\"It's really me!\"\n\"Really you and really me!\"\n\"It's so hard for us to really be!\"\n\"Really you and really me!\"\n\"You'll lose me, though I'm always really free!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the mountain moved its eyes\nTo the world of Realize\nWhere the snow had saved a place\nFor the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud\nAnd the village dreadful cried\nAs the rope began to rise\nFor the smile stayed on the face\nOf the Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud\n[Verse 3]\nAnd the women once proud clutched the heart of the crowd\nAs the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand\nAnd the Magic in the stare of the Wild-Eyed Boy said\n\"Stop, Freecloud\nThey won't think to cut me down!\"\nOh!\n[Verse 4]\nBut the cottages fell, like a playing card hell\nAnd the tears on the face of the Wise Boy\nCame trembling down to the rumbling ground\nAnd the missionary mystic of peace-love\nStumbled back to cry among the clouds\nKicking back the pebbles\nFrom the Freecloud mountain track"
