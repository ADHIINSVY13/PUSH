You're gorgeous\n[Verse 2]\nYou should take it as a compliment\nThat I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)\nAnd you should think about the consequence\nOf you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)\nIf you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her\nBut if you're single, that's honestly worse\n'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOcean blue eyes lookin' in mine\nI feel like I might sink and drown and die\n[Chorus]\nYou're so gorgeous\nI can't say anything to your face (To your face)\n'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; \nGorgeous\n)\nAnd I'm so furious\nAt you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)\nBut what can I say? You're gorgeous\n[Bridge]\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\nYou are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\nGuess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Ugh) alone\nUnless you wanna come along (Oh)\n[Chorus]\nYou're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)\nI can't say anything to your face (To your face)\n'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; \nGorgeous\n)\nAnd I'm so furious (I'm so furious)\nAt you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)\nBut what can I say? (I say) You're gorgeous\n\n[Outro]\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\nYou are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\nYou're gorgeous\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Turns back to sad)\nThere's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (What I can't have)\nYou are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\nYou're gorgeous"
