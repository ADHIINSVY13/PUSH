Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style\nThey said I'm way too soft and I sound like AZ and Nas\nOut came the claws and the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\" I pondered\nI just wanna play my part\nShould I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\n and have people rub it in your face\nBefore you get made pissed off\nAnd keep plugging, it's your only outlet,\n \nand your only outfit\nSo you know they gonna talk about it\n, \nbetter find a way to counter it quick\nAnd make it—, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a ka-billion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story\nBet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia & \nEminem\n]\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (\nMy dreams\n)\nI didn't wanna go another round (\nYeah\n)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (\nAgh\n)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (\nYeah\n)\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me 'round\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nFeels like a close, it's comin' to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I—, thing I know\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know what it was like, I was there once\nSingle parents, hate your appearance\nDid you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song\nLearned who to aim it on, that I made a spark\nStarted to spit harder shit, learned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit\nBut the crazy part was soon as I stopped sayin' I gave a fuck\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park? (Oh)\nAnd the window is closin', and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows, and I'm frozen\n'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo, to the break of dawn, here I go recyclin' the same old song\nBut I'd rather make Not Afraid two\nThan make another motherfuckin' We Made You, ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on\n \nand gave you the supplies and the tools\nTo hopefully use that'll make you strong\n \nenough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust havin' to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania\nSo when they empty that stadium\nLeast I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just gettin' accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar\nYou are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say, don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk, take it with a grain of salt\nAnd eat their fuckin' faces off\nThe legend of the angry blond lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was a—\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia & \nEminem\n]\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (\nMy dreams\n)\nI didn't wanna go another round (\nYeah\n)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (\nAgh\n)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (\nYeah\n)\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me 'round\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear"
