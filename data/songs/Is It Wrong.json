  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI guess it’s symptomatic of a slight infatuation\nStalkin' you has sorta become like my occupation\nUsed to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions\nMet my local rock star now I’m havin' visions\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI fell for you, you like me too\nLet’s get it on, check one, two\nI fell for you, you want me too\nLet’s get it on\n[Chorus]\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nI’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nYou’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on\nYou got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care\nYou got me in the back of your car like a star\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nIf it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right\n[Verse 2]\nI get so systematic in this kind of situation\nI need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination\nUsed to be so simple, never wantin’, never wishin’\nNow I’m hooked on fame and I’m a girl on a mission\n\n[Pre-Chorus - Variation]\nI fall for you, it’s all for you\nLet’s get it on, check one, two\nI fall for you, it’s all for you\nLet’s get it on\n[Chorus]\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nI’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nYou’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on\nYou got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care\nYou got me in the back of your car like a star\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nIf it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right\n[Bridge]\nA funny little thing about love is that you’re blind all the time\nAnd even when you think you had enough\nYou’re wanting more, it isn’t right but\nYou can’t stop\n[Chorus - Variation]\nYou got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care\nYou got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r\nYou got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care\nYou got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r\nIs it wrong?\nIs it wrong?\nIf it’s wrong I don’t wanna be right"
