It was later played live in a protest against the Westboro Baptist Church.\nKeep it clean\nMy mama said keep It clean\nDriving all night\nGot a hankering for something\nThink I'm in the mood for some hot-man muffins\nMmmm, Sounds so fine, yes indeed\nKeep It Clean\nMy Daddy said keep it clean\nAin't looking for a fight\nAin't looking for trouble\nHowdy Mr. Right have you met Mister Bubble\nHey, put ‘er there, ain't she sweet\nRubbin' and a lovin' and a scrubbin' and a truckin'\nMaybe if we're lucky just a little bear huggin'\nKnow what I mean, Keep it clean"
