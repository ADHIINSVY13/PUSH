(Double entendre)\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)\nI don't wanna be alone in the darkness\nI don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo\nI can hear the music continue to crescendo\nI can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window\nThat's when you know you're schizo\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel\nThe music is so loud\nBut it's almost as though I don't hear no sound\nI should get ready for the show now\nWait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nBut it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact\nThen something told me relax\nAnd just hope for the show to be packed\nDon't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max\n'Cause that'd be totally wack\nYou can't murder a show nobody's at\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nBut what if nobody shows? Panic mode\n'\nBout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second\n'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance\nPlan is a go to wreck shit,\n \ncameras in all directions\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nThe press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks\nCommando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers\nI'm armed to the teeth\n, \nanother Valium, fall off the bed\nHit the ground and crawl to the dresser\nAlcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope\n(\nHello darkness, my old friend\n)\nI'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds\nWith them benzodiazepines gone\nNow it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor\nFuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)\nI don't wanna be alone in the darkness\nI don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n[Verse 3]\nPeople start to show up, time to start the show up\nIt's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up\nAnd I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded\nFor rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers\nScopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere\nAs I slide the clip in from inside the hotel\nLeanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze\nFinger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner\nWith no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit\nSo my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier\nGot 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences\nSome of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nCops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance\nGuess show time is over\nNo suicide note, just a note for target distance\nBut if you'd like to know the reason why I did this\nYou'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea\nI am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness\nJust tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked\n'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't wanna be alone in the darkness\nI don't wanna be alone in the darkness\nI don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\n[Outro]\nYeah, we do have some breaking news from the Associated Press right now\nJust gonna bring that up because we are hearing—\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nWe have told you that the shooter is dead\nAnd we have just learned that police are saying that the Las Vegas shooter killed himself\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nThat is the bartender there at Mandalay Bay and I believe we're going to hear more from her\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nYeah, we just wanted to share that with you\nYou can see behind me here, this is what he looks like\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nNow we did just tell you that police just earlier...\nMetro was telling us that he killed himself inside the hotel room\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nGood morning, as we come to you on the air\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nWe bring you breaking news, a school shooting (Crushing news)\nAnother school shooting (Eleven people dead)\nReports of a number of fatalities, and this time it is in Santa Fe, Texas\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nThat is just outside Galveston (That no one saw coming)\nA mass shooting at a Southern Californian school (A suspect has been...)\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nWe are following breaking news this morning\nAnother deadly school shooting\nThis one in Santa Fe, Texas, that's just outside Houston\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nTwenty-six killed and twenty others wounded (Houston affiliate is reporting)\nAt least nine people have been killed (Somber words, making it the deadliest shooting in Texas history)\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nFive people dead\nThe attacker opening fire outside the church during a morning worship session\nHe unloaded the chaotic and terror, making his way inside (Five people killed in a workplace shooting, dozens of officers)\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nThis, a deadly shooting at a food festival in Northern California\n(\nHello, darkness, my old friend\n)\nThree people so far dead\nBreaking news (Fifteen wounded)\nA deadly shooting at a newspaper office in Annapolis (A gunman opened fire)\n(\nI've come to talk with you again\n)\nNewly-released surveillance video shows the moments leading up to a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio\nAuthorities say the shooter..."
