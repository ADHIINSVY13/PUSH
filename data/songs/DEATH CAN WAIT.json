  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy life looks like I picked it out of a video game\nHad to put the bulletproof windows on the all-black Escalade\nShowed the world how to get paid\nWithout shackles and chains society puts on your brain\nI'm tryna maintain without goin' insane\nStay in my lane without goin' astray\nFace my fate, melt my face knowin' death can't wait\nBorn in this world and end up being saved\nMy sins dictate my way of life\nFixatin' on what's not right\nSkin bakin' and that's the light\nI've been waitin' for the reaper to arrive tonight\n[Verse 2]\nEasy come, easy go, not everything was meant for me\nI don't know if where I'm goin' is leadin' me to my dеstiny\nI'm makin' moves, but I can't see ahead, I'm hopin' I don't end up dеad\nWith a fat bullet inside of my head, I know my enemies ready\nThe way I've been stackin' this bread got these fuckboys seein' red\nHeavy and green, why I stay with a stick, twelve-gauge shotgun under my bed\nPray my foes get filled up with lead, dumped in a hole to never be found\nRoaches and maggots crawlin' on the ground as I rise from the fire to leave 'em to drown"
