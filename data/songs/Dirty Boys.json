  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSomething like tobacco road\nLiving on a lonely road\nI will pull you out of there\nWe will go to Finchley fair\n[Verse 2]\nI will buy you feather hat\nI will steal a cricket bat\nSmash some windows, make a noise\nWe will run with dirty boys\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun goes down\nWhen the sun goes down\n \nand the die is cast\nWhen the die is cast and you have no choice\nWe will run with dirty boys\n[Verse 3]\nWe all gone mad\nWe all want you\nVinny and the boys, we all go through\nYou got to learn to hold your tongue\nThis ain't the moon this is burnin' sun\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun goes down\nWhen the sun goes down and the die is cast\nWhen the die is cast and you have no choice\nWe will run with dirty boys"
