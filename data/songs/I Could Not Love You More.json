  "lyrics": "Now that we're alone\nNo more hide and seek\nYou are the highest dream to me\nAnd as you softly sleep\nThen I can tell you what it means\nLocked in my arms like lovers lie\nI will not let you slip away\nI sthis the summer of them all\nIs this my night of nights\nThat you came to stay\nHere you are, owner of my heart\nJust the way that love should be\nAnd there is something I must say to you\nIf you promise to believe\nThat it's you I'm living for\nAnd, I could not love you more\nSeasons may come and seasons go\nBut these are the truest words I know\nFace to face, eye to eye\nThis is the summer of our lives\nOne love that cannot die\nHere you are, owner of my soul\nNever let you say goodbye\nAnd there is something I must say to you\nWe leave the world outside\nAnd you have come to me at last, we start\nOpen up your heart\nLet my deepest love inside\nI'm only doing what I have to do\nIf you promise to believe\nThat it's you I'm living for\nAnd, I could not love you (more)"
