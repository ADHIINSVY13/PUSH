  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the corner of the morning in the past\nI would sit and blame the master first and last\nAll the roads were straight and narrow\nAnd the prayers were small and yellow\nAnd the rumour spread that I was aging fast\nThen I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree\nAnd I looked and frowned and the monster was me\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I said hello and I said hello\nAnd I asked \n\"Why not?\"\n and I replied \n\"I don't know\"\nSo we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be\nWell he laughed insane and quipped Khalil Gibran\nAnd I cried for all the others until the day was nearly through\nFor I realized that God's a young man too\n[Verse 3]\nSo I said \"So long\" and I waved bye-bye\nAnd I smashed my soul and traded my mind\nGot laid by a young bordello\nWho was vaguely half asleep\nFor which my reputation swept back home in drag\nAnd the morals of this magic spell\nNegotiate my hide\nWhen God did take my logic for a ride\n(Riding along)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 4]\nHe swallowed his pride and puckered his lips\nAnd showed me the leather belt round his hips\nMy knees were shaking, my cheeks aflame\nHe said, you'll never go down to the Gods again\n(Turn around, go back!)\nHe struck the ground, a cavern appeared\nAnd I smelt the burning pit of fear\nWe crashed a thousand yards below\nI said, do it again, do it again\n(Turn around, go back!)\nHis nebulous body swayed above\nHis tongue swollen with devil's love\nThe snake and I, a venom high\nI said, do it again, do it again\n(Turn around, go back!)\nBreathe, breathe, breathe deeply\nAnd I was seething, breathing deeply\nSpitting sentry, horned and tailed\nWaiting for you\n[Instrumental Outro]"
