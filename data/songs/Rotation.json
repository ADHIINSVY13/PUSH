(Yuh)\nBaby, do you mind if I dance on you with no pants on you?\nWith that tight skirt\nSlow it down, workin', that's light work\nIf I don’t get your number that might hurt\nAss cheeks under that white shirt, uh\nSpend the night, night then the day, day on the dick\nTwerk, twerk then I nae-nae on the dick\nRotate, spin it like a Beyblade on the dick\nCuckoo-for-the-Cocoa-Puffs cray on the dick\nAnd I'm sittin' on your lap with your face on the hips\nChampagne on my brain, you can take a little sip\nThen it’s off to the bartender\nBoy, you know you got my word\nTrust me, when I drop that ass, you gon’ have to hold my purse\nBaby, can I calm 'dem nerves?\nI don’t care, I saw you first\nYou ain't finna dance up all upon them girls\nThey ain't got curves, not like hers\nDance for the club one time, no words\nMake it rotate when the record turn\nWrist on cold with a ass on brrr\nDance on a nigga like the end of the world, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nWaistline, don’t you let it go\nWatch me move it\nSay you like up and down upon you like\nPut it in rotation\nGrindin' on you like this\nIf I keep grindin' on you like this, I might just bring you back to my crib, yeah\n[Refrain]\nGrindin' on you like this (Like this)\nGrindin' on you like this\nIf I keep grindin' on you like this, I might just bring you back to my crib, aye\nGrindin' on you like this (Like this)\nGrindin' on you like this\nIf I keep grindin' on you like this, I might just bring you back to my crib, aye\n[Verse 2]\nBabe, you want me?\n'Cause you can get this lap dance here, for free\nSwingin' on ya, all in my head\nJust bounce it all the day, okay\nSweat drippin down my body, god\nGirls comin' out like Mardi Gras\nHurts when you grab them naughty parts\nShoulda brought with me some gnarly force\n'Cause I’m all in my heels, you all in your feels\nThe party feel dead, we probably gon’ bail\nWe Uber wrong way 'cause you ain’t got wheels\nWe both just pop pills and you ain't got plans\nIf you ain't got hoes, then I got no mans\nSo here's to find out, lets skip the whole dance\nWe ain’t gotta rush this sacred time\nLike a hourglass, grab that waistline\n\n[Chorus]\nWaistline, don’t you let it go\nWatch me move it\nSay you like up and down upon you like\nPut it in rotation\nGrindin' on you like this\nIf I keep grindin' on you like this, I might just bring you back to my crib, yeah\nGrindin' on you like this (Like this)\nGrindin' on you like this\nIf I keep grindin' on you like this I might just bring you back to my crib, aye\nGrindin' on you like this (Like this)\nGrindin' on you like this\nIf I keep grindin' on you like this I might just bring you back to my crib, aye"
