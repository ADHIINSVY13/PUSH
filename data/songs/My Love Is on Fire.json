  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLook at how they stop and stare\nAs if they've never seen a heart in love\nAnd though i see them i don't care\nCause i'm too busy thinking bout our love\nThinking about that each and every morning\nI wake up to that love glow in your eyes\nAnd though it seems i'm hooked on this fixation\nI will not stop my daydreaming\nUntil my nights are true with you\n[Chorus]\nOoh baby, my love is on fire\nOoh baby, my heart is on the wild\nOoh baby, i'm burning with desire\nI want to feel your love\nI need to feel your love mixed with mine\n[Verse 2]\nListen at me call your name\nAs if you're witness to my every word\nAnd though it seems sometimes insane\nSomething within me tells me they'll be heard\nSo i wait so patiently the moment\nWhen my love fantasies will come to life\nAnd all i need from you is confirmation\nThen i'll be living truth, those moments\nThat i long with you\n\n[Chorus][x3]\n[Bridge]\nOn flute, hubert laws\nAnd all i need from you is confirmation\nThen i'll be living truth, those moments\nThat i long with you\n[Chorus][x3]"
