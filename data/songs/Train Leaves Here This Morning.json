  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI lost ten points just for being in the right place\nAt exactly the wrong time\nI looked right at the facts there, but I may as well\nHave been completely blind\n[Chorus 1]\nSo if you see me walking all alone\nDon't look back, I'm just on my way back home\nAnd there's a train, leaves here this morning\nAnd I don't know what I might be on\n[Verse 2]\nShe signed me to a contract\nBaby said it would all be so life long\nI looked around then for a reason\nWhen there wasn't something more to blame it on\n[Chorus 2]\nBut if time makes a difference while we're gone\nTell me now and I won't be hanging on\nAnd there's a train, leaves here this morning\nAnd I don't know what I might be on\n[Verse 3]\n\"1320 North Columbus\" was the address\nThat I wrote down on my sleeve\nI don't know just what she wanted\nIt might have been that it was getting time to leave\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd I watched as the smoker passed it on\nAnd I laughed when the joker said, \"Lead on\"\n'Cause there's a train, leaves here this morning\nAnd I don't know what I might be on\n[Outro]\nThere's a train, leaves here this morning\nAnd I don't know what I might be on"
