  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nJust when things are getting complicated\nIn the eye of the storm\nShe flicks a red-hot revelation\nOff the tip of her tongue\nIt does a dozen somersaults\nAnd leaves you supercharged\nMakes me wanna blow the candles out\nJust to see if you glow in the dark\n[Chorus]\nShalalala\nShalalala\nShalalala\nShalalala\n[Verse 2]\nHome sweet home, home sweet home\nHome sweet booby-trap\nI took the batteries out my mysticism\nAnd put 'em in my thinking cap\nShe's got a telescopic hallelujah\nHanging up on her wall\nFor when it gets too complicated\nIn the eye of the storm\n\n[Chorus]\nShalalala\nShalalala\nShalalala\nShalalala\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n[Bridge]\nAnd in a hellcat spangled cavern\nWhen your judgement's on the run\nAnd you're acting like a stranger\n'Cause you thought it looked like fun\nAnd did you ever get the feeling\nThat these are things she's said before?\nHer steady hands may well have done\nThe devil's pedicure\nWhat you waiting for?\nSing another fucking\n[Chorus]\nShalalala\nShalalala\nShalalala\nShalalala"
