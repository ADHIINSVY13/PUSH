  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nStill waters run deep\nJust remember when we lie to each other\nNo one wins, and losers weep\nReflection will show this connection\nWe can lean on each other\nThis is all we need to know\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I admit I've been a fool sometimes\nI believe I may be losing you\nIt's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed\nUnder your spell and over my head\nYou took me in your arms, and you told me\nWe don't need to worry\nBut you, you never say your sorry\nKeep this love alive for us, it's all I feel\nHow can we survive if we change what is real\n[Chorus]\nStill waters run deep\nJust remember when we lie to each other\nNo one wins, and losers weep\nReflection will show this connection\nWe can lean on each other\nThis is all we need to know\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see the angel and the devil in your heart\nI confess, either one is my addiction\nAnd where you're leading me\nI don't have the will to fight\nOut of the darkness and into the light\nBut living in your arms, I can take it\nPlease don't make me shiver\nI know together we deliver\nLet the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill\nWho can justify the truth, God, I love you still\n[Chorus]\nStill waters run deep\nJust remember when we lie to each other\nNo one wins, and losers weep\nDeception will show\nIt's a struggle when you're starved for affection\nThis is all we need to know\n[Verse 3]\nDon't let him get too close to you\nYou've got a stranger on your mind\nThe dream is free\nI know I'm only human if I cry\nOr maybe we should kiss and say goodbye\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\nStill waters run deep\nJust remember when we lie to each other\nNo one wins, and losers weep\nDeception will show\nIt's a struggle when you're starved for affection\nThis is all we need to know"
