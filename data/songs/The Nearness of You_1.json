  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's not the pale moon that excites me\nThat thrills and delights me, oh no\nIt's just the nearness of you\n[Verse 2]\nIt isn't your sweet conversation\nThat brings this sensation, oh no\nIt's just the nearness of you\n[Verse 3]\nWhen you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me\nAll my wildest dreams come true\n[Verse 4]\nI need no soft lights to enchant me\nIf you'll only grant me the right\nTo hold you ever so tight\nAnd to feel in the night the nearness of you"
