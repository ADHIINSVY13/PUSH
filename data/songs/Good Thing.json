  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI had a dream I was mugged outside your house\nI had a dream in a panic you came running out\nFor a moment, you were sure I'd die on you\nFor a moment, I believed you loved me, too\nBut life is never like this, and you were never strong\n[Chorus]\nToo much of a good thing won't be good for long\nAlthough you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong\nToo much of a good thing won't be good anymore\nWatch where I tread before I fall\n[Verse 2]\nWe talk, maybe, twenty times a day\nAnd still, I never say what I want to say\nI thought I wouldn't need to\nI guess I read you wrong\n[Chorus]\nToo much of a good thing won't be good for long\nAlthough you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong\nToo much of a good thing won't be good anymore\nWatch where I tread before I fall\n[Bridge]\nYou refuse to see this, donâ€™t see it anymore\nI have made a decision not to answer your calls\n'Cause I put everything out there and I got nothing at all\n\n[Outro]\nToo much of a good thing isn't good and you know\nI watch where I walk \nbefore I fall\nBefore I fall"
