(I'm into you)\n[Chorus]\nSo if it's real\nThen, darlin', let me know\nI wouldn't mind\nIf you steal the show\n[Verse 2]\nYou and I, we go together\nYou're the sky, I'll be the weather\nA pretty thing, the sun and rain, who knew?\nOh, yeah\nSummer night, perfect occasion\nWhere am I? You know I'll be waitin' for you\nOh, for you\n[Chorus]\nSo if it's real\nThen, darlin', let me know\nI wouldn't mind\nIf you steal the show\nSo if it's real\nThen, darlin', let me know\nI wouldn't mind\nIf you steal the show\n\n[Bridge]\nYou shine, you shine\nLike forever lasts forever\nYou shine, you shine\nAnd steal the show\n[Chorus]\nSo if it's real\nThen, darlin', let me know\nI wouldn't mind\nIf you steal the show\n(Started out on a one-way train)\n(Always knew where I was gonna go next)\nSo if it's real (Didn't know until I saw your face)\nThen, darlin', let me know (I was missin' out on every moment)\n(You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two)\n(Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?)\nI wouldn't mind\nIf you steal the show"
