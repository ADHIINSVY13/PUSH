  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well\nI wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself\nThere's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for\nBut it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door\nWhich is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more\nThan anyone before (Anyone before)\nToo bad they're usually deranged\n[Verse 2]\nLast week, I realized I crave pity\nWhen I retell a story, I make everything sound worse\nCan't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing\nAnd maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed\nWhich is ironic because when I wasn't honest\nI was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)\nNow we're estranged\n[Chorus]\nThings I once enjoyed\nJust keep me employed now\nThings I'm longing for\nSomeday, I'll be bored of\nIt's so weird\nThat we care so much until we don't\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders\nBut I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong\nI'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor\nTo keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure\n'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise\nWould depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)\n(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm\n[Chorus]\nThings I once enjoyed\nJust keep me employed now, mmm\nThings I'm longing for, mmm\nSomeday, I'll be bored of\nIt's so weird\nThat we care so much until we don't\n[Outro]\nBut next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing\nFor anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine\nI've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna\nWas too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time"
