  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I'm gone\nNo need to wonder\nIf I ever think of you\nThe same moon shines\nThe same wind blows\nFor both of us\nAnd time is but a paper moon\nBe not gone\n[Verse 2]\nThough I'm gone\nIt's just as though I hold\nThe flower that touches you\nA new life grows, \nthe blossom knows\nThere's no one else\nCould warm my heart as much as you\nBe not gone\n[English Chorus]\nLet us cling together as the years go by\nOh my love, my love\nIn the quiet of the night\nLet our candle always burn\nLet us never lose\nThe lessons we have learned\n\n[Japanese Chorus]\n手を取り合ってこのまま行こう\n愛する人よ\n静かな宵に\n光を灯し\n愛しき教えを抱き\n[Verse 3]\nHear my song\nStill, think of me the way\nYou've come to think of me\nThe nights grow long\nBut dreams live on\nJust close your pretty eyes\nAnd you can be with me\nDream on\n[Japanese Chorus]\n手を取り合ってこのまま行こう\n愛する人よ\n静かな宵に\n光を灯し\n愛しき教えを抱き\n[Bridge]\nWhen I'm gone\nThey'll say we're all fools\nAnd we don't understand\nOh, be strong\nDon't turn your heart\nWe're all, you're all\nFor all, for always\n\n[English Chorus]\nLet us cling together as the years go by\nOh my love, my love\nIn the quiet of the night\nLet our candle always burn\nLet us never lose\nThe lessons we have learned\n[Instrumental outro]"
