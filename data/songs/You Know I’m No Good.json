  "lyrics": "Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard\nYour rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt\nYou say why did you do it with him today?\nAnd sniff me out like I was tanqueray\nCause you're my fella, my guy\nHand me your stella and fly\nBy the time I'm out the door\nYou tear me down like Roger Moore\n[Estribillo:]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya, I was troubled\nYou know that I'm no good\nUpstairs in bed, with my ex boy\nHe's in the place, but I can't get joy\nThinking of you in the final throws\nThis is when my buzzer goes\nRun out to meet your chicks and bitter\nYou say when we're married cause you're not bitter\nThere'll be none of him no more\nI cried for you on the kitchen floor\n[Repetir estribillo]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya, I was troubled\nYou know that I'm no good\nSweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain\nWe're like how we were again\nI'm in the tub you're on the seat\nLick your lips as I soak my feet\nThen you notice lickle carpet burn\nMy stomach drops and my guts churn\nYou shrug and it's the worst\nTo truly stuck the knife in first\n\n[Chorus x2]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told ya, I was troubled\nYou know that I'm no good"
