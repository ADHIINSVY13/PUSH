I expect you to aim for the head\nI coulda killed you the first time\nYou don’t have to try and say it louder, nigga\nTrust, we heard you the first time\nIt’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone\nAnd I blame where I came from\nAnd I blame all my day ones\nYou know Chubbs like Draymond\nYou better off not saying nothing\nThem boys they a handful\nThen I hit ‘em with the Hotline\nChris Breezy with the dance moves\nMo-G with the dance moves\nAve Boy with the dance moves\nJimi Hendrix with the solo\nThose are strings that you can’t pull\nYeah, and I could really dish it out\nCome and get it from the source\nFuck with all the word of mouth\nGolden State running practice at my house\nNigga, what am I about?\nYou gon’ really feel it now\nI’m out here…\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nLooking for revenge\nAll summer sixteen\nAll summer sixteen\nPlaying dirty not clean\nOut in front of Four Seasons\nLooking like a damn football team\nAll repping one thing\nLooking for revenge\n[Beat switch]\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nAll you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little\nAll your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle\nYou would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else\nHow am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?\nYou was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us\nHad us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up\nBut I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake\nSay you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway\nThought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say\nWe even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day\n“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say\nI used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay\nNow I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye\nAnd look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying\nI’m that nigga’s what I’m saying\nGetting things done around here\nHow you let me run it down here?\nI’m not even from around here\nSix, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade\nI might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne\nOr give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave\nYeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nLooking for revenge\nAll summer sixteen\nAll summer sixteen\nPlaying dirty not clean\nOut in front of Four Seasons\nLooking like a damn football team\nAll repping one thing\nLooking for...\n[Outro: DJ Khaled]\nThey don’t want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye"
