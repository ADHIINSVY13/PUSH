  "lyrics": "“You don’t need words to tell a story”.\n\nThis song is almost 5 minutes long, but all its words is said in 15 seconds. Few people notice, but all the instrumental part is not in vain: it tries to tell a story.\n[Instrumental Intro]\n[Verse: Alex Turner]\nShe was marrying a matador \nand he was with the weather girl\nA very clever girl who stood out amongst several ones\nA terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret the day\nHe didn't make the rescue from the bullring\nSulking won't get you nowhere, son\nThere's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue\nSmitten, but might not be smitten for long\nIf you're still sitting, she'll soon be smitten and gone\n[Interlude: Matt Helders]\n(One, two\nOne, two, three, four)\n[Instrumental Outro]"
