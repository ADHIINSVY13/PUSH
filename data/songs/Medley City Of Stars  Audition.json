  "lyrics": "City of stars\nAre you shining just for me?\nCity of stars\nThere's so much that I can't see\nWho knows?\nIs this the start of something wonderful and new?\nOr one more dream that I cannot make true?\nBarefoot, she smiled\nAnd leapt, without looking\nAnd tumbled into the Seine\nThe water was freezing\nShe spent a month sneezing\nBut said she would do it again\nHere's to the ones who dream\nFoolish as they may seem\nHere's to the hearts that ache\nHere's to the mess we make\nShe told me:\n\"A bit of madness is key\nTo give us new colors to see\nWho knows where it will lead us?\nAnd that's why they need us\"\n\nSo bring on the rebels\nThe ripples from pebbles\nThe painters, and poets, and plays\nAnd here's to the fools who dream\nCrazy as they may seem\nHere's to the hearts that break\nHere's to the mess we make\nCity of stars\nAre you shining just for me?\nCity of stars\nYou never shined so brightly"
