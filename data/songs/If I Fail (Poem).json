  "lyrics": "pages 26 & 27\nIf in my quest\n \n2\n achieve my goals\nI stumble or crumble and lose my soul\nThose that knew me would easily co-sign\nThere was never a life as hard as mine\nNo father\n - no money - no chance and no guide\nI only follow my voice inside\nIf it guides me wrong and I do not win\nI'll learn from mistakes and try 2 achieve again."
