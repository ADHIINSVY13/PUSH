  "lyrics": "As the final track of the American release of this album, the burned lover chooses ultimately to seek out companionship in her dog.\n\"It's him or me, that's what he said\nBut I can't choose between a vegan and a pothead\nSo I chose you because you're sweet\nAnd you give me lots of lovin' and you eat meat\nAnd that's how you became my only man of the hour\nYou never lie and you don't cheat\nAnd you don't have any baggage tied to your four feet\nDo I deserve to be the one who will feed you breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\nAnd take you to the park at dawn?\nWill you really be my only man of the hour?\nI know you'll never bring me flowers\nBut flowers, they will only die\nAnd though we'll never take a shower together\nI know you'll never make me cry\nYou never argue, you don't even talk\nAnd I like the way you let me lead you when we go outside and walk\nWill you really be my only man of the hour?\nMy only man of the hour\nMy only man of the hour\nRuff!"
