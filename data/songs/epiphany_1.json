  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nKeep your helmet, keep your life, son\nJust a flesh wound, here's your rifle\nCrawling up the beaches now\n\"Sir, I think he's bleeding out\"\nAnd some things you just can't speak about\n[Chorus]\nWith you I serve, with you I fall down, down\nWatch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out\n[Verse 2]\nSomething med school did not cover\nSomeone's daughter, someone's mother\nHolds your hand through plastic now\n\"Doc, I think she's crashing out\"\nAnd some things you just can't speak about\n[Bridge]\nOnly twenty minutes to sleep\nBut you dream of some epiphany\nJust one single glimpse of relief\nTo make some sense of what you've seen\n[Chorus]\nWith you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)\nWatch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out\nWith you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)\nWatch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)\n\n[Outro]\nOnly twenty minutes to sleep\nBut you dream of some epiphany\nJust one single glimpse of relief\nTo make some sense of what you've seen"
