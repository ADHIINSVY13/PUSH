  "lyrics": "Once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy\nEver and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart afire to stay\nOnce you're kissed by Amy, tear up your list it's Amy\nPly her with bonbons, poetry, and flowers, moon a million hours away\nYou might be quite the fickle-hearted rover so carefree and bold\nWho loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold\nBut once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy\nEver and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble is the answer will be\nThat Amy'd rather stay in love with me\n(instrumental), always in love with Amy\nEver and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart afire to stay\n(instrumental), get rid of your list it's Amy\nPly her with bonbons, poetry, and flowers, moon a million hours away\nYou might be quite the fickle-hearted rover so carefree and bold\nWho loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold\nBut once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy\nEver and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble is the answer will be\nThat Amy'd rather stay in love with me"
