  "lyrics": "Once I was a sentimental thing\nThrew my heart away each spring\nBut now a spring romance hasn't got a chance\nPromised my first dance to winter\nAnd all I've got to show's a splinter for my little fling\nSpring this year has got me feeling\nLike a horse that's never left the post\nI lie in my room staring up at the ceiling\nSpring can really hang you up the most\nMorning's kiss wakes trees and flowers\nAnd to them I'd like to drink a toast\nI walk in the park just to kill lonely hours\nSpring can really hang you up the most\nAll winter long, those birds, they twitter-twit\nI know the song, \"This is love, this is it\"\nHeard it before and I know the score\nAnd I've decided that spring is a bore\nDoctors once prescribed a tonic\n\"Sulphur and molasses\" was the dose\nThat didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic\nSpring can really hang you up the most\n\nI am all alone, the party is over\nOld man winter was a gracious host\nBut when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover\nSpring can really hang you up the most"
