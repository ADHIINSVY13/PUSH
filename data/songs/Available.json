(\nYeah-yeah\n)\nJust tell me, \"Yeah\"\n'Cause for you, I am\nYou know I am\nDon't mean to sound desperate\nBut you made it like this\nSay I'm number one on your to-do list\nAre you available (\nYeah-yeah\n)\nLike I'm available?\n[Post-Chorus]\nGot my arms wide open (Arms wide open)\nGot my arms wide open (Arms wide open)"
