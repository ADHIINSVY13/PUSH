  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen the shades are drawn\nAnd the light of the moon is banned\nAnd the stars up above\nWalk the heavens hand in hand\nThere's a shady place\nAt the end of the working day\nWhere young lovers go\nAnd this hot little trio plays\n[Chorus 1]\nThat's where we meet\nThat's where we meet\nMe and you rendezvous\nIn the club at the end of the street\nOoh, where we meet\nOoh, where we meet\nMe and you rendezvous\nIn the club at the end of the street\n[Verse 2]\nFrom the alleyways\nWhere the catwalks gently sway\nYou hear the sound of \nOtis\nAnd the voice of Marvin Gaye\n\nIn this smoky room\nThere's a jukebox plays all night\nAnd we can dance real close\nBeneath the pulse of a neon light\n[Chorus 2]\nThat's where we meet\nThat's where we meet\nMe and you rendezvous\nIn the club at the end of the street\nOoh, where we meet\nOoh, where we meet\nMe and you rendezvous\nIn the club at the end of the street\n[Bridge]\nThere's a downtown smell of cooking\nFrom the flame on an open grill\nThere's a sax and a big bass pumping\nLord, have mercy\nOoh, you can't sit still\nOh, you can't sit still\n[Saxophone solo: Vince Denham]\n\n[Chorus 3]\nOh, that's where we meet\nThat's where we meet\nMe and you, rendezvous\nIn the club at the end of the street\nOoh, where we meet\nHooh! Where we meet\nMe and you, rendezvous\nIn the club at the end of the street\n[Ad-libs]\nOh, oh, yeah!\nYou can't sit still\nWhere we meet\nIn the club at the end of the street\nYou can't sit still\nWhere we meet\nIn the club at the end of the street\nCan't sit still\nWhere we meet\nAt the club at the end of the street\nWhere we meet\nWhere we meet\nAt the club at the end of the street\n\nOh!\nYou can't sit still"
