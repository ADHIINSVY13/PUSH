  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLately, I have had the strangest feeling\nWith no vivid reason here to find\nYet the thought of losing you's been hanging\n'Round my mind\nFar more frequently you're wearing perfume\nWith you say, no special place to go\nBut when I ask, \"Will you be coming back soon?\"\nYou don't know, never know\n[Chorus]\nWell, I'm a man of many wishes\nI hope my premonition misses\nBut what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide\n‘Cause they always start to cry\n‘Cause this time could mean goodbye\n[Verse 2]\nLately I've been staring in the mirror\nVery slowly picking me apart\nTrying to tell myself I have no reason\nWith your heart\nJust the other night while you were sleeping\nI vaguely heard you whisper someone's name\nBut when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping\nYou just say nothing's changed\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I'm a man of many wishes\nI hope my premonition misses\nBut what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide\n‘Cause they always start to cry\n‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye\nOh, I'm a man of many wishes\nI hope my premonition misses\nBut what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide\n‘Cause they always start to cry\n‘Cause this time could mean goodbye"
