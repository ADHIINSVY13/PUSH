You told me I was your savior\nSavor your breath, I'm 'bout to take off, hope I never see you later\nI be rollin' out, and I ain't fuckin' with nobody\nGot a .44 sittin' by my waist\nKeep a low profile, yeah, I rather be isolated\nTell them hoes right now to get the fuck out my face\nI've been holdin' out, not even at my full potential\nHeart is cold and I can't even feel my fuckin' face\nI'm gettin' older now, I'm lookin' over my shoulders when I'm bendin' corners now\nAnd I'm in a real bad mental state, yuh\nLook at my face, I'm 'bout to kill somebody\nFeel the weight of the world all over my body, yuh\nLook at my face, I wanna kill somebody\nAnd fuck the world, you can't get to my brain\n\n[Chorus: Boobie Lootaveli]\nThe lights, they shined away\nBut not nowhere as bright as you\nThe night survives again\nBut we get lost inside this room\nYou're right, I'm hot again\nI feel the heat tear down this roof\nThe night survives again\nBut we get lost inside this room\n[Outro: Boobie Lootaveli]\nLonging for your touch\nI don't wanna go without your love\nLonging for your touch\nI don't wanna go without your love\nLonging for your touch\nI don't wanna go without your love\nLonging for your touch\nI don't wanna go without your love"
