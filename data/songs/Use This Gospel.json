I'm crooked as Vegas\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nUse this gospel for protection\nIt's a hard road to Heaven\nWe call on Your blessings\nIn the Father, we put our faith\nKing of the kingdom\nOur demons are tremblin'\nHoly angels defendin'\nIn the Father, we put our faith\n[Verse 2: No Malice]\nA lot of damaged souls, I done damaged those\nAnd in my arrogance, took a camera pose\nCaught with a trunk of Barry Manilows\nThey sing a different tune when the slammer close\nFrom the concrete grew a rose\nThey give you Wraith talk, I give you faith talk\nBlindfolded on this road, watch me faith walk\nJust hold on to your brother when his faith lost\n[Saxophone Solo: Kenny G]\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nOh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh-oh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)\nOh-oh, oh, oh (\nWork, work, work, work\n)"
