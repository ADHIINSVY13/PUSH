  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDraw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man\nYou did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them\nSometimes, I wonder which one'll be your last lie\nThey say looks can kill and I might try\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't dress for women\nI don't dress for men\nLately, I've been dressin' for revenge\n[Chorus]\nI don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends\nDon't get sad, get even\nSo on the weekends\nI don't dress for friends\nLately, I've been dressin' for revenge\n[Verse 2]\nShe needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some\nShe had the envelope, where you think she got it from?\nNow she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride\nPicture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd she looks so pretty\nDrivin' in your Benz\nLately, she's been dressin' for revenge\n\n[Chorus]\nShe don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends\nDon't get sad, get even\nSo on the weekends\nShe don't dress for friends\nLately, she's been dressin' for revenge\n[Bridge]\nLadies always rise above\nLadies know what people want\nSomeone sweet and kind and fun\nThe lady simply had enough\n[Verse 3]\nWhile he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine\nSomeone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I don't dress for villains\nOr for innocents\nI'm on my vigilante shit again\n[Chorus]\nI don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends\nDon't get sad, get even\nSo on the weekends\nI don't dress for friends\nLately, I've been dressin' for revenge"
