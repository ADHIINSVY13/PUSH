How could it be?\n[Chorus]\nThere is somethin' between us\nBetween me and you\nThere is somethin' between us\nI see right through, I see right through\n[Verse 2]\nI \nhad a version of home, and just like that\nI was left to live without it, left to live without it\nI had a person I loved, and just like that\nI was left to live without him, left to live without him\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWaitin' for the storm to pass\nWaitin' on this side of the glass\nBut I see my reflection in you, see your reflection in me\nHow can it be? How can it be?\n\n[Chorus]\nThere is somethin' between us\nBetween me and you\nThere is somethin' between us\nI see right through, I see right through\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nThere is somethin' between us\nBetween me and you\nThere is somethin' between us\nI see right through, I see right through\n[Outro]\nI had a vision of you, and just like that\nI was left to live without it, left to live without it\nWaitin' on this side of the glass"
