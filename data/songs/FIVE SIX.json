I don't know\nI don’t control what these grown men think about when they solo\nI'm sick of the photos for people I don't know\nSo I put tints on that four-door\nI'd rather be nothing than noticed\nI'd rather be something than nothing, I come slow\nI need the money, keep the fame and the drugs and the pain and the lames from my face\nThe waves in the lanes that I paved way back in the day\nKeep me cruisin' away from the ladders and the nooses\n\n[Chorus]\nFive six, grew an inch with them Timbs on\nI need forty-five thousand to sing songs\nNow they mad cause they bitch gon' sing along\nYou ain't gotta worry, homie, I just wanna be alone\nFive six, grew an inch with them Timbs on\nI need forty-five thousand to sing songs\nNow they mad cause they bitch gon' sing along\nYou ain't gotta worry, homie, I just wanna be alone\n[Post-Chorus]\nYeah, I don't need nobody help but I feel like I'm dyin'\nBeggin' for someone to pick me up and keep me thrivin'\nIf I said I love myself, I know I would be lyin'\nLookin' up at the stars and I can't see myself survivin'\n[Outro]\nI don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain\nI don't ever wanna maintain, maintain\nI'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay\nPray you never get lonely, lonely\nI don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain\nI don't ever wanna maintain, maintain\nI'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay\nPray you never get lonely, lonely\nI don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain\nI don't ever wanna maintain, maintain\nI'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay\nPray you never get lonely, lonely\nI don't wanna feel the same pain, same pain\nI don't ever wanna maintain, maintain\nI'm just hopin' that you're okay, okay\nPray you never get lonely, lonely"
