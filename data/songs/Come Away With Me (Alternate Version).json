  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCome away with me in the night\nCome away\nAnd I will write you a song\n[Verse 2]\nCome away with me on a bus\nCome away where they can't tempt us\nWith their lies\n[Bridge]\nAnd I wanna walk with you\nOn a cloudy day\nIn fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high\nSo won't you try to come\n[Verse 3]\nCome away with me and we'll kiss\nOn a mountaintop\nCome away\nAnd I'll never stop loving you\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n[Outro]\nI wanna wake up with the rain\nFalling on a tin roof\nWhile I'm safe there in your arms\nSo all I ask is\nCome away with me in the night\nCome away with me\nCome away\nCome away with me in the night"
