It's been a while\nMama, look at your son, what happened to my smile?\nMy tears is tatted,\n \nmy rag in my pocket\nI'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it\nChampagne for the pain\n, \nweed for the low\nGoddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?\nI'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment\nI look in the mirror, my only opponent\nWhere the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the pres'?\nEither they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed\nNo crying in public, just lying to judges\nRiskin' my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well\n\n[Outro: Swizz Beatz]\nWelcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well\nGoddammit"
