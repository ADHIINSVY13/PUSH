  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]\nWhen I met you last night, baby\nBefore you opened up your gap\nI had respect for you, lady\nBut now, I take it all back\n'Cause you gave me all your pussy\nAnd you even licked my balls\nLeave your number on the cabinet\nAnd I promise, baby, I'll give you a call\nNext time I'm feeling kinda horny\nYou can come on over\nAnd I'll break you off\nAnd if you can't fuck that day, baby\nJust lay back and open your mouth\n'Cause I have never met a girl\nThat I love in the whole wide world\n[Verse 2: Kurupt]\nWell if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke\nI'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke\nI gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me\nDo we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie\nI have no love for hoes\nThat's something that I learned in Tha Pound\nSo how the fuck am I supposed\nTo pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?\nI know the pussy's mine\nSo I'mma fuck a couple more times\nAnd then I'm through with it\nThere's nothing else to do with it\nPass it to the homie, now you hit it\nCause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me\nAnd y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me\nI gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?\nApproach her with a different proposition\nI'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\n[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]\nGuess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?\nWith a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth\nHoes recognize, niggas do too\n'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo\nWhat you gon' do? You really don't know\nSo I'd advise you not to trust that ho\nSilly of me to fall in love with a bitch\nKnowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip\nNow, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger\nHow many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?\nDoggy, I'm all the above\nI'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes\nBut see, it ain't no fun\nIf my homies can't get a taste of it\n'Cause you know I don't love em\n[Verse 4: Warren G]\nSee Kurupt don't give a fuck, Snoop don't give a fuck\nSo guess I'll just say that I don't give a fuck\nBecause bitches ain't shit but they seem kind of funny\nWhen you getting to the rap game and you makin' money\nBut back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'\nJust get on your knees and then start jugglin'\nThese motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth\nIt's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout, whoo!"
