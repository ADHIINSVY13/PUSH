(\nThank you, Jesus\n)\nEver wish you had another life?\nEver wish you had another life?\nEver wish you had another life?\n[Verse 1]\nDon't you wish the night would go numb?\nI've been feelin' low for so long\nI ain't had a high in so long\nI been in the dark for so long\nNight is always darkest 'fore the dawn\nGotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone\nI don't wanna die alone\nI don't wanna die alone\nI get mad when she gone\nMad when she home\nSad when she gone\nMad when she home\nSad when she gone (\nLoosen right now, the spirit that wants to run\n)\nFloatin' on a silver lining (\nIn the name of Jesus\n)\nYeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining\nAnd my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, \"Get behind me\"\nAnd all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time\nYou know exactly where to find me\n\n[Interlude]\nHallelujah\n (\nThank you, Jesus\n)\nHallelujah\n (\nYes\n)\nHallelujah...\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid those ideas ever really come to life?\nMake it all come to life\nMake it all come to life\nPrayin' for a change in your life\nWell, maybe it's gon' come tonight\n[Chorus]\nSadness settin' in again\nThree, two, one, you're pinned\nUncle right back in the pen'\nTell me how auntie been\nTook your thoughts and penciled 'em in\nShould've wrote 'em down in pen\nAnd maybe they'll come to life\nAnd maybe they'll come to life\nSadness settin' in again\nThree, two, one, you're pinned\nUncle right back to the pen'\nTell me how auntie been\nThoughts, you had penciled 'em in\nProbably should've wrote 'em in pen\nAnd maybe they'll come to life\nThey could finally come to life\nThey could finally come to life\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know where to find me, they cannot define me\nSo they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?\nCome and purify me, come and sanctify me\nYou the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam\nBrought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes\nThis is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free\nFloatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining\nSo when I'm free, I'm free"
