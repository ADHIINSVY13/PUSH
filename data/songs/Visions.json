  "lyrics": "“Visions” is the first and only song sang by Don Felder in the Eagles.\n[Verse]\nVisions, that you stir in my soul\nVisions, that will never grow old\nSweet baby, i had some visions of you\nIf i can't have it all, just a taste will do\nGo ahead and live all your fantasies\n(Don't you ever think about the other side?)\nHelps you get from where you are\nTo where you want to be\n(You and me ought to be taking a ride)\nYou do the best you can\nAnd you make your mistakes\n(If you don't like it, you can say that you tried)\nBecause all i have to give is whatever it takes\nPlay on, el chingadero, play on\nPlay on, el chingadero\nDance, angel, dance until you wear out your blues\n(Only thing that's gonna save you now)\nTake another chance, you got nothing to lose\n(The boy didn't love you anyhow)\nGirl, you drive me wild when you do what you do\n(Something makes me want to take you down)\nIf i can't have it all, just a taste will do\nJust a taste of you"
