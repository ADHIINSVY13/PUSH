  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThink about your lips and the way they kiss\nThere's so much I really miss about you\nSitting on the beach, you were still in reach\nAnd I haven't felt free without you\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll of the memories feel like magic\nAll of the fighting seems so sweet\nAll that we were, my love, was tragic\nAnd you're the last thing that I need\n[Chorus]\nSo I lay a dozen roses\nFor the lover that I've lost\nI stand by all my choices\nEven though I paid the cost\nOh, all those nights, the lows and highs\nI share them all with you\nSo I lay a dozen roses\nI lay them there, I lay them there for you, mmm\n[Verse 2]\nYou've been on my mind every single night\nI can't visualize life without you\nI've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep\nBut there's something that I need to go through\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll of the memories feel like magic\nAll of the fighting seems so sweet\nAll that we were, my love, was tragic\nAnd you're the last thing that I need\n[Chorus]\nSo I lay a dozen roses\nFor the lover that I've lost\nI stand by all my choices\nEven though I paid the cost\nOh, all those nights, the lows and highs\nI share them all with you\nSo I lay a dozen roses\nI lay them there, I lay them there for you\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh\n[Chorus]\nSo I lay a dozen roses\nFor the lover that I've lost\nI stand by all my choices\nEven though I paid the cost\nOh, all those nights, lows and highs\nI share them all with you\nSo I lay a dozen roses\nI lay them there, I lay them there for you"
