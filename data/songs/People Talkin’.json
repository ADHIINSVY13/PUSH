Throw in the towel\nI'm better with vowels\nI'm a man of principles; damn-near invincible\nIn my own mind now that my soul's aligned\nI didn't know before now my role's defined:\nTake hold and control what's mine\nCome and get me!\nCome and take my life, you comin' wit me\nCome and try to take me for granted\nI'll take you off this planet\nDammit, man this is a gift from God, this ain't happenstance\nAnd your arms are too short to box\nPlus we knuckle up unorthodox\nYou can't take me off my grind, get off my cock\nWhatchu thought? It's the Roc\nI hear the—\nI hear the—\nI hear the—\nBack in the mix of the scuffle\nSince '86 I was sick with the hustle (Woo!)\nGet a couple of chicks to touch you (Woo!)\nFeather-weight fucker dont ever hate on the brothers (Uh)\nHah, just playin' with you niggas, I'ma stop now\nI ain't gotta sell another record in my life\nThe Blueprint 2, baby! (Mm-hmm)\nSee y'all in November (Oh shit!)\n\n[Hook: Sample]\nI hear the people talk (C'mon)\nYes sir and when you walk (C'mon)\nYour kind is hard to find\nDarling, I'm—"
