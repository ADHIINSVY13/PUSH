Will I borrow?\nI don't care, I don't care (Anyway)\nCome on, come on, the time is right\nThe man is evil and that is right\nI told you (Ah, yes, I told you)\nAnd that's no lie (Oh, no, no)\n\n[Chorus]\nWouldn't you like to know?\nWouldn't you like to know?\nWouldn't you like to know?\nGreat King Rat was a dirty old man\nAnd a dirty old man was he\nNow what did I tell you?\nWould you like to see?\nShow me!\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nWouldn't you like to know?\nWouldn't you like to know, people? (People)\nGreat King Rat was a dirty old man\nAnd a dirty old man was he\nNow what did I tell you?\nWould you like to see?\nHit it!\n[Bridge]\nNow listen, all you people\nPut out the good and keep the bad\nDon't believe all you read in the Bible\nYou sinners get in line\nSaints you leave far behind\nVery soon you're gonna be his disciple\nDon't listen to what Mama says\nNot a word, not a word Mama says\nOr else you'll find yourself being the rival, sure\nThe great Lord, before he died\nKnelt sinners by his side\nAnd said, \"You're going to realize tomorrow\"\nNo, I'm not gonna tell you what you already know\n'Cause time and time again\nThe old man said it all a long time ago\nCome, come on, the time is right\nThis evil man will fight\nI told you once before\nOoh, hear it\nDirty old man\nDirty old man\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nWouldn't you like to know?\nWouldn't you like to know?\nJust like I said before\nGreat King Rat was a dirty old man\nAnd a dirty old man was he\nThe last time I tell you\nWould you like to see?\n[Drums Solo Outro]"
