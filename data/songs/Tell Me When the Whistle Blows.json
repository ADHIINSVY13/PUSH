  "artist": "Elton John",
  "lyrics": "This song is completely about Bernie, and the way he has changed since he answered the ad for songwriters and paired up with Elton John and achieved monumental success.\n[Verse 1]\nThere's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now\nMmm, He's blind and he's old\nAnd there's a bottle that rolls down the road\nMe, I'm young and I'm so wild\nAnd I still feel the need\nOf your apron strings once in a while\nFor there's taxi cabs a-hooting\nBut I can't be foot-loose forever\nMy suitcase it's a cheap one\nMy darling, she's a dear one\nMy head's feeling light as a feather\n[Chorus]\nTake my ears and tell me when the whistle blows\nWake me up and tell me when the whistle blows\nLong lost and lonely boy\nYou're just a black sheep going home\nI want to feel your wheels of steel\nUnderneath my itching heels\nTake my money\nTell me when the whistle blows\n[Verse 2]\nPart of me asked the young man for the time\nWith a cool vacant stare\nOf undue concern, he said nine\nIt's not so bad but I really do love the land\nAnd rather all this than those diamante lovers\nIn Hyde Park holding hands\nBlowing heat through my fingers\nTrying to kill off this cold\nWill the street kids remember?\nCan I still shoot a fast cue?\nHas this country kid still got his soul?\n\n[Chorus]\nTake my ears and tell me when the whistle blows\nWake me up and tell me when the whistle blows\nLong lost and lonely boy\nYou're just a black sheep going home\nI want to feel your wheels of steel\nUnderneath my itching heels\nTake my money\nTell me when the whistle blows\nTake my money\nTell me when the whistle blows"
