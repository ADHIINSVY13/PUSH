  "lyrics": "pages 46 & 47\nI don't have everything\nAs a matter of fact I don't have anything,\nexcept a dream of a better day\nAnd you, to help me find my way\nBeing a man I am sure to make mistakes\nBut to keep you, I would do all it takes\nand if it meant my love was really true\nI'd gladly die and watch over you\nI wish you knew how much I cared\nYou'd see my love is true. By the life we'd share\nEven if you changed your mind and said our love was thru\nI'd want to die, continuously cry and still I'd love you"
