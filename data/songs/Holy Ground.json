  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was reminiscing just the other day\nWhile having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away\nBack to a first-glance feeling on New York time\nBack when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme\nTook off faster than a green light, go\nHey, you skip the conversation when you already know\nI left a note on the door with a joke we'd made\nAnd that was the first day\n[Chorus]\nAnd darling, it was good\nNever looking down\nAnd right there where we stood\nWas holy ground\n[Verse 2]\nSpinning like a girl in a brand new dress\nWe had this big wide city all to ourselves\nWe blocked the noise with the sound of, \"I need you\"\nAnd for the first time, I had something to lose\nAnd I guess we fell apart in the usual way\nAnd the story's got dust on every page\nBut sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now\nAnd I see your face in every crowd\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause darling, it was good\nNever looking down\nAnd right there where we stood\nWas holy ground\n[Bridge]\nTonight, I'm gonna dance\nFor all that we've been through\nBut I don't wanna dance\nIf I'm not dancing with you\nTonight, I'm gonna dance\nLike you were in this room\nBut I don't wanna dance\nIf I'm not dancing with you\n[Chorus]\nIt was good\nNever looking down\nAnd right there where we stood\nWas holy ground\n[Outro]\nTonight, I'm gonna dance\nFor all that we've been through\nBut I don't wanna dance\nIf I'm not dancing with you\nTonight, I'm gonna dance\nLike you were in this room\nBut I don't wanna dance\nIf I'm not dancing with you"
