Yuh\nBaby, I know that you played me\nLately, I'm still feeling like you're made for me\nSave me, baby, don't let me go\nDown this cold ass road alone, yuh, yuh\nYou don't wanna take me back now\nThen take the bullets in my back out\n'Cause, baby, you were made for me\nYou're the only one that's saving me, yuh, yuh\n\n[Chorus]\nBack then you was holdin' my gun\nThese days you the one I gotta run away from\nYou a heartbreaker, my lil' Florida thang\nGot me hangin' out the window just yellin' your name, yuh\nWhen I see you, I'ma ride right by\nBut when I need you, I'ma bang your line 'cause\nI don't wanna be alone\nEverybody needs somebody when they get alone (Yuh)\nBack then you was holdin' my gun\nThese days you the one I gotta run away from\nYou a heartbreaker, my lil' Florida thang\nGot me hangin' out the window just yellin' your name, yuh\nWhen I see you, I'ma ride right by\nBut when I need you, I'ma bang your line 'cause\nI don't wanna be alone\nEverybody needs somebody when they get alone (Yuh)"
