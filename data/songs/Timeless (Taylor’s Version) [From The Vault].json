  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDown the block, there's an antique shop\nAnd something in my head said, \"Stop,\" so I walked in\nOn the counter was a cardboard box\nAnd the sign said, \"Photos: twenty-five cents each\"\nBlack and white, saw a 30s bride\nAnd school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house\nThe kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime\nThe kind you don't put down\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain\nBut in those photos, I saw us instead\nAnd, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other\nIn another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met\n[Chorus]\nOn a crowded street in 1944\nAnd you werе headed off to fight in the war\nYou still would've been mine\nWe would have been timeless\nI would've read your love letters every single night\nAnd prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right\nAnd you would've been fine\nWe would have been timeless\n'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this\nSo, even in a different life, you still would've been mine\nWe would've been timeless\n\n[Verse 2]\nI had to smile when it caught my eye\nThere was one of a teenage couple in the driveway\nHoldin' hands on the way to a dance\nAnd the date on the back said 1958\nWhich brought me back to the first time I saw you\nTime stood still like somethin' in this old shop\nI thought about it as I started lookin' 'round\nAt these precious things that time forgot\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs\nStory of a romance torn apart by fate\nHundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did\nAnd I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face\n[Chorus]\nIn the 1500s, off in a foreign land\nAnd I was forced to marry another man\nYou still would've been mine\nWe would have been timeless\nI would've read your love letters every single night\nAnd run away and left it all behind\nYou still would've been mine\nWe would've been timeless\n'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this\nSo, even in a different life, you still would've been mine\nWe would've been timeless\n\n[Bridge]\nTime breaks down your mind and body\nDon't you let it touch your soul\nIt was like an age-old classic\nThe first time that you saw me\nThe story started when you said, \"Hello\"\n[Chorus]\nIn a crowded room a few short years ago\nAnd sometimes there's no proof, you just know\nYou're always gonna be mine\nWe're gonna be\nI'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray\nWe'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made\nAnd you'll say, \"Oh my, we really were timeless\"\n[Post-Chorus]\nWe're gonna be timeless, timeless\nYou still would've been mine\nWe would've been\nEven if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944\nYou still would've been mine\nWe would've been\n[Outro]\nDown the block, there's an antique shop\nAnd somethin' in my head said, \"Stop,\" so I walked in"
