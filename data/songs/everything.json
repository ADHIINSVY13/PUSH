an almanac\nPeople do anything to be involved in everything\nInclusion is a hell of a drug\nSome people have everything they probably ever wanted in life\nAnd never have enough\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nIf I had everything, everything\nI could change anything\nIf I changed anything, I mean anything\nI would change everything, oh yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nFrom the birth of a child, the world is foul\nExcursions of a searchin' child\nShould learn to take nothin' personal\nA parent hates to watch his baby's face\nTakin' his first immunization shots, but this is great\nThe child's introduction to suffering and pain\nUnderstands without words, nothin' is explained\nOr rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face\nLike, \"I thought you would protect me from this scary place?\"\n\"Why'd you let them inject me?\"\n\"Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?\"\nWho knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?\nIf Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me\nI need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso\nSoon enough, assume the cuffs, the position\nNot new to us, since back on the bus sittin'\nSaid, \"Screw that bus!\" – boycotted that bus outta business\nThe future's us, yet every citizen's in prison\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nIf I had everything, everything\nI could change anything\nIf I changed anything, I mean anything\nI would change everything, oh yeah\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nWatch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi\nIn Italy, I'm Eduardo Baccari\nBut Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur\nAnd I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure\nMy first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion\nIt was haunted by dead rich whites\nMad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ\nCircular driveways, black cars and black ice\nMy second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money\nChilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny\nDid good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria\nWhat you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior\nDid every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky\nIt was important to a guy who was mob-minded\nFuture Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me\nI started likin' the look like I ain't had no money\nYellow taxi seats over Maybach seats\nJust to remind me, just to inspire me\nTo stay focused, it's a real sick society\nJust 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me\nI'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters\nWhere my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper\nMade a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action\nTo lay claim the Pan-African made it happen\n[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West and \nThe\n-Dream\n]\nYou'll live, and you'll learn\nSee 'cause you've never been the same anyone else\nDon't think the same as everyone else\nYou'll live, and you'll learn\nSee you'll never conclude with anyone else\nDon't think the same as everyone else\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nIf I had everything, everything\nI could change anything\nIf I changed anything, I mean anything\nI would change everything\n, oh yeah\n[Post-Chorus: The-Dream & \nKanye West\n]\nDark boy, don't you cry\nThere's too much life left in those eyes\nDon't you let that face go waterfall\nDon't you learn to love your scars and all\nDark boy, don't you die\nThey're just human, let them lie\nYou just know your world and speak your truth\nAnd let them come to you\nFor you'll love, in your heart\nSee 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else\nDon't think the same as everyone else\nThis is your call, there are no wrongs\nSee you'll never conclude with anyone else\nDon't think the same as everyone else"
