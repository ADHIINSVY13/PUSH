to hurt you...\n[Chorus]\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nSorry it's gotta be that way\nI ain't mean to desert you\nSorry that it look that way\nAin't really tryna hurt you\nAin't really mean to hurt you\nI ain't really try'n hurt you\nSorry it gotta be that way\nI ain't really tryin'\nI ain't really tryin'\n[Verse 1]\nI was in the U.K. thinkin' – shit don't feel the same\nAddy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane\nHard to say you care about me\nWhen this mink draggin' to the floor\nTryna find a P.Y.T., I already got some at home\nI breathe the air she breathe\nIt's hard to breathe on my own\nIt's somethin' 'bout infidelity\nMake me check every single stone\nY'all done drank my blood like a Hebrew\n'Cause I've been gettin' fly since a diesel\nMade her switch sides in Ibizoo\nI can get you off there in Belgium\nDiamonds shinin' off very seldom\nGrab a couple chicks, then mail them\nTake it to the hood, then sell them\nFam come first, never fail them\nRebellious, always respect my elders\nThat's why I might treat you like I'm careless\nSold crack to a pregnant lady\nForgive me for the crack baby\nIf I open up my eyes, it turn black for real\nPack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum-sealed\nWord to Uncle Charles, nigga, I got the set for real\nMoney, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'\nFame change family, that's the way it is\nFame change a ho, that's the way I give\nPaid for my mistakes like a drug deal\nPaid for my mistakes like a drug deal\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nSorry it's gotta be this way\nI ain't even try'n desert you\nStop try'na be this way\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nI ain't really tryin'\n[Verse 2]\nIt can get scary when you legendary\nCaramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry\nCash rules everything around music\nThe game doped up, every nigga usin'\nGrab the fuckin' carpet, hit 'em with the two\nI'm not tryna argue, I got issues\nYou see what I been put up against, baby?\nYou see why I been tryna make the rent, baby?\nTryna keep you closer than lint, baby\nDiamond Rolls, 'bout to get Lynch, baby\nIt's hard to caress you\nAll your bad energy, it's hard to bless you\nCommercial flights gettin' too hectic\nV12 motor's my confession\nTryin' to identify, you look sketchy\nI'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept it\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nSorry it's gotta be this way\nI ain't even try'n desert you\nStop try'na be this way\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nI ain't really tryin'\n[Verse 3]\nHot tender \"Roni\" – Bobby Brown, ooh\nChop this up for me, I got somethin' to prove\nWork every day like I got somethin' to lose\nOxycod' got me floatin' up, nothin' new\nStyrofoam cups, everything is approved\nStyrofoam cups, everything is approved\nMoney stacked up, an' it got me seduced\nI got that hot dope, but I got that boost doe\nAye – my Lamb' hit a pothole, these bitches some thot hoes\nI hit the lotto in South Africano\nYacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo\nBetter not be late, bitch, \nyou better come pronto\nBetter come with a combo\nAsian persuasion, Cubana, mijaña\nYolanda, Shalonda, mi añá muy paza\nI don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper\nIt became problems when I didn't send flowers\nKing like Mufasa\n, Messiah, then higher\nGold sheets and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police\nShout out my whodie, he smashin' the CO\nMy wrist got a ego, my watch in an igloo\nWe took it legal, got stripes like a zebru\nLive like a Rolling Stone, high when I greet you\nDiamonds just all on you, effortlessly ball on you\nL-O-to-V-E\n, I hope you ain’t gettin' greedy\nChasers do numbers, man, chains is on Fiji\nCouldn'ta had your heart, 'cause ya gave it too easy\nDiamonds on sight that's way brighter than Geezy's\nShout out to D.D., got goonies on speedy\nShe like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG\nI had evaded, I thought I was jaded\nPersian, Malaysian, super sensation\nYah – sushi was raw when she got confiscated\nNo invitations, we showed up and made it\nLong as my dawgs here, bitches be tradin'\nPigeons contagious, I shoulda known it\nI turned the pages, heavily sedated\nToo many clone me, too many phonies\nArmani on me, you never worn me\nHow can you blame us when we all out the trenches?\nGold chains and rings, it's so easy gettin' offended\nSpendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image\nFuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny\nFuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty\nI hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'\nCaught her off the runway, she instantly committed\nPaper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city\nIn and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'\nIndian Cherokee, clarity, \nshinin' is therapy\nMami Israeli (\nMami Israeli...\n)\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nSorry it's gotta be this way\nI ain't even try'n desert you\nSorry, ain't tryna be this way\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nAin't really mean to hurt you\n...\nAin't really mean to hurt you...\nAin't really mean to hurt you\n...\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nSorry it's gotta be that way\nAin't mean to desert you\nSorry that it look that way\nI ain't really try'n hurt you\nI ain't really mean to hurt you\nI ain't really tryin'"
