  "lyrics": "“What You Do to Me” marks the sixth song off Darkness and Light. The song alternates from anger to lust and features an electronic beat that is more fast-paced than the previous songs on the album.\n[Verse 1]\nGo from zero to a hundred and up it crazy\nDon't believe it when you say that you fuckin' hate me, no\nUse your tongue to crucify me, you motivate me, oh I\nThrowing down when it ends up with your legs around me\nYour legs around me, oh\nI rise, you fall, we wreck it all\nMy pride is at your beck and call\n[Chorus]\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do, you always do me right\nScreaming through the night\nMake me love and hate you at the same time\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me, yeah\nThat's what you do, you watch me lose my mind\nMake me feel like I...\nI would die if you were out of my life\nThat's what you do to me\n[Verse 2]\nI could stop, I could leave, but no, I don't wanna\nIt's a mess I'm obsessed with your kind of torture\nIt's my kind of torture\nOh, I rise, you fall, we wreck it all\nYou kill me with every kiss and don't you know...\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do, you always do me right\nScreaming through the night\nMake me love and hate you at the same time\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me, yeah\nThat's what you do, you watch me lose my mind\nMake me feel like I...\nI would die if you were out of my life\nThat's what you do to me\n[Bridge]\nI don't know how you take control of me baby\nI don't know how you got a hold\n[Chorus]\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do, you always do me right\nScreaming through the night\nMake me love and hate you at the same time\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do, you always do me right\nScreaming through the night\n(Yeah, that's what you do to me)\nMake me love and hate you at....\nThat's what you do to me, yeah\nThat's what you do, you watch me lose my mind\nMake me feel like I...\nI would die if you were out of my life\nThat's what you do to me\nWhat you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nWhat you do to me\nOh, that's what you do, you always do me right\nScreaming through the night\nMake me love and hate you at the same time, at the same time, at the same time\nThat's what you do to me\nWhat you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do to me\nThat's what you do, you watch me lose my mind\nMake me feel like I...\nI would die if you were out of my life\nThat's what you do to me"
