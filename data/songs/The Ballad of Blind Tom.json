  "lyrics": "[Verse]\n\"Say that boy's a wonderment\"\n\"No! The kid's a freak\"\nBut that kid he don't care none\nHis black hands resting on the keys\nHopping like a big old frog\nAnd hissing like a train\nEntertaining royalty\nAll points east, west and in-between\nGeneral he's a fine old man\nTreat him like his own\n\"Boy wouldn't know from money\"\nJust throw old Blind Tom a bone\nFrom the times of \nKing Cotton\nMay we present to you\nAll you \nJim Crow monkeys\nFrom Harlan County down to Tuscaloo\nPlay me anything you like\nI'll play it back to you\nBe careful what you call me though\nSome things cut clear on through\nI may be an idiot\nI may be a savant\nI didn't choose this life for me\nBut it's something that I want\nCocks that old big head aside\nGrunts a word or two\nKeeps them guessing every night\nIs he really going to make it through\nFaint hearts with their fans out\nStarched collars and cigars\nHe weren't no use for slaving\n\"I wouldn't want him in my yard\""
