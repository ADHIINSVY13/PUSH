Ah\nEven when I miss you on the road\nYou should know I'm always in control\n'Cause the one thing I already know\n[Chorus]\nNo, I don't feel the need to\nTest drive nothin', test drive nothin'\nBaby, I'm sold on you, so I don't ever gotta\nTеst drive nothin' (Oh), test drive nothin' (My baby)\nIt's in thе way you do it, I don't ever gotta, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nI drop the top on that body\nThat's candy paint on my body\nI'm thinkin' 'bout the way I feel on you\nIf you want, say, \"I do\" (I do)\nI'll floor it (I'll floor it)\nJust say the word, you know I'm yours (Know I'm yours)\nJust drop a pin and don't reverse (Oh)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMake me wanna stay through the night (Oh, babe)\nI will never leave from by your side (Leave from by your side)\nDon't you know you got a ride or die? Ah\nEven when I miss you on the road\nYou should know I'm always in control\n'Cause the one thing I already know\n[Chorus]\nNo, I don't feel the need to\nTest drive nothin' (No, babe), test drive nothin'\nBaby, I'm sold on you, so I don't ever gotta\nTest drive nothin', test drive nothin'\nIt's in the way you do it, I don't ever gotta"
