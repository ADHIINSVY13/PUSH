  "lyrics": "Oh, it's a long, long time from May to December\nBut the days grow short when you reach September\nWhen the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame\nOne hasn't got time for the waiting game\nOh, the days dwindle down to a precious few\nSeptember, November\nAnd these few precious days I'll spend with you\nThese precious days I'll spend with you"
