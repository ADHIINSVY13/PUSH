  "lyrics": "Written with Singer/Songwriter Amy Wadge about a friend of hers with cancer, this emotional song was given the title Hold On by fans long before the studio version was released.\n[Verse 1]\nIt's alright to cry, even my dad does sometimes\nSo don't wipe your eyes, tears remind you you're alive\nIt's alright to die 'cause death's the only thing you haven't tried\nBut just for tonight, hold on\n[Chorus]\nSo live life like you're givin' up\n'Cause you act like you are\nGo ahead and just live it up\nGo on and tear me apart\n[Verse 2]\nIt's alright to shake, even my hand does sometimes\nSo, inside, we'll rage against the dyin' of the light\nIt's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried\nBut just for today, hold on\n[Chorus]\nSo live life like you're givin' up\n'Cause you act like you are\nGo ahead and just live it up\nGo on and tear me apart\nAnd hold on\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus]\nMmm, live life like you're givin' up\n'Cause you act like you are\nGo ahead and just live it up\nGo on and tear me apart\nAnd hold on"
