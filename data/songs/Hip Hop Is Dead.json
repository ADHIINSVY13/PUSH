Dirty South!\n)\nHip, hip hop (\nWest Coast!\n)\nHip hop (\nMidwest!\n)\nHip hop (\nLet's go!\n)\n[Chorus: Nas & \nwill.i.am\n]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(\nHip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead\n)\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nYeah, people smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner\nGet cash, live fast, body their man's mama\nQuick fast, trigger fingers on the llama\nRevenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja\nWord to the wise, with villain state of minds\nGrindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind\nGrindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind\n(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)\nWhenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up\nAny ghetto will tell ya, \"Nas helped grow us up\"\nMy face once graced promotional Sony trucks\nHundred million in billin', I helped blow them up\nGave my man my right, I could have went left\nSo, like my girl Foxy, the kid went Def\nSo, people, who's your top 10?\nIs it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?\n\n[Chorus: Nas & \nwill.i.am\n]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(\nHip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead\n)\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nThe bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling\nCome through, something ill, missing the ceiling\nWhat influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings\nKidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings\nCriticize that – why's that?\n'Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack\n'Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens\nMost intellectuals will only half-listen\nSo you can't blame jazz musicians\nOr David Stern with his NBA fashion issues\n\"Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee\"\nYou can't ice me, we here for life, B\nOn my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey\nAnd for that, we not taking it lightly\nIf hip hop should die, we die together\nBodies in the morgue lie together, \nall together now\n\n[Chorus: Nas & \nwill.i.am\n]\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nIf hip hop should die before I wake\nI'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\nRoll to every station, wreck the DJ\n(\nHip hop just died this morning\nHip hop just died this morning\nHip hop just died this morning\nAnd she's dead, she's dead\n)\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nEverybody sound the same,\n commercialize the game\nReminiscing when it wasn't all business\nIt forgot where it started\nSo we all gather here for the dearly departed\nHip-hopper, since a toddler\nOne homeboy became a man, then a mobster\nIf it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka\nR.I.P. – we'll donate your lungs to a rasta\nWent from turntables to MP3's\nFrom \nBeat Street\n to commercials on \nMickey D's\nFrom gold cables to Jacob's\nFrom plain facials to Botox and face lifts\nI'm looking over my shoulder\nIt's about 80 people from my hood that showed up\nAnd they came to show love\nSold out concert and the doors are closed shut"
