  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI turn on the tube and what do I see?\nA whole lot of people crying, \"Don't blame me\"\nThey point their crooked little fingers at everybody else\nSpend all their time feeling sorry for themselves\nVictim of this, victim of that\nYour mamma's too thin and your daddy's too fat\n[Chorus]\nGet over it\nGet over it\nAll this whining and crying and pitching a fit\nGet over it, get over it\n[Verse 2]\nYou say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash\nBut you might feel better if I gave you some cash\nThe more I think about it, Old Billy was right\nLet's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight\nYou don't want to work, you want to live like a king\nBut the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing\n[Chorus]\nGet over it\nGet over it\nIf you donâ€™t wanna play then you might as well quit\nGet over it, get over it\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's like going to confession every time I hear you speak\nYou're making the most of your losing streak\nSome call it sick, but I call it weak\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, you drag it around like a ball and chain\nYou wallow in the guilt, you wallow in the pain\nYou wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown\nGot your mind in the gutter, bringing everybody down\nYou bitch about the present and blame it on the past\nI'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass\n[Chorus]\nGet over it\nGet over it\nAll this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit\nGet over it, get over it\n[Chorus]\nGet over it\nGet over it\nIt's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit?\nGet over it, get over it"
