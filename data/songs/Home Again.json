  "lyrics": "Home Again is the first single released from Elton John’s 2013 album The Diving Board.\n[Verse 1]\nI’m countin' on a memory to get me outta here\nI’m waitin' for the fog around this spooky little town to clear\nAll this time I’ve spent bein' someone else’s friend\nJust one more time, for old time’s sake, I’d like to go back home again\n[Verse 2]\nThe world had seven wonders once upon a time\nIt’s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline\nAnd all around me, I’ve seen times like it was back when\nBut like back then, I’d say amen if I could get back home again\n[Chorus]\nIf I could go back home, if I could go back home\nIf I’d never left, I’d never have known\nWe all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end\nSpendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again\n[Verse 3]\nCould've been a jailbreak and the spotlight hittin' me\nOr was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963\nIn the old part of Valencia on the coast of Spain\nNever tirin' once of hearin' songs about goin' home again\n[Chorus]\nIf I could go back home, if I could go back home\nIf I’d never left, I’d never have known\nWe all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end\nSpendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could go back home, if I could go back home\nIf I’d never left, I’d never have known\nWe all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end\nSpendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again"
