  "lyrics": "When you wake up\nIn the morning and you wonder\nWhy no one's beside you where I usually lay\nAnd you think you hear\nThe sound of a distant thunder\nIt's just your old rock rolling away\nI was your rock standing strong for you\nThere was nothing I wouldn't do\nNo matter the cost I was ready to pay\nNow you say I'm only holding you down\nLike some old rock you've been dragging around\nYes, I'm your rock but I'm rolling away\nI'm rolling away on a downhill grade\nBut I'm coming to rest side\nA mountain of love some day\n'Cause I finally understand\nIf you're resting on shifting sands\nEven a rock goes rolling away\nAnd I was your rock standing strong for you\nThere was nothing I wouldn't do\nNo matter the cost I was ready to pay\nOh now you say I'm only holding you down\nLike some old rock you've been dragging around\nYes, I'm your rock and I'm rolling away"
