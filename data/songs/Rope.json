I thought I was above it all\nOur hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown\n[Pre-Chorus]\nChoke! On our kiss\nThought I'd save my breath for you\nChoke! On our kiss\nThought I'd save my breath for you\n[Chorus]\nGimme some rope, I'm comin' loose\nI'm hangin' on you\nGimme some rope, I'm comin' loose\nI'm pullin' for you now\nGimme some rope, I'm comin'\nOutta my head, into the clear\nWhen you go, I come loose\n[Verse 2]\nThese premonitions got me cryin' up a storm\nLeave your condition, this position does no harm\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nChoke! On our kiss\nThought I'd save my breath for you\nChoke! On our kiss\nThought I'd save my breath for you\n[Chorus]\nGimme some rope, I'm comin' loose\nI'm hangin' on you\nGimme some rope, I'm comin' loose\nI'm pullin' for you now\nGimme some rope, I'm comin'\nOutta my head, into the clear\nWhen you go, I come loose\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nGimme some rope, I'm comin' loose\nI'm hangin' on you\nGimme some rope, I'm comin' loose\nI'm pullin' for you now\nGimme some hope, I'm comin' through\nI'm countin' on you\nGimme some rope, I'm comin'\nOutta my head, into the clear\nWhen you go, I come\nLoose"
