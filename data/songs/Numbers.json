Visionaries never fail\nWhy-why you think I'm independent? Visionaries never f—\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know what I been on, \nyou know where I be at\n'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that\nCatch me in a private jet like, \"Fuck it, where the weed at?\"\nAnd this flight attendant got the fattest ass, you know I need that\nY-y-you know what I been on, you know where I be at\n'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that\nNow these bitches say they love me, but they just obsessed with the image\nYou know what I been on, you know where I be at (\nSinatra\n)\n[Outro]\n\"You gotta realize\nA lot of the time when I talk, and I'm talking extremely cocky\nI'm not talking about myself\nI'm talking about the work.\"\n You know where I be at\nLogic"
