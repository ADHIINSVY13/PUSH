Ultimately he’s thankful for his blessings, especially his daughter Destiny\n[Intro]\nUh, uh\nYo\n[Verse 1]\nThey plan was to knock me out the top of the game\nBut I overstand they truth is all lame\nI hold cannons that shoot balls of flame\nRight in they fat mouth then I carve my name\nNas too real, Nas, true king\nIt's however you feel, go 'head, you swing\nYour arms too short to box with God\nI don't kill soloists, only kill squads\nFame went to they head, so now it's \"Fuck Nas\"\nYesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys\nI seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle\nI spotted my enemies tryna do what I do\nCame in with my style, so I fathered you\nI kept changing on the world since Barbeque\nNow you wanna hang with niggas I hung with\nFuck bitches I hit,\n \nit's funny I once said\nIf I ever make a record, I'll take a check\nAnd put something away for a rainy day to make my exit\nBut look at me now, ten years deep\nSince the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep\nI never asked to be top of rap's elite\nJust a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets\nBut look at me now\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\n[Verse 2]\nNow wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars\nAnd diamond rings can poison a rap star\nWas suicidal, high, smoking so much lye\nI saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky\nWish I could flap wings and fly away\nTo where black kings in Ghana stay\nSo I could get old, my flesh rot away\nBut that'll be the day when it's peace\nWhen my gat don't need to spray\nWhen these streets are safe to play\nSex with death, indulge in these women\nVision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire\nBroads play with pentagrams in they vagina\nLike the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds\nI beg for God's help\n, why they love hurting me?\nI'm your disciple, a thug certainly\nI'm the N, the A to the S-I-R\nIf I wasn't, I must've been Escobar\n.45 in my waist,\n staring at my reflection\nIn the mirror, sitting still in the chair like \nMike Concepcion\nWhen everything around me got cloudy\nThe chair became a king's throne, \nmy destiny found me\nIt was clear why the struggle was so painful\nMetamorphosis, this is what I changed to\nAnd God, I'm so thankful\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man\n[Interlude]\nYo, ugh, look, look, ugh, that's that bitch Wiz was fuckin' (Haha)\nDamn, that's fucked up\nNigga, let's get high, nigga (Roll them dice, nigga, hurry up)\nHighest to the sky, it's four hundred in here, nigga\nWhat the fuck is you niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?\nOne, one, one, all around the bar\nCome on, let's get high, nigga, oh, shit, oh (Oh)\nFour fifty-six, nigga, shut the fuck up\nFuck y'all niggas, run my fuckin' money (Run that back)\nRun that back, man (Bust it back)\nI gotta get high, man, you got weed? (Run that back)\nRun it back? Alright, run it back, c'mon"
