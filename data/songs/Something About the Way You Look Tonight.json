  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere was a time\nI was everythin' and nothin' all in one\nWhen you found me\nI was feelin' like a cloud across the sun\n[Verse 2]\nI need to tell ya\nHow you light up every second of the day\nBut in the moonlight\nYou just shine like a beacon on the bay\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't explain\nBut it's somethin' about the way you look tonight\nTakes my breath away\nIt's that feelin' I get about you deep inside\nAnd I can't describe\nBut it's somethin' about the way you look tonight\nTakes my breath away\nThe way you look tonight\n[Verse 3]\nWith a smile\nYou pull the deepest secrets from my heart\nIn all honesty\nI'm speechless, and I don't know where to start\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't explain\nBut it's somethin' about the way you look tonight\n(Oh) Takes my breath away\nIt's that feelin' I get about you deep inside\nAnd I can't describe\nBut it's somethin' about the way you look tonight\nTakes my breath away\nThe way you look tonight\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't explain\nBut it's somethin' about the way you look tonight\nOh, takes my breath away\nIt's that feelin' I get about you deep inside\nAnd I can't describe\nBut it's something about the way you look tonight\nTakes my breath away\nThe way you look tonight\n[Outro]\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight\n(The way you look) Way you look tonight\nThe way you look tonight"
