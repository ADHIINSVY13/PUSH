Will I quit?\nThey claim that I'm violent, but still I keep\nRepresentin', never give up on a good thing\nWouldn't stop it if we could, it's a hood thing\nAnd now I'm like a major threat\n'Cause I'll remind you of the things you were made to forget\nBring the noise to all my boys\nKnow the real from the busters and the decoys\nAnd if you hustle like a real G\nPump your fist if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me\nLearn to survive in the nine-tre'\nI make rhyme pay, others make crime pay\nWhatever it takes to live and stand\n'Cause nobody else'll give a damn\nSo we live like caged beasts\nWaitin' for the day to let the rage free\nStill me 'til they kill me\nI love it when they fear me\n\n[Chorus]\nHoller if ya hear me!\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n (See it clearly)\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\"\nHoller if ya hear me! \n\"Hard\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\" \"The rebel\"\n\"Tellin' you to hear it\""
