I'm stuck\nSo, party people, are you with me? What's the deal?\nIf you real, grab your chair up by the wheel\nIf you wanna feel just like the Man of Steel\nWindmillin' on a million banana peels, come on\n[Chorus]\nClap your hands and stomp your feet\nEverybody, join together\nCan you feel the funky beat?\nEverywhere you see people laughing and\nDancing in the street\nOn the count of three, everybody do\nThe Christopher Reeves\nOne, two, three, follow me\n\n[Outro]\nWoo\nGood morning, Eminem\nOr Marshall, as others have informed me\nChristopher Reeves here\nYou had better not talk behind my back\nOr I will kick your ass the minute I'm out of this chair\nWatch yourself, Marshall\nI'm watching you\nAh! Holy shit"
