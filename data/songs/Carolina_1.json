  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOh, Carolina creeks running through my veins\nLost I was born, lonesome I came\nLonesome I'll always stay\nCarolina knows why, for years, I roam\nFree as these birds, light as whispers\nCarolina knows\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you didn't see me here\nNo, they never did see me here\nAnd she's in my dreams\n[Chorus]\nInto the mist, into the clouds\nDon't leave\nI make a fist, I'll make it count\nAnd there are places I will never, ever go\nAnd things that only Carolina will ever know\n[Verse 2]\nCarolina stains on the dress she left\nIndelible scars, pivotal marks\nBlue as the life she fled\nCarolina pines, won't you cover me?\nHide me like robes down the back road\nMuddy these webs we weave\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you didn't see me here\nOh, they never did see me\nAnd she's in my dreams\n[Chorus]\nInto the mist, into the clouds\nDon't leave\nI make a fist, I'll make it count\nAnd there are places I will never, ever go\nAnd things that only Carolina will ever know\n[Bridge]\nAnd you didn't see me here\nThey never did see me here\nNo, you didn't see me here\nThey never saw me\n[Outro]\nOh, Carolina knows why for years they've said\nThat I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed\nBut the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts\nIt's between me, the sand, and the sea\nCarolina knows"
