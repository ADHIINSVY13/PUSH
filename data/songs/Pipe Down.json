(Pipe down)\nHow deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nAll the things I've done up until right now (Right now)\nI need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)\nWriting down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)\nDon't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you\nHow much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nHow deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?\n\n[Verse 2]\nTried to run it back a hundred times\nThe world is yours, but the city's mine\nI can't believe you put it on your mother's life\nI can't believe you told me it was ride or die\n'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive\nTrue enough I know you from the other side\nI set my expectations way too high\nYeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night\nAngel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night\nI know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all\nJust to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights\nWhy does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?\nThat nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice\nAnd I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you\nI was on your ass like back pockets\nNiggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?\nSo much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face\n'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face\nYou're the reason we'll be going separate ways\nYou're the reason we cannot communicate\nIt's not the things you say, it's what you don't say\nI'm not in your way, you're in your own way\n[Chorus]\nSo I don't get how you're yelling at me\nHow much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nHow deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nAll the things I've done up until right now (Right now)\nI need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)\nWriting down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)\nDon't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you\nHow much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)\nHow deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, pipe down\nOoh, ooh, ooh"
