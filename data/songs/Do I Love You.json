  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAfter that sweet summer afternoon\nWhen for the first time, I saw you appear\nDreaming of you, I composed a tune\nSo will you listen to it, dear?\n[Verse 1]\nDo I love you, do I?\nDoesn't one and one make two?\nDo I love you, do I?\nDoes July need a sky of blue?\nWould I miss you, would I?\nIf you ever should go away?\nIf the sun should desert the day\nWhat would life be? What would life be?\n[Verse 2]\nWill I leave you never?\nCould the ocean leave the shore?\nWill I worship you forever?\nIsn't Heaven forevermore?\nDo I love you, do I?\nOh, my dear, it's so easy to see\nDon't you know I do? Don't I show you I do?\nJust as you love me\n\n[Verse 3]\nDo I love you, do I?\nOh, my dear, it's so easy to see\nDon't you know I do? Don't I show you I do?\nJust as you love me"
