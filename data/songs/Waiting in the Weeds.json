  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's coming on the end of August\nAnother summer's promise almost gone\nAnd though I heard some wise man say\nThat every dog will have his day\nHe never mentioned that these dog days get so long\nI don't know when I realized the dream was over\nWell, there was no particular hour, no given day\nYou know, it didn't go down in flame\nThere was no final scene, no frozen frame\nI just watched it slowly fade away\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd I've been waiting in the weeds\nWaiting for my time to come around again and\nHope is floating on the breeze\nCarrying my soul high up above the ground and\nI've been keeping to myself\nKnowing that the seasons are slowly changing\nEven though you're with somebody else\nHe'll never love you like I do\n[Verse 2]\nI've been biding time with the crows and sparrows\nWhile peacocks prance and strut upon the stage\nIf finding love is just a dance\nProximity and chance\nYou will excuse me if I skip the masquerade\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd I've been waiting in the weeds\nWaiting for the dust to settle down along the\nBack roads running through the fields\nLying on the outskirts of this lonesome town\n[Bridge 1]\nAnd I imagine sunlight in your hair\nYou're at the county fair\nYou're holding hands and laughing\nAnd now the ferris-wheel has stopped\nYou're swinging on the top\nSuspended there with him\nAnd he's the darling of the chic\nThe flavor of the week is melting\nDown your pretty summer dress\nBaby, what a mess you're making\n[Instrumental]\n[Verse 3]\nI've been stumbling through some dark places\nNow I'm following the plow\nI know I've fallen out of your good graces\nIt's alright now\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd I've been waiting in the weeds\nWaiting for the summer rain to fall upon the\nWild birds scattering the seeds\nAnswering the calling of the tide's eternal tune\n[Bridge 2]\nThe phases of the moon\nThe chambers of the heart\nThe egg and dart of small gray\nSpiders spinning in the dark\nIn spite of all the times the web is torn apart\n[Intro]\nAnd I've been waiting in the weeds\nWaiting for the time to come around again and\nHope is floating on the breeze\nCarrying my soul high up above the ground and\nI've been keeping to myself\nKnowing that the seasons are slowly changing\nEven though you're with somebody else\nHe'll never love you like I do"
