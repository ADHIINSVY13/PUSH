No!\nOh, everyday of my life\nI wanna spend it with you\nWith who...? You...!\nIt doesn't matter where we are\nOr what we do\n\nOoh, soft gentle whispers of love\nAre floating out in the air, baby\nThey say how much I love you\nAnd how much I care\nOh, love is so beautiful\nWhen I'm in your arms\nLife is wonderful\nWe've got so much love to share\nAnd I'm not going anywhere\nI'm feeling like I do\n'Cause I'm dreaming of you\nYou're not dreaming of me? Yes, I am\nDreaming of your baby\nI'm dreaming, dreaming of you, baby\nOh, love is so beautiful\nWhen I'm in your arms\nLife is wonderful\nWe've got so much love to share\nAnd I'm not going anywhere\nI'm feeling like I do\n'Cause I'm dreaming of you\nI'm dreamin', dreamin'\nDreaming of your baby\nI'm dreaming, dreaming of you, baby\n\nAnd I'm dreamin'\nDreaming of your baby\nYeah, I'm dreamin'\nDreaming of your baby\nDreamin'\nDreaming of your baby"
