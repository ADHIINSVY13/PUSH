Can I, baby?\n[Verse: Drake & \nBeyoncé\n]\nCan I\n bring you to the six where I really stay, \nbaby?\nShow you why I am the way I am\nCan I\n tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, \nbaby\n?\nI try to be consistent, but I can't\nCan I\n have an honest moment wit' you right now, \nbaby\n?\nTell me who the fuck you want to be\nCan I\n get an honest answer from you right now, \nbaby?\n'Cause all we ever talk about is me\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out\n'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be\nCan I\n call instead of text you on the hotline?\nSometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice\nCan I\n see you right now, I know the sun is up, \nbaby\n?\nSorry, I don't really have a choice\nCan I\n ever make you feel like I'm down for you, \nbaby\n?\nYou do so much more than that for me\nCan I\n finally take the time and open up to you, \nbaby\n?\n'Cause that's the side you never get to see\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out one more time\n'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be\n\n[Outro: Drake & \nBeyoncé\n]\nCan I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out\nCan I, baby? Can I, baby?\nCan I, baby? Can I, baby?\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out\nTell me who the fuck you wanna be\nCan I? Can I, baby?\nCan I, baby? Can I, baby?\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out one more time\nTell me who the fuck you wanna be\nBefore I turn the lights out"
