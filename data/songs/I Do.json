(All the way)\nAll the way (All the way)\nAll the way\nI hope we go all the way (All the way)\nI hope you do too\n[Chorus]\nI do, I do, I do, I do (Yeah)\nI hope you do too\nOh, I hope you do too (Oh, I wonder if you)\nI do, I do, I do, I do (Ayy)\nI hope you do too\nOoh, I hope you do too\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I think about every time (Time)\nThat your eyes light up like mine (Mine)\nI know I want that feeling every single night\nAm I crazy to think that you\nCould ever want it as bad as I do?\nI need it more than you could ever realize\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy don't we go all the way? (Why don't we go all the way?)\nAll the way (All the way)\nAll the way\nI hope we go all the way (All the way)\nI hope you do too\n[Chorus]\nI do, I do, I do, I do (I do)\nI hope you do too (Oh, I hope you do too)\nI hope you do too (Woah, oh, oh, ah)\nI do, I do, I do, I do (I do)\nI hope you do too (I hope you do)\nI hope you do too (I hope you do too)\n[Bridge]\nDo you, do you, do you?\n'Cause I do, I do, I do\nDo you, do you, do you?\n'Cause I do, I do, I do\n[Chorus]\nI do, I do, I do, I do (Oh, oh)\nI hope you do too\nI hope you do too (Oh, I've been wonderin' if you)\nI do, I do, I do, I do\nI hope you do too\nI hope you do too\n\n[Outro]\nWhy don't we go all the way? (Why don't we go all the way?)\nAll the way (All the way)\nAll the way\nI hope we go all the way (All the way)\nI hope you do too, ooh"
