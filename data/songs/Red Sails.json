  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI feel a little roughed up, feel a bit frightened\nNearly pin it down some time\nRed sail action, wake up in the wrong town\nBoy, I really get around\n[Refrain]\nThunder ocean, thunder ocean\nRed sails take me, make me sail along\nRed sails, and a mast so tall\nRed sails, red sails\n[Verse 2]\nDo you remember, we another person\nGreen and black and red and so scared\nGraffiti on the wall keep us all in tune\nBringing us all back home\n[Refrain]\nRed sails, thunder ocean\nRed sails, \nsailor can't dance like you\nRed sail, red sail action\nRed sail, some reaction\n[Verse 3]\nAction boy seen living under neon\nStruggle with a foreign tongue\nRed sails make him strong\nAction make him sail along\n\n[Outro]\nLife stands still and stares\nThe hinterland, the hinterland\nWe're going to sail to the hinterland\nAnd it's far far, far far far, far far far away\nIt's a far far,\n far far far, fa \nda, da da da\n1, 2, 3, 4\nOooooooh"
