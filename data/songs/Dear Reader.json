  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDear reader,\n if it feels like a trap\nYou're already in one\nDear reader, get out your map\nPick somewhere and just run\nDear reader, burn all the files\nDesert all your past lives\nAnd if you don't recognize yourself\nThat means you did it right\n[Chorus]\nNever take advice from someone who's falling apart\nNever take advice from someone who's falling apart (You should find another)\n[Verse 2]\nDear reader, bend when you can\nSnap when you have to\nDear reader, you don't have to answer\nJust 'cause they asked you\n(You should find another)\nDear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets\nDear reader, when you aim at the devil\nMake sure you don't miss\n[Chorus]\nNever take advice from someone who's falling apart\nNever take advice from someone who's falling apart\n\n[Bridge]\nSo I wander through these nights\nI prefer hiding in plain sight\nMy fourth drink in my hand\nThese desperate prayers of a cursed man\nSpilling out to you for free\nBut darling, darling, please\nYou wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking\nIf you knew where I was walking\nTo a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there\nWhere I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care\nNo one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire\n[Outro]\nYou should find another guiding light, guiding light\nBut I shine so bright\nYou should find another guiding light, guiding light\nBut I shine so bright\nYou should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)\nFind another, you should find another\nYou should find another"
