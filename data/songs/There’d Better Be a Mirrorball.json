  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDon't get emotional, that ain't like you\nYesterday's still leaking through the roof\nThat's nothing new\nI know I promised this is what I wouldn't do\nSomehow giving it the old romantic fool\nSeems to better suit the mood\n[Chorus]\nSo if you wanna walk me to the car\nYou oughta know I'll have a heavy heart\nSo can we please be absolutely sure\nThat there's a mirrorball?\n[Verse 2]\nYou're getting cynical and that won't do\nI'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view\nDarling, if I were you\nAnd how's that insatiable appetite?\nFor the moment whеn you look them in the eyеs\nAnd say, \"Baby, it's been nice\"\n[Chorus]\nSo do you wanna walk me to the car?\nI'm sure to have a heavy heart\nSo can we please be absolutely sure\nThat there's a mirrorball for me?\nOh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me"
