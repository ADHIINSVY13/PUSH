  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Pouya]\nThey say to live in the present but at the moment I'm stressing\nToo many pressure building situations I've been dealing with daily\nBut still, I find a way to swerve in and out that bullshit\nGotta keep my pockets fat and always have my chin up\nI know these rappers waiting for me to slip up, know they can't beat me\nGet your money right before you see me, or leave me to be\nI'm in way too deep, won't be no backstrokes\nBitch, don't fuck up my cashflow\nI'm trynna emulate Warren Buffett with the real estate\nToo many so-called friends\nHow do I know? Why can't I see who there for me?\nAm I the man that I was always meant to be\nThis life is tough, everybody chasing nuts\nEnough is never enough, yuh\n[Interlude: Lu baby]\nBitch, give me my money\nWoah, woah, woah, woah\n[Verse 2: Lu baby]\nPussy boy, I'm a singer, I do not yell\nI just put my hands on that boy and he fell\nMy baby mama mad 'cause they blowin' up my cell\nThey don't know who they fucking with, I'm straight outta hell\nYour girl got her fingers on me like some braille (Oh she touchy, touchy)\nWatch that bitch buckle, I'm under that belt (Oh she touchy, touchy)\nLu baby like a Cupid, baby girl, can't you tell?\nOnly got one life, little boy, get out your shell, hey\n\n[Outro: Lu baby]\nI might love you now\nBut I might change my mind\nI might change my mind (Yeah, uh)\nI might take my life next time\nNow get in line (Tell 'em)\nNow get in line (Lu baby, yeah)"
