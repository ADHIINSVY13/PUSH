  "lyrics": "From the highest tower, I will call you home\nIt's the same old story, love will find it's own\nYou come to me, conspiracy of the night\nThe heart that you want just happens to be mine\nThieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains\nBut you wind up on my side, and what will be will be\nThat you wear a disguise, the epitome of deceit\nThe face of a friend invisible on the street\nIf you're battling to be mine, I'm victorious in defeat\nAnd I surrender, I surrender\nAnybody want me, anyone know my name\nDo it in a lifetime, you be dust and the soul survives\nEvens up the score\nFrom the highest tower, I will call you home\nIt's the same old story, love will find it's own\nAnd I surrender, take me for all time\nLove that lasts forever, I surrender\nWe are elite, prisoners of the night\nWe fight to the finish and savour the delights\nIt's your body that got me beat, and I'm crumbling at your feet\nI surrender, I surrender\n\nYou're the air that I breathe\nI will walk through fire, keep you safe and sound\nIn the final hour, turn my life around\nAnd I surrender, take me for all time\nYou're the air that I breathe\nThis is my life story, I've been lost and found\nIn the final hour, turn my life around\nAnd I surrender. take me for all time\nLove as warm as wine, and I surrender\nTake me for all time, love that lasts forever"
