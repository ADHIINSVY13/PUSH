  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEverything I want, I have\nMoney, notoriety and rivieras\nI even think I found God\nIn the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras\nPretty cameras, pretty cameras\nAm I glamorous? Tell me, am I glamorous?\n[Chorus]\nHello? Hello? Ca-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you wanna see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all\nI have nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\n[Verse 2]\nSummertime is nice and hot\nAnd my life is sweet like vanilla is\nGold and silver-lined, my heart\nBut burned into my brain, all these stolen images\nStolen images, baby, stolen images\nCan you picture it, babe, that life we could've lived?\n[Chorus]\nHello? Hello? Ca-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you like to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all\nI have nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\n\n[Bridge]\nWe were two kids just tryin' to get out\nLived on the dark side of the American dream\nWe would dance all night, play our music loud\nWhen we grew up, nothing was what it seemed\n[Chorus]\nHello? Hello? Ca-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you like to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all\nI have nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\nHello? Hello? Ca-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you like to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all\nI have nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\n[Outro]\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing if I can't have you"
