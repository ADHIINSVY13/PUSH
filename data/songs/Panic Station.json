  "lyrics": "Another single from The 2nd Law. Very funky, with hooks full of falsetto. The theme of the song is you need to go and achieve your dreams, no matter how hard it is.\n[Verse 1]\nYou won't get much closer 'til you sacrifice it all (All)\nYou won't get to taste it with your face against the wall (Wall, wall)\nGet up and commit, \nshow the power trapped within (–In, –in)\nDo just what you want to\n and now stand up and begin, uh\n[Chorus]\nOooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes\nAnd this chaos, it defies imagination\nOooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives\nYou've arrived at panic station\n[Verse 2]\nDoubts will try to break you, unleash your heart and soul (Soul)\nTrouble will surround you, start taking some control (–trol!)\nStand up and deliver your wildest fantasy (–sy, –sy)\nDo what the fuck you want to, there's no one to appea-ea-ease\n[Chorus]\nOooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes\nAnd this chaos, it defies imagination\nOooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives\nYou've arrived at panic station\n[Interlude]\nWaahoh!\nHey!\nUuh!\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Outro]\nOooh-aaah, oooh-aaah\nOooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes\nAnd this chaos, it defies imagination\nOooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives\nAnd I know that you will fight for the duration\nOooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes\nAnd I know I'm not resisting your temptations\nOooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives\nYou've arrived at panic station\nWoow!\nWoo! Ugh!"
