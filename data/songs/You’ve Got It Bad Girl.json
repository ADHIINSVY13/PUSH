  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen you believe in a feeling\nThat's holding you back from my love\nThen you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl\nWhen you insist on excluding\nThe tenderness that's in my kiss\nThen you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl\n[Bridge]\nIf you try to display an emotion that will contradict itself\nYou will find your heart just sitting\nLike a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf\n[Verse 2]\nShould you depend on an outlet\nThrough which an escape can be found\nThen you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl\nIf you don't see there's no way out\nJust no way of getting 'round me\nThen you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl\n[Bridge]\nYes, you know the plans I am making are intended to capture you\nSo you practice false reaction\nTo delay the things I do, the things I do, things I do\nOh foolish you\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)\nYou've got it bad girl (You've got it bad girl)\nMmm hmm, yeah yeah\nYou've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)\nYou've got it bad girl (You've got it bad)\n[Bridge]\nThere's no reward in detouring, my deep sincerity\nEspecially since what you're feeling\nIs perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me\n[Verse 4]\nBefore you discover the feeling\nYou've tried very hard to hide\nThen you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl\nBut when you can find just a small space\nTo let my love live in your mind\nThen you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl\n[Outro]\nYou'll have it good girl (You'll have it good girl)\nYou'll have it good girl (You'll have it good)\nYou'll have it good girl\n(You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good girl)\nYou'll have it good girl\nYou'll have it good girl (You'll have it good, you'll have it good)\nYou'll have it good girl\n(You'll have it good, you'll have it good, you'll have it good)\nYou'll have it good girl (Baby baby)\nYou'll have it good girl\nYou'll have it good girl"
