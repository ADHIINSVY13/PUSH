  "lyrics": "Autumn and Friday the winds blew\nJuly, September, I knew you\nAnd now I sit on the sand hill\nI sing our song to the sea\nAugust, October\nMid-April, November, May\nBeckoning hands made you fly\nI cry, it's curtains today\nIn August, October the grass grew\nThe sky was blue and I want you\nNow as I look out my window\nI see the world carry on\nAugust, October\nMid-April, November, May\nBeckoning hands made you fly\nI cry, it's curtains today\nAugust, October\nMid-April, November, May\nBeckoning hands made you fly\nI cry, it's curtains today"
