  "lyrics": "It's very clear, our love is here to stay\nNot for a year, but ever and a day\nThe radio and the telephone and the movies that we know\nMay just be passing fancies and in time, may go\nBut oh, my dear, our love is here to stay\nTogether we're goin' a long, long way\nIn time, the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble\nThey're only made of clay\nBut our love is here to stay\nThe radio and the telephone and the movies that we know\nMay just be passing fancies, and in time, they go\nBut oh my dear, love is here to stay\nTogether we're goin' a long, long way\nIn time, the Rockies may crumble and Gibraltar, it may tumble\nThey're only made of clay\nBut our love, our love is here to stay"
