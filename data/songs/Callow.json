  "lyrics": "Hold your tongue, we never swayed\nPour the faults all away\nCold in lungs and in face\nA golden heart, of what became?\nIt was an awful lot for our young days\nIs it love you want? 'Cus it's love you've made\nThe cheer within will find a home\nThe fear you bring burns below\nAnd I can taste the wait and watch you waste away\nBut I can't face the days, you were born astray\nIt was an awful lot for our young days\nAnd what an ache I've made for a hollow embrace\nWith the blood you flaunt, why would you stay?\nI'm stackin' up on what I'll take\nBut the ballot doesn't hold your name\nYou're wrapping up when winter fades\nI'm holding on the callow ways\nIt was an awful lot for our young days"
