  "lyrics": "Well first you gotta wanna get off bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place\nAnd you better trust in your lady luck\nPray to God that she don't give up on you right now\nLive fast die young bull rider\nOne hand hold is all you got it's you and the bull against the clock and a cross crowd\nAnd once upon a spinnin' ton nothin' else you've ever done can pull this way\nYou're just outside the buckin' shoot\nLose a spur you lose your seat and you lose yourself\nBy now he's buckin' mean and dirty\nSlingin' mud and cowboy boots and kickin' clowns\nNo fools no fun bull rider\nYou gotta feel the way he's movin' you gotta watch his head\nAnd brace yourself for anything that a friend of you might dead\nYou know the art of hangin' loose hangin' just as tight\nWell there's something like a hurricane who's dancin' with the kite\nLive fast die young bull rider\nWell the rodeo is more than rough\nIt's a fact of life it's tough to cut his fever ass\n\nIt's drinkin' beer and pullin' trailers\nTighten may on barreled razors and horse's buck\nNo fools no fun bull rider\nLive fast die young bull rider"
