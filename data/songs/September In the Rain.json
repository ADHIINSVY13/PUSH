  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe leaves of brown came tumbling down\nRemember in September in the rain\nThe Sun went out just like a dying amber\nThat September in the rain\n[Chorus]\nTo every word of love I heard you whisper\nThe raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain\nThough spring is here to me it's still September\nThat September in the rain\n[Chorus]\nTo every word of love I heard you whisper\nThe raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain\nThough spring is here to me it is still September\nThat September in the rain\n[Outro]\nThat September that brought the pain\nThat September in the rain"
