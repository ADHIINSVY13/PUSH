  "lyrics": "“Surefire” is the seventh song off Darkness and Light which finds John Legend singing about a feeling he has that tells him his relationship is meant to be and what they can accomplish together.\n[Verse 1]\nCan you just stay through the night?\nTurn down the bed and the blinds\nBefore you turn around\nCan you just stay through the night?\nLet me breathe you in 'til gravity bends\nAnd we fall through the hole in the light\nMake this our kingdom\nSomewhere where good love conquers and not divides\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I may not know a lot of things but\nI feel it in my chest\nKnow I won't let the blue flame die\nWe can't lose hope just yet\n'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime\nAnd we're scared to love but it's alright\nI may not know a lot of things but\nI know that we're surefire, yeah\nKnow that we're surefire, yeah\n[Verse 2]\nCan't keep this bed warm on the left side\nWhen something is cold as a goodbye\nWhy don't you turn around?\nIgnore all that shit from the outside\nThe world is a nightmare\nWake up and stay here\nLet me be on your side\nWe'll make this our kingdom\nSomewhere where good love conquers and not divides\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting\nLet go, give in, let go and give up, oh\n[Chorus]\nI may not know a lot of things but\nI feel it in my chest\nKnow I won't let the blue flame die\nWe can't lose hope just yet\n'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime\nAnd we're scared to love but it's alright\nI may not know a lot of things but\nI know that we're surefire\nKnow that we're surefire\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting\nLet go, give in, let go and give up, oh\n[Chorus]\nI may not know a lot of things but\nI feel it in my chest\nIf we just let the blue flame die\nThe devil wins this bet\nOh it's once, just once in a lifetime\nAnd you're scared to love but it's alright\nI may not know a lot of things but\nI know that we're surefire\nKnow that we're surefire"
