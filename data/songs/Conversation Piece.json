  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI took this walk to ease my mind\nTo find out what's gnawing at me\nWouldn't think to look at me\nThat I've spent a lot of time in education\nIt all seems so long ago\nI'm a thinker, not a talker\nI've no-one to talk to anyway\n[Chorus]\nI can't see the road\nFor the rain in my eyes\nAhh-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah\n[Verse 2]\nI live above the grocer's store\nOwned by an Austrian\nHe often calls me down to eat\nAnd he jokes about his broken English\nTries to be a friend to me\nBut for all my years of reading conversation\nI stand without a word to say\n[Chorus]\nI can't see the bridge\nFor the rain in my eyes\nAh-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd the world is full of life\nFull of folk who don't know me\nAnd they walk in twos or threes or more\nWhile the lamp that shines above the grocers' store\nInvestigates my face so rudely\nAnd my essays lying scattered on the floor\nFulfill their needs just by being there\n[Bridge]\nAnd my hands shake, my head hurts\nMy voice sticks inside my throat\nI'm invisible and dumb\nAnd no-one will recall me\n[Chorus]\nAnd I can't see the water\nFor the tears in my eyes"
