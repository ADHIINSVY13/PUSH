  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI recall how we lived\nOn the corner of a bed, and\nAnd we'd speak of a Swedish room\nOf hessian and wood\n[Verse 2]\nAnd we'd talk with our eyes\nOf the sweetness in our lives\nAnd tomorrows of rich surprise\nSome things we could do\n[Chorus]\nIn our madness\nWe burnt one hundred days\nTime takes time to pass\nAnd I still hold some ashes\nTo me\nAn occasional dream\n[Verse 3]\nAnd we'd sleep, oh-so close\nBut not really close our eyes\nBetween the sheets of summer, bathed in blue\nGently weeping nights\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt was long, long ago; long ago (long ago)\nAnd I still can't touch your name\nFor the days of fate were strong for you\nDanced you far from me\n[Chorus]\nIn my madness\nI see your face in mine\nI keep a photograph\nIt burns my wall with time\nTime\nAn occasional dream\nOf mine\nAn occasional dream\nOf mine\nAn occasional dream (Dream!)\nOf mine!"
