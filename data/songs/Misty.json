(Awoo-)\nOn my own (baby)\nWhen I wander through this wonderland, I- I can't make it alone, honey\nNever knowing my right foot from my left, Lord\nMy hat from my glove\nI get misty, I get misty\nI get misty, gettin' too much in love\nWoah Lord I'm in love, ooh and I get misty\nGot smoke in my eyes I can't see a lick\nI get misty, I'm so misty\nI'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love"
