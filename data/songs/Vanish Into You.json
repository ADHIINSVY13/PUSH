Do you see me now?\nI've been waiting for you, cryin' out\nDo you see me? Do you see me now?\n[Chorus]\nSaw your face and mine\nIn a picture by our bedside\nIt was cold in the summertime\nWe were happy just to be alive\nCan I vanish into you?\nCan I vanish into you? (Yah)\n[Verse 2]\nInto the night, we fly\nSirens blow by our heads (Yah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you see me? Do you see me now?\nI've been waiting for you, cryin' out\nDo you see me? Do you see me now?\n[Chorus]\nSaw your face and mine\nIn a picture by our bedside\nIt was cold in the summertime\nWe were happy just to be alive\nCan I vanish into you?\nCan I vanish into you?\n[Instrumental Break]\n(Yah)\n[Chorus]\nSaw your face and mine\nIn a picture by, by, by, by my bedside\nIt was cold in the summertime\nWe were happy just to be alive\nCan I, I vanish into you?\nCan I vanish into you? (Can I? Can I?)\nLike a ghost, I, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, vanish into you\nCan I vanish into you?\n\n[Outro]\nWhen I die, can I vanish into you\n?"
