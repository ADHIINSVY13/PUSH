Yeah\nYou say the gold never fades away\nI’d trade the gold for you any day\nWhat does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don’t need the pretty lights\nNo recognition for tonight\nI, I just wanna live my life, oh\nCalling out my fuckin’ name\nI’m a human, yes I say\nI’m the same way as I came, oh\n[Chorus]\nI want you to love me, I want you to love me\nIf I had no-nothing no more\nWould you say that you love me\nSay that you love me?\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I, I wanna go in deep\nShow you what’s underneath\nWhat does it mean, what does it mean? Yeah\nSo I am giving you all of me\nWhat you get now is what you see\nThat’s what I mean, that’s what I mean, yeah\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don’t need the pretty lights\nNo recognition for tonight\nI, I just wanna live my life, oh\nCalling out my fuckin’ name\nI’m a human, yes I say\nI’m the same way as I came, oh\n[Chorus]\nI want you to love me, I want you to love me\nIf I had no-nothing no more\nWould you say that you love me\nSay that you love me?\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more\n\n[Bridge]\nTell me, tell me, tell me what you see\nTell me is it you or is it me?\nIf I got you, you know that I don’t need\nNothing, nothing, nothing no more\nTell me, tell me, tell me what you see\nTell me is it you or is it me?\nIf I got you, you know that I don’t need\nNothing, nothing, nothing no more\n[Chorus]\nI want you to love me, I want you to love me\nIf I had no-nothing no more\nWould you say that you love me\nSay that you love me?\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more (Oh)\nIf I had no-nothing no more"
