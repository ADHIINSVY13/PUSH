I can't explain this shit\nMechanic's brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it\nBut I can show you the ropes 'til you get the hang of it\nElephantiasis of the nuts, element\nOf Intelligent Hoodlum, Arrested Development\nCella Dwellas and Wise Intelligent, since elementary\nThrough Hell I went, accelerant from lack of melanin\nFailin' in school, smart aleck wit\nHelped me to rebel against shit so well and vent\nSo eloquently, yet, I was irrelevant\nSoon as I quit givin' a fuck, I started to sell a bit\nNow let's travel inside the mind of a hater\n'Cause I don't see no fans, all I see's a bunch of complainers\n\"Kendrick's album was cool, but it didn't have any bangers\nWayne's album or Ye's, couldn't tell you which one was lamer\nJoyner's album was corny, Shady's new shit is way worse\nEverything is either too tame or there's too much anger\nI didn't like the beat, so I hated \nMight Delete Later\n\"\nYou nerdy pricks would find somethin' wrong with \n36 Chambers\nIt's what they do to the greats\nPick apart a Picasso and make excuses to hate\nSo you can wait for your flowers until you're blue in the face\nStupid, you ain't gonna get 'em until your funeral wake (\nHm\n)"
