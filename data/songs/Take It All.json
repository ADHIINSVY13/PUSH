  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDidn't I give it all? Tried my best\nGave you everything I had, everything and no less\nDidn't I do it right? Did I let you down?\nMaybe you got too used to, well, having me around\nStill, how can you walk away from all my tears?\nIt's gonna be an empty road without me right here\n[Chorus]\nBut go on and take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe I should leave to help you see\nNothing gets better than this\nAnd this is everything we need\nSo is it over? Is this really it?\nYou're giving up so easily\nI thought you loved me more than this\n[Chorus]\nBut go on, go on and take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\n\n[Bridge]\nI will change if I must\nSlow it down and bring it home, I will adjust\nOh, if only, if only you knew\nThat everything I do is for you\n[Chorus]\nBut go on, go on and take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\nTake it all with my love"
