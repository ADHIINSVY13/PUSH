Nah\nPregnant pause, give you some second thoughts\nThere's room on the bandwagon, don't abort\nMarcy me\n\n[Verse 2: JAY-Z]\nMarcy me\nStreets is my artery, the vein of my existence\nI'm the Gotham City heartbeat\nI started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis\nI'm a Sufi to goofies, I could prolly speak Farsi\nThat's poetry,\n \nreek of coca leaf in my past\nCame through the bushes smellin' like roses\nI need a trophy just for that\nOld Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof\nFat laces in your shoe,\n \nI'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh\nHold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke\nY'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope\nShout out to all the murderers turned murals\nPlural, fuck the Federal Bureau\nShout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle\nAll the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile\nShout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes\nThus concludin' my concerto\nMarcy me\n[Outro: The-Dream]\nMust be in the air\nOh, can't walk away, I know, I know\nJust the way I'm raised\nI know, I know, I know\nOh Marcy, Marcy me\nJust the way I am always gonna be\nI ain't gonna change, no\nMarcy, Marcy me, just the way I am\nI ain't gonna change, no\nI ain't gonna change, no\n \n(\nComo hás nome, cavaleiro?\n)\nCouldn't change me if I wanted to \n(\nEu hei nome Todo o Mundo\n)\nYou couldn't change me if you wanted to \n(\nE meu tempo\n)\nI'ma take this with me to the moon"
