  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhy do I do just as you say?\nWhy must I just give you your way?\nWhy do I sigh?\nWhy don't I try to forget?\nIt must have been that something lovers call fate\nKept me saying, \"I had to wait\"\nI saw them all\nJust couldn't fall 'til we met\n[Chorus]\nIt had to be you\nIt had to be you\nI wandered around and I finally found\nThe somebody who\nCould make me be true\nAnd could make me be blue\nAnd even be glad just to be sad thinking of you\n[Verse 2]\nSome others I've seen\nMight never be mean\nMight never be cross or try to be boss\nBut they wouldn't do\nFor nobody else gave me a thrill\nWith all your faults, I love you still\nIt had to be you, wonderful you\nIt had to be you\n\n[Outro]\nFor nobody else gave me a thrill\nWith all your faults, I love you still\nIt had to be you, wonderful you\nIt had to be you"
