'Cause in a sense, see, we all be kind of fly\nJust can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things\nMaybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing\nKeeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring\nWe like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring\nExtraterrestrial, out of this world\n\n[Hook: Witchdoctor]\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world"
