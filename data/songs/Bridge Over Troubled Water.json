  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen you're weary\nAnd feeling small\nWhen tears are in your eyes\nI will dry them all\nI'm on your side\nOh, when times get rough\nAnd friends just can't, can't be found\n[Chorus]\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down, yeah\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you're down and out\nOr when you're on the street\nWhen evening falls so hard\nI will comfort you\nI'll take your part\nOh, when darkness comes\nAnd pain is all, all around\n[Chorus]\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down, hey, hey\n\n[Verse 3]\nSail on, silver girl, yeah\nSail on by\nYour time has come to shine\nAll your dreams are on their way\nSee how they shine\nAnd if you ever need a friend\nLook around, I'm sailing right, right behind\n[Chorus]\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will ease your mind\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\n[Outro]\nHey, hey, hey\nI will lay me down"
