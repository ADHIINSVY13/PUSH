Now, he needs to convince her to come back.\n[Intro]\nOne, two, three\n[Verse 1]\nUnhappy days\nThat left us on the floor\nAnd you squeeze me\nTill you're not feeling sure\nEverything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll\nTake you along the pier\nEverything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll\nMake things disappear\n, dear\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDarling don't be nervous\nI'll understand if you let me go\nI did this on purpose\nNow\n, 'cause when I'm missing you\n[Chorus 1]\nI'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress\nSo I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness\nAnd why you're leaving too\n, maybe I'll put you to a test\nAnd say that I love you, I think that I love you\n[Verse 2]\nSunny days\nThat left my skin dark red\nAnd you breathe me\nTill these thoughts leave my head\nIf it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;\nCan you see what's wrong?\nIf you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;\nSee what's going on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd darling don't be nervous\nI'll understand if you let me go\nI did this on purpose\nNow\n, 'cause when I'm missing you\n[Chorus 1]\nI'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress\nSo I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness\nAnd why you're leaving too\n, maybe I'll put you to a test\nAnd say that I love you, I think that I love you\n[Bridge]\nTake me back to live at home\nTake me back to Albert Road\n[Chorus 2]\n'Cause when I'm missing you\nI'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress\nSo I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness\nAnd why you left too\n, I thought I’d put you to a test\nAnd say that I love you, I think that I love you\nAnd I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress\nSo I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness\nAnd why you left me too, I thought I’d put you to a test\nAnd say that I love you, now it seems you loved me too"
