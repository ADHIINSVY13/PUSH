  "lyrics": "[Segue: Intro]\nHe's a fairy feller\n[Verse 1]\nAh, ah, the fairy folk have gathered ‘round the new-moon shine\nTo see the feller crack a nut\n at night's noon-time\nTo swing his axe he swears\nAs he climbs he dares\nTo deliver (The master-stroke)\n[Verse 2]\nPloughman, \"Waggoner Will\", and types\nPolitician with senatorial pipe\nHe's a dilly-dally-o\nPedagogue squinting, wears a frown\nAnd a satyr peers under lady's gown\nDirty fellow, what a dirty laddio\nTatterdemalion and a junketer\nThere's a thief\n and a dragonfly trumpeter\nHe's my hero (Aaaaah!)\n[Refrain]\nFairy dandy tickling the fancy\nOf his lady friend\nThe nymph in yellow\n(Can we see the master-stroke)\nWhat a quaere fellow\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Bridge]\nSoldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy\nWaiting to hear the sound\nAnd the arch-magician presides\nHe is the leader\n[Verse 3]\nOberon and Titania\nWatched by a harridan\nMab is the queen\nAnd there's a good apothecary man\nCome to say hello\n[Refrain]\nFairy dandy tickling the fancy\nOf his lady friend\nThe nymph in yellow\nWhat a quaere fellow\n[Outro]\nThe ostler stares\nWith hands on his knees\nCome on, Mr. Feller\nCrack it open if you please\n\n[Transition into Nevermore]"
