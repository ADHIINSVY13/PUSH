  "lyrics": "Perhaps, Lady Gaga stated something just in the intro speech of her official Marry The Night music video.\n\nWatch the speech here:\n\"The Prelude Pathétique\"- First Part:\nWhen I look back on my life it’s not that I don’t want to see things exactly as they happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. \nAnd truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it\n. \nClinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever.\n It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality\nFor example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I\n. \nAnd the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti\n. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, \nand I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring\nCheck out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam\nThe truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears\n\"The Prelude Pathétique\"- Last Part:\nYou may say \"I lost everything\".\n But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; \nI did it all over again"
