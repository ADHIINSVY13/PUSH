Ayy\n[Chorus: Logic]\nWho got the juice like me?\nWho got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)\nI'm finna give her the D\nEnd of the night, she gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)\nWho sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?\nWho's biracial only in his penis? (Bobby)\nMy shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius\nSelf-proclaimed, but they know the name (Bobby)\nWho got the juice like me?\nWho got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)\nI'm finna give her the D\nEnd of the night, she gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)\nWho sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?\nWho's biracial only in his penis? (Bobby)\nMy shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius\nSelf-proclaimed, but they know the name (Bobby)\n\n[Verse: Logic]\nI guess when you make it this big\nPeople assume your head this big (Bobby)\nStart takin' shots, yeah, they pull the trig\nIn person, they blow smoke like a cig\nShorty gon' pass me the head 'til I nut\nI am so rich that I don't give a fuck\nMe and my homies, we smoke in the cut\nMomberg, like what?\nI just performed for like fifteen thousand\nI leave these women arousin'\nAll the pussy in the club make a tidal wave\nCome on, now, Bobby boy, behave\nBlack and white, you ain't half of the nigga I am\nYou just mad you ain't as big as I am\nReal MC, your shit Sam-I-Am\nBeen a while, can I get a \"God damn\"?\nI am the best in my field like a slave\nWho said fuck emancipation, burned the plantation\nFacing death, and then put the master in his grave\nWhy? 'Cause black is beautiful\nSnappin' so hard, I might snap a cuticle\nFifty million in the bank\nKnow my circle like a tank\nThink you can get in, you can't\nKiss a bitch hand and she faint\nKiss a bitch hand and she faint\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nWho got the juice like me?\nWho got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)\nI'm finna give her the D\nEnd of the night, she gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)\nWho sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?\nWho's biracial only in his penis? (Bobby)\nMy shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius\nSelf-proclaimed, but they know the name (Bobby)\nWho got the juice like me?\nWho got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)\nI'm finna give her the D\nEnd of the night, she gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)\nWho sell out arenas? Who spit it the meanest?\nWho's biracial only in his penis? (Bobby)\nMy shit the cleanest, I'm a fuckin' genius\nSelf-proclaimed, but they know the name (Bobby)\n[Outro: Smokey Legendary]\nMan, you know, he don't fuck with nobody\nYou know why?\n'Cause all y'all niggas is talkin' a bunch of bullshit\nAnd you know, you can't back up what ya say\nBecause your mouth say one thing\nAnd your actions show another\nThen you can't back it up\nSo what the fuck you gon' do?\nThis is Logic's dad, this is Bobby Smokey Hall\nAnd he came out my balls (Bobby)"
