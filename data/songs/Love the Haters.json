I say heck no\"\nHow about some awesome techno?\n\n[Verse 4: Madison Hu & \nOlivia Rodrigo\n]\nSo what do you think? Have we gotten greater?\nThis guy says, \"Girls stink\"\nWe're dudes now\n[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu, \nMadison Hu\n]\nYou've gotta love the haters (\nGotta love the haters\n)\nYou've gotta love the haters\nYou've gotta love the haters\nYou've gotta love the haters\nYou've gotta love the haters"
