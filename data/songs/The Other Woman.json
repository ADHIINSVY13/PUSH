  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe other woman has time to manicure her nails\nThe other woman is perfect where her rival fails\nAnd she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere\nThe other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume\nThe other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room\nAnd there are never toys that's scattered everywhere\n[Bridge]\nAnd when her old man comes to call\nHe finds her waitin' like a lonesome queen\n'Cause to be by her side\nIt's such a change from old routine\nBut\n[Verse 2]\nThe other woman will always cry herself to sleep\nThe other woman will never have his love to keep\nAnd as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone\n[Outro]\nAlone\nBaby, do-do\nAh, ah, ah, ah\nAh, ah\nOoh\nAlone"
