  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI take a step outside and I breathe the air\nAnd I slam the door and I'm on my way\nI won't lay no blame, I won't call you names\n'Cause I've made my break and I won't look back\nI've turned my back on those endless games\n[Verse 2]\nI'm all through with ties, I'm all tired of tears\nI'm a happy man, don't it look that way?\nShaking dust from my shoes, there's a road ahead\nAnd there's no way back home (No way back home)\nOh, but I have to say\n[Chorus]\nLeaving home ain’t easy\nOh, I never thought it would be easy\nLeaving on your own\nOh, there's a million things a-calling me back\nLeaving home ain’t easy\nOn the one you're leaving home\n[Bridge]\nStay, my love\nMy love, please stay\nDon't stray, my love\nWhat's wrong, my love?\nWhat's right, my love?\n\n[Chorus]\nLeaving home ain’t easy\nMy God, how could I think of leaving?\nLeaving on your own\nStill trying to persuade me that\nLeaving home ain’t necessarily the only way\n[Outro]\nLeaving home ain’t easy\nBut may be the only way"
