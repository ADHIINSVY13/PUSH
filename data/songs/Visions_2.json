  "lyrics": "This the second track off of his critically acclaimed album, “Innervisions”.\n\n\n\nStevie Wonder talks about an ideal society where we are not only at peace with others but also with ourselves.\n[Verse 1]\nPeople hand in hand\nHave I lived to see the milk and honey land?\nWhere hate's a dream and love forever stands\nOr is this a \nvision in my mind\n?\n[Verse 2]\nThe law was never passed\nBut somehow all men feel they are truly free at last\nHave we really gone this far through space and time\nOr is this a vision in my mind?\n[Bridge]\nI'm not one who make believes\nI know that leaves are green\nThey only turn to brown when autumn comes around\nI know just what I say\nToday's not yesterday\nAnd all things have an ending\n[Verse 3]\nBut what I'd like to know\nIs could a place like this exist so beautiful?\nOr do we have to find our wings and fly away\nTo the vision in our mind?\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm not one who make believes\nI know that leaves are green\nThey only change to brown when autumn comes around\nI know just what I say\nToday's not yesterday\nAnd all things have an ending\n[Verse 3]\nBut what I'd like to know\nIs could a place like this exist so beautiful?\nOr do we have to take our wings and fly away\nTo the visions in our minds?"
