Why not? My music's all that I got\nBut some time must be invested for this to be manifested\nI know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I\nGet high but I don't get too high\nSo what's the limit 'posed to be?\nThat must be why you can't get yourself up out the bed before three\nYou need to git up, git out, cut that bull out\nAin't you sick and tired of having to do without?\nDamn, what up with all these questions?\nYou act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?\n'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning\nSick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning\nBut I'm also sick and tired of struggling\nI never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling\nNaw, that ain't what I'm about\nCee-Lo will just continue traveling his route\nWithout any doubt or fear\nI know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here\nDid I make myself clear?\n\n[Chorus: Cee-Lo]\nYou got to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\n'Cause you and I got to do for you and I\nThat's why\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWell, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you pinhead?\nSee, when I was a youngster, used to wear them country Pro Keds\nMy mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart\nTold me to jack them weak suckers for they hooded Starters\nIn the middle school, I was a bigger fool\nI wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool\nI used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles\nThey taught me (They taught me), I followed them when they ran numbers\nSo in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby\nAnd then I learned the difference between a trick and a lady\nHell, I treat 'em all like those, see I pimped 'em\nWitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em\nSee, all the playas came and all the playas went\nA playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his business\nYou need to git up, git out, git something\nSmoke out cause it's all about money, money, money\nYeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat\nI hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy\nI'm true to Organized cause they raised me\nI'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A.
