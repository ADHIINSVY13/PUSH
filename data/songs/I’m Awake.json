  "lyrics": "Remember when I lost control? I lost my soul\nI'm finally awake\nThere were times when I lost my mind, but now I'm fine\nI'm finally awake\nStuck in your sadness, swallowed me away\nBut I'm finally awake\nThe thumping in the walls is the beat of my own heart\nBut I'm finally awake\nNow I'm finally awake\nHow do you know what is real?\nWhen it rains, it bleeds, when it bleeds, it pours\nBut I'm finally awake\nYou pushed me in the moment I deserved\nBut I'm finally awake\nNow I'm finally awake\nNow heaven looks like a fancy restaurant\nAnd I'm finally awake\nHow do you know what is rеal?\nNow I'm finally awake\nFly your kite all your life\nDon't lеt go, it'll be alright\nFly your kite all your life\nDon't let go, it'll be alright, it'll be alright\nFly your kite all your life\nDon't let go, it will be alright\nFly your kite all your life\nDon't let go, it'll be alright, it'll be alright\nFly your kite all your life\nDon't let go, it'll be alright\nFly your kite all your life\nDon't let go, it'll be alright, it'll be alright"
