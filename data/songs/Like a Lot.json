Takin' notes (Takin' notes)\nCall you papa when you stroke\nCall you captain, take the boat (Take the boat)\nDon't wanna rock or make it float (Make it float)\nWhen you crack or take the joke\nGuys on top will make you ghost\nEyes roll back and make your toes curl (Toes curl)\nSee, you just talking with the wrong girl\n[Chorus]\nMake him never wanna go\nGotta keep him wantin' more\nI just wanna do the things you like a lot\nLike a lot, like a lot, like a lot, babe\nMake him never wanna go\nGotta keep him wantin' more\nI just wanna do the things you like a lot\nLike a lot, like a lot, like a lot, babe\n\n[Open verse]\n[Chorus]\nMake him never wanna go\nGotta keep him wantin' more\nI just wanna do the things you like a lot\nLike a lot, like a lot, like a lot, babe\nMake him never wanna go\nGotta keep him wantin' more\nI just wanna do the things you like a lot\nLike a lot, like a lot, like a lot, babe"
