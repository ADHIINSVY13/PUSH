  "lyrics": "If you're lonely in the black of night\nIf you call me, I'll be there\nI was falling and you helped me get it right\nAnd I thank you girl, and I thank you\nAnd I pray for the sign\nAnd I won't be too late\nIf you just come down\nI can look you in the eye\nI can tell you that I love you\nAnd my love will never die\nAnd it's time that you know\nJust how far I mean to go\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nCome tomorrow, candle burns\nAnd I wake up by your side\nAll my sorrow, you made it disappear\nAnd I thank you, and I thank you\nAnd I lay down my life\nAnd I won't be alone\n\nIf you just take time\nAnd be sure of who you are\nWe can take it up to heaven\nWe can walk amongst the stars\nAnd I know if you stay\nI will never turn away\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nAnd I pray for the sign\nAnd I won't be too late\nIf you just take time\nAnd be sure of who you are\nWe can take it up to heaven\nWe can walk amongst the stars\nAnd I know if you stay\nI will never turn away\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon\nWe fly rings around the moon"
