  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm sticking ice picks on the tip of your dick\nGive your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?\nAm I hard hardcore? Harder than the Plymouth\nIt ain't no myth, it's a nigga with a spliff\nAnd a chrome four fifth pressed on your back\nSo what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?\nI hope civilized 'cause I love to see niggas die\nBrains all leaking out on the street\nAnd the pastor preaching, \"He was a good man.\"\nPlayed the bad man when the burner was in his hand\nNow he's singing sad songs with Elvis\nThree to the head, 'bout six 'cross the pelvis\nYou fuck with the high guy, you die\nYou're the same motherfucker kicking, \"Look up in the sky!\"\nI'm on some old neck shit, suplex shit\nHardcore sex shit and TEC shit\n[Chorus]\nWhatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\n\n[Verse 2]\nA repetitive loop all I need to destroy\nA soloist or group, huh, I put it to you boy\nHope you got the scoop, Biggie Smalls, the rap genius\nI keep the Glock by the penis\nThe cleanest cut, fuck sluts with the big humongous butts\nHuh, I use a rubber, but\nMy style is gushy like the hooker's pussy\nAnd it don't take a lot of backtalk to push me\nInto flaming 'em like that little nigga Damien\nGlock 19 to my motherfucking cranium\nGame tight, gun toting motherfucker\nNiggas in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker\nI tricked 'em, I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em\nI stripped 'em 'cause niggas don't want the friction\nTold you before how I bring the drama\nSlam Larry Johnson and his Grandmama\n[Chorus]\nWhatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\n\n[Verse 3]\nFuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga\nWhen I get busy, throw your hands in the sky nigga\nI got he illest of the ill mentality\nNiggas be grabbing me knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me\nAll up in my back tryna take my crack\nWhen I used to sell crack I never had problems like that\nStreet rules, watch your pockets and your jewels\nNiggas front, the the gat to the fools\nTears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G\nDisrespect me, my potency is deadly\nOnce the venom hits the cerebellum\nMy lips get chapped and my hands start swelling\nKeep the 9 millimeter by the feeder\nTo kill a motherfucker, don't a thing feel sweeter\nOh my head hurt, the blood squirt\nThe robbery expert's berserk\nWhatchu want, nigga?\n[Chorus]\nWhatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu, whatchu want, nigga?"
