Kelly – When A Woman’s Fed Up, but Nas as we know him goes a little realistic.\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n[Verse 1]\nShe was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless\nPerfect definition what a wife is, I like this\nShowed me how excitin' life is\nI used to hang around dudes that use ice picks\nThe sheistiest, put you on they heist list\nHow we met must've been fate\nFirst date — crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak\nShe kept askin' questions how the cash made, how my rent's paid\nHow many guns I sprayed, and huns I laid\nShe said she want to have a family raised, kids someday\nLike out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day\nI can get with that\nI drop you off home, I call, you hit me back\nI wanna dig that, and did I? I did that\nPut it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at\nYou held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats\nYou precious, more precious than lost treasure\nMatter of fact, I'm kinda hopin' we can stay together, word\n\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n[Verse 2]\nI see you dressed up in white, face covered in veil\nDo I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin' rice\nAnd it's the day that your father give you away\nTo a real man that gently put the ring on your hand\nDo we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to\nNow, look me in my eyes and say, \"I do\"\nDrivin' off in the Rolls Royce, just married on the plates\nWe can spend our honeymoon in the States\nYou can throw your friend the bouquet\nSomethin' in the back of my head say, \"Why us two?\"\nMaybe 'cause I love you\nHug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you\nAs long as we together, it's heaven for me to please you\nWon't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful\nDeeper and harder, love layin' new with you\nRunnin' my fingers through your hair\nIt's like days can go by while I'm with you, and I won't even care, word\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, papi's\nColombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas\nThug ones to those soft as baby shit\nShe been with hoodlums, and those who had crazy chips\n'Til one day she decided to flip\nIt was nuttin' I can do about it, like she the boss and shit\nStarted talkin' this divorcin' shit\nI gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake half my car\nHalf my kids? Can't get that\nTried to swing on the God, had to dip that\nYo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that\nAll she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass\nHad to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look\nWith a fine-ass body and a damn good cook\nFor some reason, yo, she had me stuck, and I had her in my web too\nYou my queen, God bless you\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G"
