  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nMmm\n[Verse 1]\nShe wore blue velvet\nBluer than velvet was the night\nSofter than satin was the light\nFrom the stars\n[Verse 2]\nShe wore blue velvet\nBluer than velvet were her eyes\nWarmer than May, her tender sighs\nLove was ours\n[Bridge]\nOurs a love I held tightly\nFeeling the rapture grow\nLike a flame burning brightly\nBut when she left, gone was the glow of\n[Verse 3]\nBlue velvet\nBut in my heart there'll always be\nPrecious and warm a memory\nThrough the years\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I still can see blue velvet through my tears"
