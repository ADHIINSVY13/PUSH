Xzibit backin' down from a conflict\nFuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit\nGlass and metal in every direction\nInnocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson\nI'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon\nAnd reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'\nXzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back\n9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?\nFor me? It's blasphemy\nYou fuckin' around with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy\nYou had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X\nStrangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex\nDrunk drivin', tryna stack my loot\nWhile other rappers gettin' Treated Like a Prostitute\n, \nso check the SoundScan\n\n[Refrain 1: Snoop Dogg]\nAll I wanna be was a G, ha\nMy whole life, nigga please, ha\nBreakin' off these motherfuckin' keys, ha\nLet's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha\nNigga, you don't wanna fuck with this\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nOh, no, Big Snoop Dogg\nBack up in the heezy, baby\nYou jockin' my style?
