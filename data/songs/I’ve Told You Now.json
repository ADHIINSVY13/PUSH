  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou know what I mean\nIt's like walking in the heat all day with no water\nIt's like waiting for a friend\nWatching everybody else meet theirs on that corner\nOr losing in an argument\nThough you're right, can't get your thoughts in order\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStill, I refrain from talking at you, talking on\nYou know me well, I don't explain\n[Chorus]\nBut what the hell?\nWhy do you think I come 'round here on my free will?\nWasting all my precious time\nOh, the truth spills out\nAnd oh, oh I, I've told you now\n[Verse 2]\nYou know what I mean\nAlthough I try my best, I still let down the team\nYou're everything I want\nWhy should I resist when you are there for me?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShould I refrain from talking at you, talking on?\nYou know me well, I don't explain\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what the hell?\nWhy do you think I come 'round here on my free will?\nWasting all my precious time\nOh, the truth spills out\nAnd oh, oh I, I've told you now\n[Bridge]\nI've told you now\nI've told you now\nI've told you now\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStill, I refrain from talking at you, talking on\nYou know me well, I don't explain\n[Chorus]\nSo what the hell?\nWhy do you think I come 'round here on my free will?\nWasting all my precious time\nWhat the hell?\nWhy do you think I come 'round here on my own will?\nWasting all my precious time\nOh, the truth spills out\nAnd oh, oh I, I've told you now"
