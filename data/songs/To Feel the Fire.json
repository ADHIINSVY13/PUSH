  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy outer self looks happy as can be\nA perfect dream, love as clear as all can see\nBut just like that, real has hit me suddenly\nMy outer is a liar\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me\nLoud and clear ,my soul cries out with total honesty\nI need the fire, fire, fire\nTo keep me warm, I got to feel the fire\n[Verse 2]\nMy smiling face with laughter on the side\nYou'd say no doubt, I get passion every night\nBut if in our bed, your arms don't hold me tight\nMeans it leaves much to be desired\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me\nLoud and clear, my soul cries out with total honesty\nI need the fire, fire, fire\nTo keep me warm, I got to feel the fire\nAnd if you look into my eyes\nAnd you told yourself the truth\nYou can't make a body hot if you don't light the fuse\nI need your fire, fire, fire\nTo keep me warm, I got to feel the fire\n\n[Bridge]\nIt don't take a rocket scientist to know\nThat if you don't fan the flame, then the fire will eventually go\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me\nLoud and clear, my soul cries out with total honesty\nI need the fire, fire, fire\nTo keep me warm, I got to feel the fire\n'Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me\nLoud and clear, my soul cries out with total honesty\nI need your fire, fire, fire\nTo keep me warm, I got to feel the fire\n[Outro]\nI need the fire, fire, fire\nTo keep me warm, I got to feel the fire\nTo keep me warm, I've got to feel the fire"
