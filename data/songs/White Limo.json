What do you see in yourself?!\nYou think you're losing, it's time to stop accusing\nYou're never gonna take a hit on the head!\nNow, if you don't care, take a ride somewhere!\n[Chorus]\nHey! It has something you want to try and buy yourself\nHey! It has something, it goes 'round and 'round again\nGo! Go! You should've never wasted your lung!\nGo! Go! And the ride was shared!\n[Post-Chorus]\nGo, Limo!\nGo, Limo!\n[Verse 2]\nI guess you're stuck in the Habitrail, you gotta love this shit!\nWay out on a back shelf, you'll never know what you did!\nLook what you're doing, now Mama said it's ruined\nYou had a mollusk in the palm of your hand!\nSo, it's a bad smell! Your ass won't win!\n[Chorus]\nHey! It has something you wanna try and buy yourself\nHey! It has something, it goes 'round and 'round and 'round again\nGo! Go! You never have been away so long!\nGo! Go! And the ride was shared!\nGo! Go! Whatever happened to DayGlo thongs?!\nGo! Go! And the ride was shared!\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nGo, Limo!\nGo, Limo!\nYeah! Alright!\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Outro]\nWhoa!"
