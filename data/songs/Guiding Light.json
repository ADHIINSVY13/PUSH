  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nPure hearts stumble\nIn my hands, they crumble\nFragile and stripped to the core\nI can't hurt you anymore\nLoved by numbers\nYou're losing life's wonder\nTouch like strangers; detached\nI can't feel you anymore\n[Chorus 1]\nThe sunshine trapped in our hearts\nIt could rise again\nBut I'm lost, crushed\nCold and confused\nWith no guiding light left inside\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou were my guiding light\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus 2]\nWhen comfort\nAnd warmth can't be found I still reach for you\nBut I'm lost, crushed\nCold and confused\nWith no guiding light left inside\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou're my guiding light\nYou're my guiding light\n[Outro]\nWhen there's no guiding light left inside\nWhen there's no guiding light in our lives"
