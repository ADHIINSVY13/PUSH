  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch\nAnd I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left\nWhile a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune\nA mantle of bright light shone down from a room\n[Chorus]\n\"Come down in time\", I still hear her say\nSo clear in my ear like it was today\n\"Come down in time\" was the message she gave\nCome down in time and I'll meet you half way\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I don't know if I should have heard her as yet\nBut a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get\nAnd I, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call\nAnd I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all\n[Chorus]\n\"Come down in time\", I still hear her say\nSo clear in my ear like it was today\n\"Come down in time\" was the message she gave\nCome down in time and I'll meet you half way\n[Outro]\nThere are women, women and some hold you tight\nWhile some leave you counting the stars in the night"
