I cry\nWho was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?\nI'm completely numb, why you acting dumb?\nI won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what to do, you don't know what to say\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay\nThe monster inside you is torturing me\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh\n[Post-Chorus]\nReplay, r-replay, eh-eh\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh\n[Verse 2]\nEvery single day, yeah, I dig a grave\nThen I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave\nIt's a game I play, and I hate to say\nYou're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what to do, you don't know what to say\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay\nThe monster inside you is torturing me\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh\n[Post-Chorus]\nReplay, r-replay, eh-eh\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh\n[Bridge]\nPsychologically, it's something that I can't explain\nScratch my nails into the dirt to pull me out okay\nDoes it matter, does it matter? Damage is done\nDoes it matter, does it matter? You had the gun\nYou had the gun\nYou had the gun\nYou had the gun\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what to do, you don't know what to say\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay\nThe monster inside you is torturing me\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh\n[Outro]\nYour monsters torture me\nYour monsters torture me\nYour monsters torture me\nThe scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh"
