Yeah\n[Verse]\nI be comin' in peace, but fuck me\nBest beware of the others\nThis shit deep, undercovers creep\nThis Southern heat make unbearable summers\nJust last week, seen yo' mama weep\nCrying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother\nThe blood lеaks while the EMTs\nGotta carry her baby likе surrogate mothers\nWoah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered\nThough traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'\nThrough hard times, it was there I discovered\nA hustle and makin' the best out the struggle\nI kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level\nRespect mine, gotta stay out of trouble\n'Cause TEC-9s like the AR rebuttals\nCole World\n, niggas knowin' what it is\nJust in case they don't, I show 'em what it is\nThis summer, I do real numbers\nCouldn't dare touch it if they sold a double disc\nBlock hot, niggas burnin' up the street\nShots poppin' and we heard it up the street\nIt's a war, niggas runnin' up the score\nJesus said that you should turn the other cheek\nWas his niggas gettin' murdered every week?\nDead bodies, smell the odor in the street\nMy homie' home, he got out on parole\nHe sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry\nSummertime bring the coldest winter breeze\nHella blues like the Rollin' 60s\nChrist went to Heaven age thirty-three\nAnd so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey\n\n[Outro]\nI told you, I told you\nThis shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a fuck\nNigga, I done seen the highest heights\nI done seen it twice\nAnd I've seen the lowest of the lows\nAnd still I rose\nNow I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah"
