Am I too grown for this?\nAm I too young to die? Too much a man to cry?\nToo much pride to lie? Someone tell me why\nWhy these hoes all on me now? They used to never look my way\nIf the check bounce back tonight, would you still wanna give me face?\nWhere am I going with this? Am I too grown for this?\nAm I too young to die? Too much a man to cry?\nToo much pride to lie? Someone tell me why\nSomeone tell me why, someone tell me why\nAyy, yuh, yuh\n[Verse]\nI don't respect the hoes I fuck\nOnly know me from \"Get Buck\"\nThey still proceed to swallow nut\nNo questions asked, they pullin' up\nWhy do you fuck with the kid?\nHow do you know where I live?\nHave you been stalking me lately?\nGotta keep my gun off the safety\n\n[Chorus]\nWe all not shit, we all not shit, I own my shit, I'm on my shit\nI'm on my own, I'm all alone, I feel no one, I stay at home\nDon't leave my room, I feel consumed, my life is doomed\nWhere am I going with this? Am I too grown for this?\nAm I too young to die? Too much a man to cry?\nToo much pride to lie? Someone tell me why\nWhy these hoes all on me now? They used to never look my way\nIf the check bounce back tonight, would you still wanna give me face?"
