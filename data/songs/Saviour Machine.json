  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nPresident Joe once had a dream\nThe world held his hand, gave their pledge\nSo he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine\nThey called it The Prayer, its answer was law\nIts logic stopped war, gave them food\nHow they adored till it cried in its boredom\n:\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\n\"Please don't believe in me\nPlease disagree with me\nLife is too easy\nA plague seems quite feasible now\nOr maybe a war\nOr I may kill you all\"\n[Chorus]\nDon't let me stay, don't let me stay\nMy logic says burn, so send me away\nYour minds are too green, I despise all I've seen\nYou can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI need you flying\nAnd I'll show that dying\nIs living beyond reason\nSacred dimension of time\nI perceive every sign\nI can steal every mind\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't let me stay, don't let me stay\nMy logic says burn, so send me away\nYour minds are too green, I despise all I've seen\nYou can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine"
