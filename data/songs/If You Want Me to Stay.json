I guess I wonder how\nCould you get out a pocket for fun\nWhen you know that you're number two\nNumber one gonna be number one\nI'll be good to you, I wish I could\nI get this message over to you now, oh baby\nWhen you see me again, I hope that you have been\nThe kind of person you really are now\nI'll be so good, I wish, I could\nGet the message over to you now\n\nAnd if you want me to stay, baby, if you want me to stay\nIf you want me to stay, I'll be around today\nAvailable for you to see\nI'm about to go and then you'll know\nFor me to stay, I got to be me\nYou'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about\nYou can't take me for granted and smile\nIf you want me to stay\nIf you want me to stay, hey babe\nIf you need me to stay\nIf you want me to stay, baby\nCount the days I'm gone, baby\nCount the days I'm gone, baby\nCount the days I'm gone, yeah\nYeah, baby, I'll stay around if you want me, oh baby\nIf you want me, I'll be around"
