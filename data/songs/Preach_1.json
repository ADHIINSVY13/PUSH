Is that all I can do? Yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah (Uh)\nBut I'm only human\nI can't see the use in me cryin'\nIf I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see\n[Chorus]\nI can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that\nI can find the love when all I see is pain\nFallin' to my knees, and though I do believe (\nThough I do believe\n)\nI can't just preach, baby, preach\nWoah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nI can't just preach, baby, preach\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd Heaven knows I'm not helpless\nBut what can I do? Yeah\nI can't see the use in me cryin'\nIf I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see\n[Chorus]\nI can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that\nI can find the love when all I see is pain\nI try to do the things I say that I believe (\nI do believe\n)\nI can't just preach, baby, preach\nWoah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nI can't just preach, baby, preach\nWoah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nI can't just preach, baby, preach\n\n[Outro]\nFallin' to my knees, and though I do believe\nI can't just preach, baby, preach"
