  "lyrics": "Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet\nComes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat\nComes love, nothing can be done\nComes a fire, then you know just what to do\nBlow a tire, you can get another shoe\nComes love, nothing can be done\nDon't try hiding, 'cause there isn't any use\nYou will start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice\nComes a headache, you can lose it in a day\nComes a toothache, see your dentist right away\nComes love, nothing can be done\nThat's all brother, if you ever been in love\nThat's all brother, you know just what I'm speaking of\nComes a nightmare, you can always stay awake\nComes depression, you may get another break\nComes love, nothing can be done"
