Are you the cure?\nI'm not so sure\n[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bellamy]\nI'm shackled, there is no way out\nI can't escape\n[Chorus: Matt Bellamy]\nWhen you turn out the lights\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\nWhen you skulk 'round the house\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\n[Verse 2: Matt Bellamy & \nElle Evans\n]\nYou cut me off from my friends\nYou cut me off from my family\nI'm in misery (\nI'm your number one fan\n)\nEach day, I fall to my knees\nI see the writing is on the wall\nNow I'm in withdrawal\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Matt Bellamy]\nI'm shackled, there is no way out\n(There is nothing I can do to escape)\nI can't escape\n[Chorus: Matt Bellamy]\nWhen you turn out the lights\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\nThe way you skulk 'round the house\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Breakdown: Matt Bellamy]\nAh\n[Chorus: Matt Bellamy]\nWhen you turn out the lights\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\nWhen you skulk 'round the house\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\n\n[Chorus: Matt Bellamy]\nI see your eye in the keyhole\nI feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\nWon't rest until I'm possessed\nYou make me feel like it's Halloween (Halloween)\nIt's Halloween (Halloween)\n[Outro: Vincent Price]\n(But you are the caretaker)"
