  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou held my hand and then you slipped away\nAnd I may never see your face again\nSo tell me how to fill the emptiness inside\nWithout love, what is life?\nAnd anyone who knew us\nBoth can see we always were the better part of me\nI never wanted to be this free and all this pain\nWhen does it go away?\n[Chorus]\nThen every-time I turn around\nAnd you're nowhere to be found I know\nI got a long long way to go before I can say\nGoodbye to you oh, I got a long long way I know\nBefore I can say goodbye to all I ever knew, to you to you\n[Verse 2]\nFrom memory there is no hiding place\nTurn on the TV and I see you there\nIn every crowd there's always someone with your face\nEverywhere, trying not to care\n[Chorus]\nThen every-time I turn around\nAnd you're nowhere to be found I know\nI got a long long way to go before I can say\nGoodbye to you oh, I got a long long way I know\nBefore I can say goodbye to all I ever knew, to you to you\n\n[Bridge]\nTo you I wish you everything\nAnd all the best that life can bring\nI only hope you think of me sometimes, oh\nAnd even though I fell the pain\nI know that you will love again\nThe time will come and you'll move on\n[Outro]\nI got a long long way to go before I can say\nGoodbye to you oh, I got a long long way I know\nGot a long way to go before I can say goodbye\nBefore I can say goodbye to all I ever knew\nTo all I ever knew I got a long way to go\nBefore I say say goodbye, say goodbye\nBut I wish you the best girl oh and all of the rest to you"
