  "lyrics": "I know there were a hundred ways to tell her I loved her\nIt's funny how they're all so clear today\nAnd when her face was burning with sadness and yearning\nI don't know why I turned my eyes away\nBut it's so easy looking at the game the morning after\nAdding up the kisses and the laughter\nKnowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came\nBut then, a \nMonday morning quarterback never lost a game\nThe room was so alive with all her feelings and longings\nI saw the spark of danger in her eyes\nWell, how would it have hurt me if I'd turned back and held her?\nA moment passes, something lovely dies\nBut it's so easy looking at the game the morning after\nAdding up the kisses and the laughter\nKnowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came\nBut then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game\nYes, it's easier to win it when you know you'd never play it quite the same\nBut then, this Monday morning quarterback never lost a game"
