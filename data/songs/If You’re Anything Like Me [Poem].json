  "lyrics": "If you're anything like me,\nYou bite your nails,\nAnd laugh when you're nervous.\nYou promise people the world,\nbecause that's what they want from you.\nYou like giving them what they want...\nBut darling, you need to stop,\nIf you're anything like me,\nYou knock on wood every time you make plans.\nYou cross your fingers, hold your breath,\nWish on lucky numbers and eyelashes\nYour superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.\nRest In Peace, to your naive bravado...\nIf life gets too good now,\nDarling, it scares you.\nIf you're anything like me,\nYou never wanted to lock your door,\nYour secret garden gate or your diary drawer\nDidn't want to face the you you don't know anymore\nFor fear she was much better before...\nBut Darling, now you have to.\nIf you're anything like me,\nThere's a justice system in your head\nFor names you'll never speak again,\nAnd you make your ruthless rulings.\nEach new enemy turns to steel\nThey become the bars that confine you,\nIn your own little golden prison cell...\nBut Darling, there is where you meet yourself.\n\nIf you're anything like me\nYou've grown to hate your pride\nTo love your thighs\nAnd no amount of friends at 25\nWill fill the empty seats\nAt the lunch tables of your past\nThe teams that picked you last...\nBut Darling, you keep trying.\nIf you're anything like me,\nYou couldn't recognize the face of your love\nUntil they stripped you of your shiny paint\nThrew your victory flag away\nAnd you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...\nDarling, later on you will thank your stars\nfor that frightful day.\nIf you're anything like me,\nI'm sorry.\nBut Darling, it's going to be okay."
