  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe summer wind, came blowin' in from across the sea\nIt lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me\nAll summer long, we sang a song\nAnd then we strolled that golden sand\nTwo sweethearts, and the summer wind\n[Verse 2]\nLike painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by\nThe world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky\nThen softer than, a piper man, one day it called to you\nI lost you, I lost you to the summer wind\n[Verse 3]\nThe autumn wind, and the winter winds\nThey have come and gone\nAnd still the days, those lonely days they go on and on\nAnd guess who sighs his lullabies\nThrough nights that never end\nMy fickle friend, the summer wind\n[Outro]\nThe summer wind\nWarm summer wind\nThe summer wind"
