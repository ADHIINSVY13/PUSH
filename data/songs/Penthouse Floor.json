Just playin'\nJust me, new phone, new hair, new era\nI'm in the penthouse, baby\nHandpicked from bad apples and bad eggs\nHeld back, I had to grab crab legs\nAnd then there were only but a few\nConversations held with patience, what a party, what a view\nWhat a dress, what a song\nWhat a beautiful time\nMy folks downstairs still waitin' in line\nThey never been in these rooms\nNever stayed with these folks\nNever laughed at the news, never hated these jokes\nSo as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover\nForcin' a new smile, he tells me another\nHe said \"What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?\"\nThen he pushed me off the top and said \"Jump, nigga, jump!\"\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nOh donâ€™t bring me down I need a room up in the clouds\nI wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate\nOh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss\nIn the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nLet's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for\nWe'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nThose penthouse doors\nWe'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nBaby, I'm in the penthouse floor\nBaby, let's ride the elevator\nTil we can rise some more\nGo to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)"
