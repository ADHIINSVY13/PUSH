I \nrefuse to sit in the backseat and get handled\nLike I do nothin' all day but sit around, watch the cartoon channel\nI rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal\nThat followed, and we all watched the nation as it swallowed\nAnd chalked it up; basically America, you got fucked\nThe media shucked and jived, now we stuck, damn\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nOperation Anaconda; ask yourself\nWas it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?\nAnd why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price\nFor his life and his wife plead twice?\nSee Al-Amin got life and\n \nFred got dead, Hampton\nTo dampen the dream of all the Panthers\nThey got they answer for ransom\nAs we read together, as we dream together\nCount your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better\nBut it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you\nYour brainwaves, airwaves, energized and shocked you\nY'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin'\nI'ma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen\nNow eat, nigga"
