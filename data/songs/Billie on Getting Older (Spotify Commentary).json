  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"Getting Older\" was tough to write, you know, 'cause it's a very revealing song and it's talking about things that I, only at the time, had just felt like I realized about myself and felt insecure about, and wanted to talk about, and... I don't know, I think that that happens a lot and it should be completely... welcomed, is realizing stuff years later [laughs]. You sometimes don't realize what's going on around you until a really long time later, or realize what you feel until years later."
