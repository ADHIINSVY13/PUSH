(Where's your Shangri-La?)\nWhere is your Shangri-La now? (Where's your Shangri-La?)\nCountin' down to zero hour\n[Chorus]\nThere ain't no superheroes now\nThere ain't no superheroes, they're underground\nHappy ever after, countin' down to zero hour\nThere ain't no superheroes now\nThere ain't no superheroes, they're underground\nHappy ever after, countin' down to zero hour"
