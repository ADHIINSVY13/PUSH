  "lyrics": "“Ours” is a track on the deluxe edition of Taylor Swift’s 2010 album Speak Now. Like her song “Love Story,” it tells the tale of a love frowned upon by others.\n[Verse 1]\nElevator buttons and morning air\nStrangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs\nIf you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares\nBut right now, my time is theirs\nSeems like there's always someone who disapproves\nThey'll judge it like they know about me and you\nAnd the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\nThe jury's out, but my choice is you\n[Chorus]\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\n[Verse 2]\nYou never know what people have up their sleeves\nGhosts from your past gonna jump out at me\nLurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\nBut I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine\nAnd you'll say\n[Chorus]\nDon't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and\nYour hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and\nI'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you\n'Cause I love the gap between your teeth\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos\nWill be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours\n[Chorus]\nSo don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nAnd don't you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nBut they can't take what's ours\nThey can't take what's ours\nThe stakes are high, the water's rough\nBut this love is ours"
