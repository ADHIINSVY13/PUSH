I don't think there's no other king out there\nNobody could take that, that, that crown from him right there!\nThe legacy of B.I.G. is something real deep, man\nGo back to a bunch of roots, man, Notorious about family and keepin' it tight\nThat, that's one of the best that ever did it!\nRepresented what he represented, did what he did\nYoukno'Imean?\nHe put Brooklyn on his back\nHe represented the hood, he represented New york City\nRespect to my dude, man!\nI love you man!\nJust like you hear, man\nB.I.G. Forever... youkno'Imean?\nM.A.F.I.A. Gang!\nRest In Peace B.I.G.!"
