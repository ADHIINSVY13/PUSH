It’s one of four solo tracks on the album, and features production from A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip.\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nThey been trying to tie me to the BALCO\nToo many clicks in the dial tone\nI’m my city’s Willy Falcon\nHow you niggas celebrating Alpo?\nI’m disgusted\nInterior rustic, the mustard-colored wall’s adjusted\nTrap doors everywhere\nMacs come out the floor,\n \ndinners at the Forge\nFour Seasons all four seasons\nIt’s good to have a getaway for no reason\nConcierge never speak\n‘Cause this week look like last week\nThey both named Ashley\nI might travel to El Barrio\nTo get it from Daddy-O then adios\nCellphone at the back patio\nI didn’t have to make a cameo to get it off\n[Hook]\nI hope you betting on the sleeper\nIt all started on a beeper \nNow they asking for the feature\nTill I'm steppin' out the bleachers\nDrug money kicked around like it’s FIFA\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nYuugh! Pops up like dandruff\nBeverly Hills Jed Clampett\nA shotgun wedding to collect my ransom\nCameo Chris Hansen\nI’m at your door\nYou don’t wanna know him if you owe him\nI done boxed in cars and had to tow ‘em\nI done laid in lawns when they didn’t mow ‘em\nEven hogtied wives, I had to show ‘em\nThat I mean business\nI mean everything I say, no witness\nNo forgiveness, Souls of Mischief \nIt’s on through infinity, my arms are endless\nYour arms, too short to box with God\nMight send a bitch a Elie Saab\nShe fucks and robs\n10 grand just to touch the job\nClose range, she don’t duck and dodge\nYou can’t trust them odds\n[Hook]\nI hope you betting on the sleeper\nIt all started on a beeper \nNow they asking for the feature\nTill I'm steppin' out the bleachers\nDrug money kicked around like it’s FIFA\nI hope you betting on the sleeper\nIt all started on a beeper \nNow they asking for the feature\nTill I'm steppin' out the bleachers\nDrug money kicked around like it’s FIFA"
