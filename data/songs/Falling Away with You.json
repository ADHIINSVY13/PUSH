  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can't remember when it was good\nMoments of happiness elude\nMaybe I just misunderstood\nAll of the love we left behind\nWatching the flashbacks intertwine\nMemories I will never find\nSo I'll love whatever you become\nAnd forget the reckless things we've done\nI think our lives have just begun\nI think our lives have just begun\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll feel my world crumbling\nI'll feel my life crumbling\nI'll feel my soul crumbling away\nAnd falling away\nFalling away with you\n[Verse 2]\nStaying awake to chase a dream\nTasting the air you're breathing in\nI know I won't forget a thing\nPromise to hold you close and pray\nWatching the fantasies decay\nNothing will ever stay the same\nAnd all of the love we threw away\nAnd all of the hopes we've cherished fade\nMaking the same mistakes again\nMaking the same mistakes again\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll feel my world crumbling\nI'll feel my life crumbling\nI'll feel my soul crumbling away\nAnd falling away\nFalling away with you\n[Outro]\nAll of the love we left behind\nWatching the flashbacks intertwine\nMemories I will never find\nMemories I will never find"
