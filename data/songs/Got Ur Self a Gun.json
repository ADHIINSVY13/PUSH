Hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nMy first album had no famous guest appearances\nThe outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist\nMany years on this professional level\nWhy would you question who's better? The world is still mine\nTattoo's real, with \"God's Son\" across the belly, the boss of rap\nYou saw me in \nBelly\n with thoughts like that\nTo take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie\nMe and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle\nYou lames could huddle, \nyour team's shook\nY'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field\nThrowin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel\nBut the QB don't stand for no quarterback\nEvery word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft\nAnd I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in\nIt's for the hood by the corner store\nMany try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody\n\n[Chorus: Nas & \nAlabama 3\n]\nI got mine, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\n, yo\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nI'm the N, the A to the S-I-R\nAnd if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar\nYou know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed\n, hair parted with a\nBarber's preciseness, \nBravehearted for life,\n it's\nReturn of the golden child,\n \nson of a blues player\nSo who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior\nPuffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too\nPapi chu's\n, tore up, wake up in a hospital\nThrow up? Never, \n'member I do this through righteous steps\nYou Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death\nY'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos\nCall me God's Son with my pants low\nI don't die slow\n, \nput them rags up like Petey Pablo\nThis is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow\nWhat could beat that?\n \nNot a soul reppin'\nHit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo\n\n[Chorus: Nas & \nAlabama 3\n]\nI got mine, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nIt's the return of the prince, the boss\nThis is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft\nSip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss\nStick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche\nWith the top cut off\n, rich kids go and cop \nThe Source\nThey don't know about the blocks I'm on\nAnd everybody wanna know where the kid go\nWhere he rest at, where he shop at and dress at\nKnow he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?\nDoes he really know how ill that he is?\nGot all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels\nHop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that\nIt's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains\nLook at my tennis shoes, I iced that\nWho am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper\nAutomatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter\nKeepin' it gangsta with ya\n (Uh)\n\n[Chorus: Nas & \nAlabama 3\n]\nI got mine, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\n[Outro: Nas & \nAlabama 3\n]\nGot yourself a gun\n (Uh)\nI got mine, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou want beef? Hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nAnd when I see you, I'ma take what I want, so\nYou tried to front, hope you \ngot yourself a gun\nYou ain't real, hope you \ngot yourself a gun"
