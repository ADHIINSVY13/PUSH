  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nBaby, something I been feeling in the depths of my heart\nHmm\nVari, Vari\nYeah\nYeah, uh\n[Verse 1]\nGod is real and he usin' me for a bigger purpose\nSo fuck the world that would have you think that a nigga worthless\nSometimes I think that these verses can help a person\nWay more than the ones they readin' in churches on days of worship\nNo disrespect to the Lord and Savior, that ain't just ego\nI just observe that them words no longer relate to people\n'Cause modern times be flooded with dollar signs\nAnd social media stuntin', my niggas just wanna shine\nThey frame of mind so far removed from the days and times\nOf Nazareth\nLife these days is a labyrinth, in a maze so elaborate\nWe barely get through half of it 'fore it's too late\nMy niggas is felons from sellin' weight in more than two states\n.22 on his waist before he could even shoot straight\nQuick to draw on you like Aaron McGruder, nigga who fate?\nAll of that to say maybe the hood need a new faith\nA new story about a boy from not too far where you stay\n\n[Chorus]\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\n[Verse 2]\nHis momma was a virgin named Yolanda\nAnd she raised him on her own, after she was disowned\nHer momma called her a liar, said \"Get the fuck out my home\"\nSince you wanna be grown\nSo, there she was now, seventeen and alone\nBut this lil' boy that grew in her stomach made her feel strong\nThe angels paid her a visit one night and let it be known\nThis was God's child, woman behold the miracle\nShe shed tears 'cause she never believed in a spiritual\nBut her heart was pure and she was good\nFor eighteen years she raised him on Section 8 in the cold embrace of the hood\nDid the best as she could, the boy was named Javari\nWalked with the spirit of his father emanatin' from body\n[Chorus]\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack in the hood, look at lil' Vari preach\nHis words were full of spirit, his truth it would always reach\nHe laid his hands on Toya, when niggas called her a freak\nAnd told her that God loved her no matter who she let beat\nBut bein' promiscuous is a sign that there's something deep\nThat troubles her soul, the day she lets it go, she'll find peace\nShe broke down admittin' her stepfather had touched her for years\nShe kept it secret for fear of her mother's grief\nNow the bitterness she feels for that nigga is at a peak\nAnd her lack of self-esteem is the reason that she would sleep with anybody\nAnd not think twice, Javari spoke calmly\nInstructin' her to forgive her stepfather\nThough he was wrong he was sick\nAfflicted by evil, but the power to switch\nHow you feel about people who hurt you is truly a gift\nThe thing that can make you rich or keep you down in a ditch\nIf you refuse to let go of the ground, then how can you lift?\nInto the sky where you belong with the most high\nNow wipe those tears from your eyes, my father wants you to fly\n[Chorus]\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\n\n[Interlude]\nBaby, something I been fe\neling in the depths of\n my heart\n[Verse 4]\nBack in the hood, Javari built up a followin'\nNiggas put down they pistols eventually\nAnd stopped swallowin' molly pills\nInstead now they bodies fill with spirit\nTwelve lil' homies soakin' up every word that they hearin'\nThe neighborhood done changed in attitude and appearance\nPolice dumbfounded by lack of crime and they swear it's a fluke\nNot knowin' the truth, that this a miracle\nNiggas is wakin' up with the powers that be they fearing\nSo government keep a tap on Javari and those who practice adherence\nTo things he teaching and then comes to interference\nThey stormed the hood, guns out\nBust into the house that he slept in\nA warrant claimin' suspicion of drug possession\nBut Vari sat calmly as if he had been expectin'\nHeart full of love, even for those who need to oppress him\nThey told him \"Hands up\" and he did just as they directed\nThey fired on him, claiming they thought he reached for a weapon\nHe laid on the floor breathless, blood leakin' from his chest\nPlus a bullet-hole through both of his palms, ain't that a message?\nThe neighborhood was stressin'\nThe son of God murdered and carried away on stretcher by the oppressor, but\nThree days later, the coroner pulled the table\nAnd what happened next is like somethin' you see on cable or hear in a fable\nHe was suddenly able to open his eyes, look at him rise, the coroner was surprised\nWithout a word Javari walked out, went straight to the hood\nThe people couldn't believe it, they froze right where they stood\nAs he walked by, shinin' like a million diamond chains\nGod flowin' from every inch of his frame\nHe said \"Hear me out my niggas, let me be your proof, my father is real\nAnd through love, homie, peace can be found in the ville\nI died for you, so that one day you would be able to see you a child of God, just like me\"\nHear me out my niggas, let me be your proof, my father is real\nAnd through love, homie, peace can be found in the ville\nI died for you, so that one day you would be able to see you a child of God, just like me\nAnd I\n[Chorus]\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, mhmm\nWant you to fly, want you to fly, here we go, go\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nCan I hear that?"
