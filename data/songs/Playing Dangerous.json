(Officer)\nGosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my nightgownâ€‹\nDo you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLooking at me, then suddenly\n[Chorus]\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLovin' hurricane\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLove in a hurricane\nI've been bad, I've been wrong\nPlaying a dangerous game\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOfficer\nOfficer\nOfficer\n[Verse 2]\nLet's get in the back of your cop car, officer\nYou can ask me anything you want, anything, anything\nDo you have a girl? I don't see a ring on your finger\nWell that's interesting, have you ever thought of dating a singer?\nThe flames are getting higher, so's my desire\nIt's kind of exciting, don't you think?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThen suddenly he's uncuffing me\n[Chorus]\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLovin' hurricane\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLove in a hurricane\nI've been bad, I've been wrong\nPlaying a dangerous game\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you can't stand the heat\nThen stay out of the fire\nYou might get what you desire, boy\nLove is strange\nSometimes it makes you crazy\nIt can burn or break you\nIf you can't stand the heat\nThen stay out of the fire\nYou might get what you desire, boy\nLove is strange\nSometimes it makes you crazy\nIt can burn or break you down\n[Chorus]\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLovin' hurricane\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLove in a hurricane\nI've been bad, I've been wrong\nPlaying a dangerous game\nI'm in love, I'm in love\nLovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane"
