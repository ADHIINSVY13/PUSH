  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe boat rides we would take\nThe moonlight on the lake\nThe way we danced and hummed our fav'rite song\n[Refrain]\nThe things we did last summer\nI'll remember all winter long\n[Verse 2]\nThe midway and the fun\nThe Kewpie dolls we won\nThe bell I rang to prove that I was strong\n[Refrain]\nThe things we did last summer\nI'll remember all winter long\n[Bridge]\nThe early morning hike\nThe rented tandem bike\nThe lunches that we used to pack\nWe never could explain\nThat sudden summer rain\nThe looks we got when we got back\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe leaves began to fade\nLike promises we made\nHow could a love that seemed so right go wrong?\n[Refrain]\nThe things we did last summer\nI'll remember all winter long\n[Verse 4]\nI've tried so to forget\nAt times I do, and yet\nThe mem'ry of you lingers like our song\n[Refrain]\nThe things we did last summer\nI'll remember all winter long"
