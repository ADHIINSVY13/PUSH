  "lyrics": "Hey Lucy why don't you come and settle down\nI hear you're the baddest girl this side of town\nGot a little money that I wanna spend\nIf you'll be my friend\nFor just a little while\nFirst summer you sailed on down to New Orleans\nI was a victor, you were a Cajun queen\nYou had many fellas with lots of style\nAnd you drove them wild\nOh little Lucy I had to be with you\nTraveled around the country\nOh and I made my way\nI never once forgot what I felt that day\nNow I think I'm ready to play my hand\nI wanna be your man which is hard to do\nOh Lucy I'm so in love with you\nI've been a wandering man for such a long time\nNow I know just where I'm going\nOh how I need you to stand by my side\nDon't you go away\nCause I'm so in love with you\nI've been searchin' for you Lucy for such a long time\nNow I wanna let you know what I have on my mind\nYou've been around a lonely man\nA lonely man\nI've been a lonely man\nLucy\nI don't want to live my life without you\nThere were times when I tried to get you off my mind girl\nYou're the girl of my dreams\nOh you're the girl of my dreams\nLucy\n(Ahh my Lucy)\nSo many lonely nights I need you girl\n(Ahh my Lucy)"
