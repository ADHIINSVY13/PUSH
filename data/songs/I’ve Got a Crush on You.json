  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHow glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians\nWould be to capture me\nBut you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance\nI fell and it was swell\n[Verse 2]\nI'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo\nHow I won you, I shall never, never know\nIt's not that you're attractive, but, oh, my heart grew active\nWhen you came into view\n[Verse 3]\nI've got a crush on you, sweetie pie\nAll the day and nighttime, hear me sigh\nI never had the least notion\nThat I could fall with so much emotion\n[Verse 4]\nCould you coo, could you care\nFor a cunning cottage that we could share?\nThe world will pardon my mush\n'Cause I have got a crush on you, my baby, on you"
