It's a crazy thing\nI showed you my hand and you still let me win\nAnd who was I to say that this was meant to be?\nThe road that was broken brought us together\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know you could fall for a thousand kings\nAnd hearts that would give you a diamond ring\nWhen I fold, you see the best in me\nThe joker and the queen\n[Verse 2]\nI was upside down from the outside in\nYou came to the table and you went all in\nWith a single word and a gentle touch\nYou turned a moment into forever\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know you could fall for a thousand kings\nAnd hearts that could give you a diamond ring\nWhen I fold, you see the best in me\nThe joker and the queen\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know you could fall for a thousand kings\nAnd hearts that would givе you a diamond ring\nWhen I folded, you saw the bеst in me\nThe joker and the queen\nThe joker and the queen"
