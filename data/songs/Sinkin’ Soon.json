  "lyrics": "We're an oyster cracker on the stew\nAnd the honey in the tea\nWe're the sugar cubes, one lump or two\nIn the black coffee\nThe golden crust on an apple pie\nThat shines in the sun at noon\nWe're a wheel of cheese high in the sky\nBut we're gonna be sinkin' soon\nIn a boat that's built of sticks and hay\nWe drifted from the shore\nWith a captain who's too proud to say\nThat he dropped the oar\nA tiny hole has sprung a leak\nIn this cheap pontoon\nNow the hull has started growing weak\nAnd we're gonna be sinkin' soon (we are)\nWe're gonna be sinkin' soon\nWe're gonna be sinkin' soon\nEverybody hold your breath 'cause\nWe're gonna be sinkin' soon\nWe're gonna be sinkin' soon\nWe're gonna be sinkin' soon\nEverybody hold your breath\nAnd down and down we go\n\nLike the oyster cracker on the stew\nThe honey in the tea\nThe sugar cubes, one lump or two?\nNo thank you, none for me\nWe're the golden crust on the apple pie\nThat shines in the sun at noon\nLike the wheel of cheese high in the sky\nWell we're gonna be sinkin' soon"
