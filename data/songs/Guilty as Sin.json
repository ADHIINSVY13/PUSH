  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDrownin' in the Blue Nile\nHe sent me \"Downtown Lights\"\nI hadn't heard it in a while\nMy boredom's bone-deep\nThis cage was once just fine\nAm I allowed to cry?\nI dream of crackin' locks\nThrowin' my life to the wolves\n or \nthe ocean rocks\nCrashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox\nI'm seeing visions\nAm I bad or mad or wise?\n[Chorus]\nWhat if he's \nwritten\n \n\"mine\"\n on my \nupper thigh\n \nonly in my mind?\nOne slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze\nOh, what a way to die\nI keep recalling things we never did\nMessy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts\nWithout ever touchin' his skin\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n[Verse 2]\nI keep these longings lockеd\nIn lowercase, inside a vault\nSomеone told me, \"There's no such thing as bad thoughts\nOnly your actions talk\"\nThese fatal fantasies\nGiving way to labored breath, takin' all of me\nWe've already done it in my head\nIf it's make-believe\nWhy does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if he's written \"mine\" on my upper thigh only in my mind?\nOne slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze\nOh, what a way to die\nMy bed sheets are ablaze\nI've screamed his name\nBuildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave\nWithout ever touchin' his skin\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n[Bridge]\nWhat if I roll the stone away?\nThey're gonna crucify me anyway\nWhat if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?\nIf long-suffering propriety is what they want from me\nThey don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly\nI choose you and me religiously\n[Chorus]\nWhat if he's written \"mine\" on my upper thigh only in my mind?\nOne slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze\nOh, what a way to die\nI keep recalling things we never did\nMessy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts\nWithout ever touchin' his skin\nHow can I be guilty as sin?\n\n[Outro]\nHe sent me \"Downtown Lights\"\nI hadn't heard it in a while\nAm I allowed to cry?"
