  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Brian May]\nA hand above the water\nAn angel reachin' for the sky\nIs it raining in Heaven?\nDo you want us to cry?\nAnd everywhere the brokenhearted\nOn every lonely avenue\nNo one could reach them\nNo one but you\n[Chorus: Brian May]\nOne by one\nOnly the good die young\nThey're only flyin' too close to the sun\nAnd life goes on\nWithout you\n[Verse 2: Roger Taylor]\nAnother tricky situation\nI get to drowning in the blues\nAnd I find myself thinkin'\nWell, what would you do? (Ooh)\nYes, it was such an operation (Ooh)\nForever payin' every due (Ooh)\nHell, you made a sensation (You made a sensation)\nYou found a way through (You found a way through)\n\n[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Brian May, \nRoger Taylor\n]\nOne by one\nOnly the good die young\nThey're only flyin' too close to the sun\nWe'll remember\nForever\n[Verse 3: Brian May]\nAnd now the party must be over\nI guess we'll never understand\nThe sense of your leaving\nWas in the way it was planned\nAnd so we grace another table\nAnd raise our glasses one more time\nThere's a face at the window\nAnd I ain't never, never saying goodbye\n[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Brian May]\nAnd it's one by one\nOnly the good die young\nThey're only flyin' too close to the sun\n[Outro: Brian May & \nRoger Taylor\n]\nCrying for nothin'\nCrying for no one\nNo one but you"
