  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThis week dragged past me so slowly\nThe days fell on their knees\nMaybe I'll take something to help me\nHope someone takes after me\nI guess there's always some change in the weather\nThis time I know we could get it together\nIf I did casually mention tonight\nThat would be crazy tonight\n[Chorus]\nStay, that's what I meant to say\nOr do something, but what I never say is\nStay this time, I really meant to so bad this time\n'Cause you can never really tell\nWhen somebody wants something you want too\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 2]\nHeart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight\nLife is so vague when it brings someone new\nThis time tomorrow I'll know what to do\nI know it's happened to you\n\n[Chorus]\nStay, that's what I meant to say\nOr do something, but what I never say is\nStay this time, I really meant to so bad this time\n'Cause you can never really tell\nWhen somebody wants so much to\nStay, that's what I meant to say\nOr do something, but what I never say is\nStay this time, I really meant to so bad this time\n'Cause you can never really tell\nWhen somebody wants something you want too\n[Instrumental Outro]"
