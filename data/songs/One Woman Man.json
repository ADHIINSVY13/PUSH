In his life, this woman is his wife, Chrissy Teigen.\n[Verse 1]\nI always believed that love was surrender\nAnd I wouldn't go down without a fight\nI always left room for other contenders\n'Cause I might change my mind\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nDamn, I used to be so cold\nWould never ever get too close\nDidn't ever wanna lose control\nBut from the moment that I tasted\nI knew that I would have to chase it\nYou said hold up, I want you to be\n[Chorus]\nA one woman man\nA one woman man, oh\nWant you all to myself\nDon't want nobody else\nAll your loving\nAll or nothing\nWon't you be\nA one woman man (one woman)\nA one woman man, oh (one woman)\n[Verse 2]\nYou made me believe that love was forever\nAnd love could sustain us through every fight\nI let go of all of the other pretenders\nThey were wasting my time\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI never thought that I would say this\nBut I can see us having babies\nI could see it from the start\nThat I might give you my heart\nFrom the moment that I met you\nKnew that I would never let you\nSlip away, it's okay\nYou can make me\n[Chorus]\nA one woman man\nA one woman man, oh\nI want you all to myself\nDon't want nobody else\nAll my loving\nAll or nothing\nI can be\nA one woman man (One woman)\nA one woman man, uh (One woman)\n[Bridge]\nI could never say I loved you\nI kept up my guard\nBut you broke in my house\nYou've stolen my heart\nNow I've given you the key\nGot all of you for all of me\nBut baby, I promise to be\n\n[Chorus]\nA one woman man, oh\nI want you all to myself\nDon't want nobody else\nAll my loving\nAll or nothing\nI can be\nA one woman man (One woman)\nA one woman man, uh (One woman)"
