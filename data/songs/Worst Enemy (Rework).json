  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLying in my bed alone\nNo I never sleep\nI'm only blaming me\nStarring at the walls I know\nAll the pain they've seen\nDon't pity me, no room for sympathy\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid this to myself\nI lied to me\nI'm nothing but a liability\nI let me down\nI cut me deep\nI am my own worst enemy\n[Chorus]\nI'm maybe broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nFinding a reason to pick up the pieces\nAnd build up what's left of me\nI know I'm broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nTired of losing and making excuses\nI'm building up what's left of me\n\n[Verse 2]\nRoom is filling up with doubt\nCaving in between floor and ceilling\nOpen from the inside out\nSomething no one sees\nI bruise and bleed\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid this to myself\nI lied to me\nI'm nothing but a liability\nI let me down\nI cut me deep\nI am my own worst enemy\n[Chorus]\nI'm maybe broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nFinding a reason to pick up the pieces\nAnd build up what's left of me\nI know I'm broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nTired of losing and making excuses\nI'm building up what's left of me\n[Bridge]\nJust me figuring out myself\nTrying to grow Ain't I, ain't i?\nJust me don't wanna drown\nMyself trying to float\nAin't I, ain't I?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm maybe broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nFinding a reason to pick up the pieces\nAnd build up what's left of me\nI know I'm broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nTired of losing and making excuses\nI'm building up what's left of me\n[Outro]\nI'm maybe broken\nBut I'm still holding on to me\nFinding a reason to pick up the pieces\nAnd build up what's left of me"
