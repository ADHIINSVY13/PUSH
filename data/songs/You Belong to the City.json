  "lyrics": "The sun goes down\nThe night rolls in\nYou can feel it starting all over again\nThe moon comes up\nAnd the music calls\nYou're getting tired of staring at the same four walls\nYou're out of your room\nAnd down on the street\nMoving through the crowds through the midnight heat\nThe traffic roars\nAnd the sirens scream\nYou look at the faces, its just like a dream\nNobody know where you're going\nNobody cares where you've been\n'Cause you belong to the city\nYou belong to the night\nLiving in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light\nYou were born in the city\nConcrete under your feet\nIt's in your blood, its in your moves\nYou're a man of the street\nWhen you said goodbye\n\nYou were on the run\nTryin' to get away from all the things you'd done\nNow you're back again\nAnd you're feeling strange\nSo much has happened, but nothing has changed\nYou still don't know where you're going\nYour still just a face in the crowd\n'Cause you belong to the city...\nYou can feel it\nYou can taste it\nYou can see it\nYou can face it\nYou can hear it\nYou're getting near it\nYou wanna make it\n'Cause you can take it\nYou belong to the city"
