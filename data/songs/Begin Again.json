  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEvery thought that I ignore\nAnother question's at my door\nYes, when will we begin\nTo believe in this again?\nCan we believe?\nCan we believe?\nI walk down the street\nWith shadows at my feet\nAnd words in my head\nSo much left unsaid\nDo you know how we got here?\nDo you know how we got here?\n[Verse 2]\nI drank to clear my throat\nEnough to eat the words you wrote\nI've said these words before\nFelt this way, closed that door\nAre you a stranger?\nAre you a stranger?\n[Bridge]\nNever seemed to bother me\nNow I find it hard to breathe\nEverything that you wrote\nSticks inside and chokes my throat\nDo I think way too much?\nAre we running out of luck?\n\n[Outro]\nCan a nation built on blood\nFind its way out of the mud?\nWill the people at the top\nLose their way enough to stop?\nCan we begin again?\nCan we begin again?\nCan we begin again?\nCan we begin again?"
