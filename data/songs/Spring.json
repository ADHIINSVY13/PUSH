I've lost the nerve\nThis year flew by without a word\nI had a plan to cross the world\nBut haven't left this island\nThe stores closed down and opened up\nI said I'd do a sober month\nI failed, but tried and wrote this drunk\nIn overwhelming silence\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll see my friends when all this ends\nBut now until then, I'm holdin' out for spring\nWe can't let winter win\nThat's why I'm holdin' out for spring\nOh, what a state we're in\nI'll keep holdin' out for spring\n[Verse 2]\nHomework and cancelled holidays\nThe blame gets passed to save a face\nThe smell of last night's takeaway\nJust tells me I'm a mess\nStill watchin' shows they recommend\nThat don't get good until the end\nI could be unwell, but then again\nMaybe I'm just depressed\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll fix my head when all this ends\nBut now until then, I'm holdin' out for spring\nWe can't let winter win\nThat's why I'm holdin' out for spring\nOh, what a state we're in\nI'll keep holdin' out for spring\n[Bridge]\nTime, blue skies\nFrost fades slowly\nCrossed my mind to linger\nAnd hold out for spring\n[Outro]\nWe can't let winter win\nThat's why I'm holdin' out for spring\nOh, what a state we're in"
