  "lyrics": "The plot begins with you\nAnd me in darklit rooms\nYour cigarette cuts through\nI wear it like perfume\nThe melody gives way\nWe silently behave\nThe story never read\nIs torn up into shreds\nI see it in your eyes\nThe invitation lies\nBut pages left to turn\nOur chapters we should burn\nThe melody gives way\nWe silently behave\nThe story never read\nIs torn up into shreds\nI see it in your eyes\nThe invitation lies\nBut pages left to turn\nOur chapters we should burn"
