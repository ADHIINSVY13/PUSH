  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTake a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks\nWhere the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks\nWhere secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires\nWell, you know you're never coming back\nPast the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks\n[Chorus]\nOn a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man\nIn a dusty black coat with a \nred right hand\n[Verse 2]\nHe'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that \nyou've been a good boy\nHe'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy\nHe'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul\nAnd there won't be a single thing that you can do\nHe's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru\n[Chorus]\nThey're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land\nBut hidden in his coat is a red right hand\n[Verse 3]\nYou don't have no money? He'll get you some\nIf you haven't got no car, he'll get you one\nYou've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect\nWell, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes\nThrough the ghetto and the barrows\nAnd the Bowery and the slums\n\n[Chorus]\nA shadow is cast wherever he stands\nStacks of green paper in his red right hand\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 4]\nYou'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams\nHe'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems\nYou'll see him in your head and on the TV screen\nHey, buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off\nHe's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru\n[Chorus]\nYou're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan\nDesigned and directed by his red right hand"
