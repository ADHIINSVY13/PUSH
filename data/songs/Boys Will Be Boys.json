  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down\nAnd put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around\nIsn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear\nWhen there's nothing funny here? (Ah)\nSick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out\nWe hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths\nWe smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south\nBut there's nothing funny now (Ah)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen will we stop saying things\n'Cause they're all listening?\nNo, the kids ain't alright\nOh, and they do what they see\n'Cause it's all on TV\nOh, the kids ain't alright\n[Chorus]\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say\nI know that there will be a man around to save the day\nAnd that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained\nI should've stuck to ballet (Ah)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen will we stop saying things\n'Cause they're all listening?\nNo, the kids ain't alright\nOh, and they do what they see\n'Cause it's all on TV\nOh, the kids ain't alright\n[Chorus]\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women\n[Bridge]\nIf you're offended by this song\nYou're clearly doing something wrong\nIf you're offended by this song\nThen you're probably saying\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen will we stop saying things\n'Cause they're all listening?\nNo, the kids ain't alright\nOh, and they do what they see\n'Cause it's all on TV\nOh, the kids ain't alright\n[Chorus]\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women\nBoys will be, boys will be\nBoys will be, boys will be boys\nBut girls will be women"
