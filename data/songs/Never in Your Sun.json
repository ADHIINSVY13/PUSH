  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI met her at lover's park\nOne rainy April Monday\nSmiling soft and warm as on\nA clear December Sunday\nWearing taffeta and lace\nThat matched her braided hair\nWith their coraled beads that sang to me\nShe said \"hi\" and asked me why\nWas I looking with sorrow\nWhen there were much brighter days\nIn store for me tomorrow\nI looked\n up at her and smiled\nAnd said, why I don't know\nBut would she agree, to stay with me\nAnd she said\n[Chorus]\nNever in your sun, she said\nNever in your sun, then she said\nI will only come\nIn your pouring rain to relieve the pain\n[Harmonica solo]\n[Verse 2]\nSo if you are at lover's park\nAnd someone looks with sorrow\nAsk them why are they so sad\nWhen sunshine's theirs tomorrow\nThey'll reply they don't know why\nAnd ask you please to stay\nUntil the end of time, and when they're fine\n\n[Outro]\nBe kind and say\nNever in your sun, just tell them\nNever in your sun, then say\nI will only come\nIn your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever\nNever in your sun, never in your sun, believe that\nI will only come\nIn your pouring rain to relieve the pain"
