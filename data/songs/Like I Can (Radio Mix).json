  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe could be a sinner or a gentleman\nHe could be a preacher when your soul is damned\nHe could be a lawyer on a witness stand\nBut he'll never love you like I can, can\nHe could be a stranger you gave a second glance\nHe could be a trophy of a one night stand\nHe could have your humour, but I don't understand\n'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can\n[Chorus]\nWhy are you looking down all the wrong roads?\nWhen mine is the heart and the salt of the soul\nThere may be lovers who hold out their hands\nBut they’ll never love you like I can, can, can\nThey'll never love you like I can, can\n[Verse 2]\nA chance encounter of circumstance\nBaby, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced\nHe could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again\nHe’ll never love you like I can, can, can\n[Chorus]\nWhy are you looking down all the wrong roads?\nWhen mine is the heart and the salt of the soul\nThere may be lovers who hold out their hands\nBut they’ll never love you like I can, can, can\nThey'll never love you like I can, can, can\nThey'll never love you like I can, can, can\n\n[Bridge]\nWe both have demons that we can't stand\nI love your demons like devils can\nIf you're self-seeking, an honest man\nThen stop deceiving, Lord, please\n[Chorus]\nWhy are you looking down all the wrong roads?\nWhen mine is the heart and the salt of the soul\nThere may be lovers who hold out their hands\nBut they’ll never love you like I can, can, can (Oh, like I can)\nThey'll never love you like I can, can, can\nHe'll never love you like I can, can, can"
