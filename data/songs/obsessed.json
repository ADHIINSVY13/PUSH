Is she good in bed?\nDo you think about her? No, I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me\nIs she easy-going? Never controlling?\nWell-traveled? Well-read? Oh, God, she makes me so upset\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)\nShe's been asleep on my side of your bed (Ah), woah\nI'm so obsessed with your ex (God, she makes me so upset)\nI'm so obsessed with your, with your ex"
