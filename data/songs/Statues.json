  "lyrics": "“Statues” has rings of existential crisis. It’s about two people that soon, both of them will die out and fade away, only being remembered as objects. It’s a bit grim, but for most, it’s true.\n[Verse 1]\nYou and I were two old and tortured souls\nRepaired by a love of broken things\nIn a life, just some bodies growin' old\nNo fear of the end, of anything\n[Chorus]\nWe're just ordinary people, you and me\nTime will turn us into statues, eventually\n[Verse 2]\nWe got by, though we never needed much\nA sliver of hope, no diamond rings\nWe got high, it was heaven, it was hell\nFlyin' over them, with broken wings\n[Chorus]\nWe're just ordinary people, you and me\nTime will turn us into statues, eventually\n(Oh-oh)\nJust two ordinary people, you and me\nTime will turn us into statues, eventually\n[Bridge]\nOur bones forever in stone\nMonuments of life\nTo dust, as everything must\nFade away in time, oh-oh-oh-oh\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nWe're just ordinary people, you and me\nTime will turn us into statues, eventually\n(Oh-oh)\nJust two ordinary people, you and me\n(Oh-oh)\nTime will turn us into statues, eventually"
