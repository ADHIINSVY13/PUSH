Whatâ€™s the point?\n\nMatt Bellamy\n[Refrain]\nParadise comes at a price\nThat I am not prepared to pay\nWhat were we built for?\nCould someone tell me please?\n[Verse 1]\nThe good news is she can't have babies\nAnd won't accept gifts from me\nWhat are they for? They'll just grow up\nAnd break the laws you've loved\n[Chorus]\nTake off your disguise\nI know that underneath it's me, ooh\n[Post-Chorus]\nWho are you?\nOoh\n[Verse 2]\nUseless device, it won't suffice\nI want a new game to play\nWhen I am gone, it won't be long\nBefore I disturb you in the dark\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd paradise comes at a price\nThat I am not prepared to pay\nWhat were we built for?\nWill someone tell me please?\n[Chorus]\nTake off your disguise\nI know that underneath it's me\n[Outro]\nWoah, oh\nHuh, huh"
