I was born to boogie\nPeople, I was born... said I was born to boogie\nCome on boogie now\nEverybody born to boogie\nEvery little person born to boogie\nEven our old people should boogie\nI'm gonna boogie\nEvery roadie should boogie\nEvery grandmother should boogie\nI think the Pope could boogie... he got soul\nI said the Pope's got soul\nThe Pope got soul"
