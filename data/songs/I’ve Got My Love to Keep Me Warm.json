  "lyrics": "The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing\nBut I will weather the storm\nWhat do I care how much it may storm\nI've got my love to keep me warm\nI can't remember a worst December\nJust you watch those icicles fall\nWhat do I care if those icicles fall\nI've got my love to keep me warm\nOff with my overcoat, off with my glove\nWho needs an overcoat I'm burning with love\nMy heart's on fire and the fire gets higher\nSo I will weather the storm\nWhat do I care how much it may storm\nI've got my love to keep me warm"
