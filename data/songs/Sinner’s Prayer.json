  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI came down the mountain\nDraggin' our love affair\nPut on a pretty little number\nI'm wearing you still\nIt was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast\nNobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me\nHe has a funny way sayin' forever too fast\nDon't get mad, can't blame a tramp\nFor somethin' he don't have\nI get on my knees and beg you\n[Chorus]\nHear my sinner's prayer\nI am what I am\nAnd I don't wanna break the heart of any other man\nBut you, but you\nOh, hear my sinner's prayer\nIt's the only one I know\nIt sure as hell don't rhyme\nBut it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold\n[Verse 2]\nGot a baby sister who looks just like me\nShe wants nothin' more than a man to please\nMaybe she's in too deep\nHer love for him ain't cheap\nBut it breaks just like a knockoff piece\nFrom Fulton Street\nThe man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants\nHe's thirsty when he drinks\nGets on the brink, and throws her off\nI get on my knees and beg you\n\n[Chorus]\nHear my sinner's prayer\nI am what I am\nAnd I don't wanna break the heart of any other man\nBut you, but you\nOh, hear my sinner's prayer\nIt's the only one I know\nIt sure as hell don't rhyme\nBut it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold\nGood as, good as, good as, good as gold\n[Bridge]\nI can carry you, but not your ghosts\nWish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh\n[Chorus]\nHear my sinner's prayer\nI am what I am\nAnd I don't wanna break the heart of any other man\nBut you, but you\nOh, hear my sinner's prayer\nIt's the only one I know\nIt sure as hell don't rhyme\nBut it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold\nGood as, good as, good as, good as gold\nGood as, good as, good as, good as gold"
