We cray, too\nYou pray? We pray, too\nNever too late for Him to save you\nThis your movie 'cause no one can play you\nDevil, lay down, Devil, lay down\nThis that level, make devils pray now\n \n(\nHeaven and Hell\n)\nHold up, no peace, hold up, police\nDon't call police, just stay focused\n \n(\nIs on Earth\n)\nPray for new life, pray for new breath\nHey, Lord, make sure it's safe for who's left\n \n(\nHeaven and Hell\n)\nKnow you can't find a place to rest\nKnow the Lord my bulletproof vest\n \n(\nIs on Earth\n)\nWhen we survive, know that we blessed\nSave my people through the music\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nLet it grrat, let it grrat, grrat\nLet it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat\nLet it grrat, grrat, grrat\nLet it grrat, let it grrat, grrat\nLet it grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat, grrat\nLet it grrat"
