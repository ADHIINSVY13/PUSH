I go round and around\nThinking about it all the time\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI gave you heaven on a platter, baby\nI gave you everything you never gave me\nI never lied and I never faked it\nOnly wanted for you to save me\nThis love, it ain't over yet\nThere's too much that I haven't said\n[Chorus]\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\nIt was hard to write with a lump in my throat\nDo you even know that I can't let go?\n[Verse 2]\nWhy were you so cold? Let the truth be told\nTell me, was it all for the thrill?\nWhat was I thinking? I gave you everything\nBut you still went for the kill\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI gave you heaven on a platter, baby\nI gave you everything you never gave me\nI never lied and I never faked it\nOnly wanted for you to save me\n[Chorus]\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\nIt was hard to write with a lump in my throat\nDo you even know that I can't let go?\n[Bridge]\nOoh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark\nOoh, I thought I'd die in your arms\n[Chorus]\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\nIt was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat\nDo you even know that I can't let go?\n[Outro]\nHope you know, I won't let go"
