Another day, the same shit\nPunk-ass C.O.'s on a nigga dick\nGot me up at three o'clock, cookin eggs n' grits\nI'm a G from C.P., I can't take the shit\nTryin' to hold a nigga down in this country ass town\nI'm used to smokin' chronic, movin' pounds\nThey got a nigga on some \"Sir, yessir\" \"Left, right, left\"\nThrow me in the hole if my ass outta step\nThey treat you like a motherfuckin' slave\nDope fiends find Jesus, swear they saved\nNiggas better get they game tight\n'Cause these crackers tryin' to take a nigga life and they rights\nI'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks\nThey swear they kingpins, but don't have money on they books\nI hear so many lies, it make me sick\nThese niggas called ballers, sellin' dimes and nicks\nI can't wait ;til the day they let me go\nSo I can eat some steak and shrimp\nGrab a mic, and bust a flow\nI'm Audi 5, nigga â€“ lights out\nHold it down on the streets until the day that I get out\n\n[Outro: Nathaniel]\nI'm out, man"
