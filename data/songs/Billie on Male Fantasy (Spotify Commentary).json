  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"Male Fantasy\" 's really... a hopeless realization? And a... horrible thing [laughs]. It's terrible to feel... something that you don't want to feel. \"Happier Than Ever\" was actually gonna close the album, and then we wrote \"Male Fantasy\", and it actually... felt better to close it with that. You know, not ending on a... angry note, I think, was important, 'cause nothing shoud end on a bad note, I feel like."
