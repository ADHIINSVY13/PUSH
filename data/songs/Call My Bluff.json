Cole's\nBut dope boys gotta be the man like they know\nHow many more car faxes must get exposed?\nImaginary shipments, fictitious payloads\nYou should listen to them on the platforms they on\nThe villains, the killings, no ceilings, I yawn\nNiggas acting like we can't pop up, hey Yawn\nWe specialize in not getting locked up, Akon\n\"Ahaha, I don't feel like they get that!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything don't need to be addressed\nThe pull-up's like a FedEx truck\nI can send some niggas 'round there right now\n1-800 Call-My-Bluff\nWake your ass up where you rest\nOn time like a Amazon truck\nI can send some niggas 'round there right now\n1-800 Call-My-Bluff"
