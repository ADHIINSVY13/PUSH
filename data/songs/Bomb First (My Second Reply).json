Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to \nassassinate the character of not only \nMr. Shakur but of Death Row Records\n as well.\n \nNas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's\n – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on \nMobb Sleep,\n \nNotorious P.I.G.,\n and several other New York rappers. \nJAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame\n, \nBig Little whatever,\n and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers\n \nare understandably shaken up by this release.\n The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? \n2Pac – rather Makaveli –\n was not available for comment but released this statement:\n[Spoken: 2Pac]\nIt's not about East or West\nIt's about niggas and bitches\nPower and money, ridaz and punks\nWhich side are you on?\n*\nHeartbeat\n* *\nGunshots\n*\n*\nEncroaching footsteps\n*\nThese niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?\nYou niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches\nA'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches\nPunk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)\nKilluminati Style (All day) (Up in your ass)\n(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nAllow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don\nHysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an\nNiggas get shook like 5-0\nMy .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival\nMoney-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets\nLet me introduce the topic, then we drop it\nExpose snakes ‘cause they breed freely\nSee me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti\nI think I'm tougher than Nitti\n, my attitude is shitty\nBorn on a dope fiend's titty\n, huh, in every city\nYou'll find me, look for trouble right behind me\nMy Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nah'mean?\nI hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare\nI'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare\nGet me high, let me see the sun rise and fall\nThis for my dogs, down to die for y'all\nExtreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em\nCut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em\nMy whole team trained to explode, ride or die\nMurder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gon' cry\nMe, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater\nTwo big pits, I call them \"my bitch-nigga eaters\"\nAnd not a whimper until I'm gone\nThug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong\nBye, bye, bye, let's get high and ride\nOh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gon' cry\nI'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too\nLookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you\nWeak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe\nHow many niggas down to die for me?
