  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe've been together for a while now\nWe're growing stronger every day now\nIt feels so good and there's no doubt\nI will stay with you as each morning brings sunrise\nAnd the flowers bloom in springtime\nOn my love that you can rely\nAnd I'll stay with you\n[Chorus]\nOh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs\nOh I will stay with you when no one else is around\nAnd when the dark clouds arrive\nI will stay by your side\nI know we'll be alright\nI will stay with you\n[Verse 2]\nThough relationships can get old\nThey have the tendency to grow cold\nWe have something like a miracle\nYeah, and I'll stay with you\n[Chorus]\nOh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs\nYes I will stay with you when no one else is around\nAnd when the dark clouds arrive\nI will stay by your side\nI know we'll be alright\nI will stay with you\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd there'll be heartaches and pains, yes it will\nBut through it all, we will remain\nIn this life, we all know\nFriends may come, and they may go\nThrough the years I know\nI will stay\nAnd in the end I know that we'll find\nLove so beautiful and divine\nAnd we'll be lovers for a lifetime, yeah\nAnd I'll stay with you\n[Chorus]\nOh I will stay with you through the ups and the downs\nYes I will stay with you when no one else is around\nAnd when the dark clouds arrive\nI will stay by your side\nI know we'll be alright\nI will stay with you"
