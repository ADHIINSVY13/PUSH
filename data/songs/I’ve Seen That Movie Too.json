  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can see by your eyes you must be lying\nWhen you think I don't have a clue\nBaby, you're crazy\nIf you think that you can fool me\nBecause I've seen that movie too\n[Verse 2]\nThe one where the players are acting surprised\nSaying love's just a four letter word\nBetween forcing smiles\nWith the knives in their eyes\nWell, their actions become so absurd\n[Chorus]\nSo keep your auditions for somebody\nWho hasn't got so much to lose\n'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting\nThat I've seen that movie too\nSo keep your auditions for somebody\nWho hasn't got so much to lose\n'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting\nI've seen that movie too\n[Verse 3]\nIt's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around\nStop twinkling your star like you do\nI'm not the blueprint\nFor all of your B-films\nBecause I've seen that movie too\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe one where the players are acting surprised\nSaying love's just a four letter word\nBetween forcing smiles\nOh, with the knives in their eyes\nOh, their actions become so absurd\n[Chorus]\nSo keep your auditions for somebody\nWho hasn't got so much to lose\n'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting\nThat I've seen that movie too\nSo keep your auditions for somebody\nWho hasn't got so much to lose\n'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting\nI've seen that movie too\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nSo keep your auditions for somebody\nWho hasn't got so much to lose\n'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting\nI've seen that movie too\nSo keep your auditions for somebody\nWho hasn't got so much to lose\n'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting\nI've seen that movie too"
