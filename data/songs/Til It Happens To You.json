What do you know?\nTell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?\n[Chorus 1]\n'Til It happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels\n'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real\nNo, it won't be real, won't know how it feels\n[Verse 2]\nYou tell me hold your head up, hold your head up and be strong\n'Cause when you fall you gotta get up, you gotta get up and move on\nTell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?\n'Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke\n[Chorus 2]\n'Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels\n'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real\n(How could you know?)\nNo it won't be real\n(How could you know?)\nWon't know how I feel\n[Bridge]\n'Til your world burns and crashes\n'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope\n'Til you're standing in my shoes\nI don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you\n'Cause you don't know\n\n[Chorus 3]\n'Til it happens to you, you don't know how I feel, how I feel\nHow I feel\n'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real\n(How could you know?)\nNo it won't be real\n(How could you know?)\nWon't know how it feels\n[Outro]\n'Til it happens to you\nHappens to you\nHappens to you\nHappens to you\nHappens to you\nHappens to you\n(How could you know?)\n'Til it happens you\nYou won't know how I feel"
