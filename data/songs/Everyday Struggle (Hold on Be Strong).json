I'm tryin' for it\nAnd until then, I have to make the life that I do live\nAs happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have\nDo.. you know, live the best life I can live\nBe as happy as I can be... nothing is perfect for anybody\nI don't think\nThug for life, feel me? (That's right)\nI know it seems hard sometimes, but, uh, remember one thing\nTo every dark night, there's a bright day after that\nAll my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong\nWhen things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth\nStay strong and stay ballin'\nSo no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out, keep your head up and handle it!\nHold on, I'll catch y'all up at the next life\nWe're in traffic\nAy, do this thug style, man, thug style\nWhen this whole beat drop, we just gon' run it to 'em, bet\nIt's all good, uhh\n[Verse 1]\nI never had much, ran with a bad bunch\nLittle skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch\nAnd all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by\nAnd driveby's robbed my homies of their young lives\nI never did cry, and even though I had\nPain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start\nThey couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me\nThe marijuana had my mind gone, it wasn't healthy\nI travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year\nI felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here\nNever did like the police, let the whole world know\nNow I gets no peace, 'cause they chasin' me down\nAnd facing me now, what do I do?\nThese thangs that a Thug goes through\nAnd still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong\nIt's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\n[Verse 2]\nThere's, never a good day, 'cause in my hood they\nLet they AK's pump strays where the kids play\nAnd every Halloween, check out the murder scene\nCan't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen\nMy homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays\nThese is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray\nAnd even God turned his back on the ghetto youth\nI know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof\nI wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does\nDoes it matter if you blood or you cuz\nRemember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects\nSmall time drinkin', getting high with them armies\nJust another knucklehead kid from the gutter\nI'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother\nI'm tryin' to tell you when it's on\nYou gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\n[Interlude]\nI know them ain't tears coming down your face\nWipe your eyes\nIn this world, only the strong survive, y'know\nHmm, I know it's hard out there\nWelfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, carjackings\nYeah, we got problems\nBut believe me when I tell you, \nthings always get better\nGod don't like ugly\n and God don't like no quitters\nYou know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee\nGod bless the child that can hold his own\nY'know? You got to stand strong\nAnd when these busters try to knock you out your place\nYou stand there to they face and tell 'em \"Hold on, and be strong\"\nThe game don't stop, hmmm\nThis here is Black Man\nIf you don't never learn nothin', learn one thing\nIt don't stop, till the casket drop\n\n[Outro]\nOur lives begin to end the day that we become silent about the things that matter"
