I'm still alive.\"\n[Chorus]\nWe should be on by now\nWe should be on by now\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou - Are not a victim\nYou - Just scream with boredom!\nYou - Are not evicting time...\n[Bowie breathing heavily]\nChimes - Goddamn, you're looking old\nYou'll freeze and catch a cold\n'Cause you've left your coat behind\nTake your time\nBreaking up is hard\nBut keeping dark is hateful\nI had so many dreams\nI had so many breakthroughs\nBut you, my love, were kind\nBut love has left you dreamless\nThe door to dreams was closed\nYour park was real and dreamless\nPerhaps you're smiling now\nSmiling through this darkness\nBut all I have to give\nIs guilt for dreaming\n[Chorus]\nWe should be on by now\nWe should be on by now\nWe should be on by now\nWe should be on by now\nWe should be on by now\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLi, li, li, li, li, li, li, li\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, yes, time!"
