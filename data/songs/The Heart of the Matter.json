  "lyrics": "I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear\nBut I knew that it would come\nAn old \ntrue\n friend of ours was talkin' on the phone\nShe said you found someone\nAnd I thought of all the bad luck\nAnd the struggles we went through\nAnd how I lost me and you lost you\nWhat are these voices outside love's open door\nMake us throw off our contentment\nAnd beg for something more?\nI'm learning to live without you now\nBut I miss you sometimes\nThe more I know, the less I understand\nAll the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again\nI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter\nBut my will gets weak\nAnd my thoughts seem to scatter\nBut I think it's about forgiveness\nForgiveness\nEven if, even if you don't love me anymore\nThese times are so uncertain\nThere's a yearning undefined\n... People filled with rage\nWe all need a little tenderness\nHow can love survive in such a \ngraceless\n age\nThe trust and self-assurance that can lead to happiness\nThey're the very things we kill, I guess\nPride and competition cannot fill these empty arms\nAnd the work I put between us\nDoesn't keep me warm\n\nI'm learning to live without you now\nBut I miss you, Baby\nThe more I know, the less I understand\nAll the things I thought I figured out, I have to learn again\nI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter\nBut everything changes\nAnd my friends seem to scatter\nBut I think it's about forgiveness\nForgiveness\nEven if, even if you don't love me anymore\nThere are people in your life who've come and gone\nThey let you down and hurt your pride\nBetter put it all behind you; life goes on\nYou keep carrin' that anger, it'll eat you inside\nI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter\nBut my will gets weak\nAnd my thoughts seem to scatter\nBut I think it's about forgiveness\nForgiveness\nEven if, even if you don't love me anymore\nI've been tryin' to get down to the Heart of the Matter\nBecause the flesh will get weak\nAnd the ashes will scatter\nSo I'm thinkin' about forgiveness\nForgiveness\nEven if, even if you don't love me anymore"
