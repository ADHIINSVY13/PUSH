Her and I were ****\nSo pure and ****, so spirit spinning and dirty\nSo on, so on, and so on, we hoped that no one heard us\nSh-sh, ah, ah\nAnd to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore\nMiss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him why he never married\nAlways smiled, but was he happy inside?\nBecause I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?\nI'm sure she did it out of spite, 'twas her decision at birth\nShit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby\nTwo young people with different views, a lot for a young lady\nNo coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions\nThere's a dissidence at play, dad and mom do hard division\nThree Thou', poster child for big **** **** raised by their mothers\nI'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled\nKeeps me around, for what? I don't know\nBut I do know that it's crucial, that we do so, pronto\nI don't know how much long though\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West, \nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n & \nDiddy\n]\nStraight from Shibuya, on some zen\nWe back, ramped up, we on ten\nIt's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win\nJust like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (\nC'mon\n)\nPut the whole family on, look at what my Kim did\nJust like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (\nUh\n)\nWe gon' win big (\nWhat?\n)\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nSouthside gang mentality weigh heavy\nI was thinkin' out the box even in a Box Chevy\nAnd my favorite art teacher name was Mrs. Levy\n'Round the time, I learned to put my feelings to a medley (\nThe life of the party\n)\nI ain’t turn in homework for like four months and I bet she let me\nShe saw the vision\n\"Yeezy you special, go make your own decisions then\"\nMan, that was a good choice, faith driving us like a Rolls Royce\nThey tried to take my voice away, I ain't try to take ya choice away\nI just prayed the water break, just for my daughter sake, from a slip-up\nFake signatures from fake managers, it all damage ya, good Lord\nGive 'em enough of they own rope to hang 'em with\nThe paparazzi never really got what my angle is\nThey treat my married life like some type of entanglement\nMy neighbor still dissin', wonderin' why I ain't sayin' it\nI can smell the setup, that's that 2Pac in Vegas hit\nI revealed myself and some don't know what to make of it\nGod has said himself to make sure that the baby live\nAnd if Ye ain't here, then tell me who gonna say this here?\nWait a minute, wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute\nLet me stop playing with it, hopped in a Lamb' with it\nHopped in a Lamb' with it, in a damn pandemic\nNerve of Uncle Sam gotta have his damn hand in it\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West, \nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n & \nDiddy\n]\nListen, straight from Shibuya, on some zen\nI'm on ten, it's a marathon and look, we comin' for the win\nJust like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (\nC'mon\n)\nPut the whole family on, look at what my Kim did\nJust like Puff told Christopher, we gon' win big (\nUh\n)\nWe gon' win big (\nWhat?\n)\n[Bridge: Kanye West]\nDo y'all feel me?
