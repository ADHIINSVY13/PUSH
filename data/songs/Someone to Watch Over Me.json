  "lyrics": "There's is a saying, oh love is blind\nStill we're often told, \"seek and ye shall find\"\nSo i'm going to seek a certain man that i've had in mind\nWon't you tell him please to put on some speed\nFollow my lead, oh how i need\nSomeone, someone to watch over me\nThere's a somebody I'm longin' to see\nI hope that he, turns out to be\nSomeone to watch over me\nI'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood\nI know i could, always be good\nTo one who'll watch over me\nAlthough he may not be the man some\nGirls think of as handsome\nTo my heart he carries the key\nWon't you tell him please to put on some speed\nFollow my lead, oh, how i need\nSomeone to watch over me\nWon't you tell him please to put on some speed\nFollow my lead, oh, how i need\nSomeone to watch over me\n\nSomeone to watch over me"
