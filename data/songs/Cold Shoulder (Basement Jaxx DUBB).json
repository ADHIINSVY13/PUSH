  "lyrics": "You say it's all in my head\nAnd the things I think just don't make sense\nSo where you been then? Don't go all coy\nDon't turn it round on me like it's my fault\nSee I can see that look in your eyes\nThe one that shoots me each and every time\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nThese days, when I see you\nYou make it look like I'm see-through\nDo tell mе why you waste our time\nWhen your hеart ain't admitting you're not satisfied\nYou know I know just how you feel\nI'm starting to find myself feeling that way too\nWhen you grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\n\nTime and time again I'll play the role of fools (just for you)\nEven in the daylight when you're dreaming (I'm close to you)\nTry to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\nEven though I do know how you play\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her"
