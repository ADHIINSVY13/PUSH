(Why won't you cry?)\nThis is just telling me you took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies\nAnd baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you drive me up the wall and down\n[Verse 1]\nBoy, I'm lookin' at you, don't walk away\nComin' home at like two, then four, then eight\nBoy, you lookin' like you don't know my name\nEvery day you wanna butter me up then you're pushin' me out the way\n (Yeah)\nNow you wanna be a bad boy, papa\nYou ain't a man, you're just a handsome knock-off\nI saw you sneakin', tryna plant one on her\nOh, you mad all the sudden 'cause your man got my number?\n (Yeah)\nI wish you saw what I saw in you\nNever opened that door to you\n and gave it all to you\nHow the fuck I wasn't on to you?\nAnd it's a round of applause, but I'm warnin' you\n, \nboo\n[Chorus]\nWhere is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? (Why won't you cry?)\nThis is just telling me you took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies\nAnd baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you drive me up the wall and down\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe I'm a toy 'til you wind me\nI'll be on the run 'til you find me\nBad thing, I don't want a bad mind, me\nCan't wait 'til you realize, finally\nBig mouth but the steam on tiny\nI been seein' everything unwinding\nAnd I bought you all your chains in a fistful\nRollie dead on your wrist, untimely\nBaby, need somebody to trust in me\nNeed somebody to love on me, baby, baby, oh\nLow-key I love it when you talk to me\nBut I don't wanna be your one-night thing\nOh, help me, can we? Oh\n[Chorus]\nWhere is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? (Why won't you cry?)\nThis is just telling me you took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies\nAnd baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride\nAnd baby, you drive me up the wall and down"
