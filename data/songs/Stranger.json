Yeah\nDrunk on a Saturday night, mmm\nSuddenly your hand fits perfеctly in mine, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll my fears and all my thoughts\nYou see through, through it all\nKiss me now, and tell me why you're still here\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm no stranger to loving\nI'm no stranger to falling apart\nNo stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons\nI'm scared of the dark\nI'm no stranger to fighting\nI'm no stranger to playing with hearts\nNo stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons\nI'm scared of the dark\n[Bridge]\nSo leave the light on\nSo leave the light on\nSo leave the light on (on)\nSo leave the light on\nSo leave the light on\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm no stranger to loving\nI'm no stranger to falling apart\nNo stranger to secrets, and monsters, and demons\nI'm scared of the dark"
