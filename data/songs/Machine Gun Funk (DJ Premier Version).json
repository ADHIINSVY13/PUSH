  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah\n[Verse 1]\nSo you wanna be hardcore?\nWith your hat to the back, talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps\nBut I can't feel that hardcore\nAppeal that you're screamin', maybe I'm dreamin'\nThis ain't Christopher Williams\nStill some MC's gotta feel one, caps I gotta peel some\nTo let niggas know! (Let 'em know)\nThat if you fuck with Big and Heavy\nI get up in that ass like a wedgie\nSays who? Says me! The lyrical\nNiggas sayin', \"Biggie off the street, it's a miracle\"\nLeft the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me!\nJust for niggas actin' shifty\nSticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker\n'Specially when I'm drunk off the liquor\nSmokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks-es\nIt's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates\nThe funk, baby!\n[Chorus]\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll I want is bitches! Big booty bitches!\nUsed to sell crack so I could stack my riches\nNow I pack gats to stop all the snitches\nFrom stayin' in my business, what is this relentless\nApproach to know if I'm broke or not?\nJust 'cause I joke and smoke a lot, don't mean I don't tote the Glock\n16 shots for my niggas in the pen\nUntil we motherfuckin' meet again\nHuh! I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now\nCome on the Ave., I'm real hard to find now\n'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats\nIn the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats\nFor the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the ****\nI'll make you prove that it's bulletproof\nHold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks\nI got gin, mad blunts and bitches suckin' dick\nThe funk, baby!\n[Chorus]\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk (Uh)\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I guess you know the story â€” the rap side, crack side\nHow I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside\nBed-Stuy! The place where my head rests\nFifty-shot clip if a nigga wan' test\nThe rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya\nHigh as a motherfuckin' helicopter\nThat's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdemeanor\nBeatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina\n\"What's love got to do...\"\nWhen I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?\nStrapped like Bamboo, but I don't sling guns\nI got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons\nNiggas wanna know how I live the mack life!\nMakin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes!\nIt's type simple and plain to maintain\nI add a little funk to the brain\nThe funk, baby!\n[Chorus]\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"
