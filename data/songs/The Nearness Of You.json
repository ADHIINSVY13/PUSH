  "lyrics": "It's not the pale moon that excites me, that thrills and delights me\nOh no, it's just the nearness of you\nIsn't your sweet conversation that brings this sensation\nOh no, it's just the nearness of you\nWhen I'm in your arms and I feel you so close to me\nAll my wondrous dreams come true\nI need no soft lights to enchant me if you only grant me the right\nTo hold you ever so tight and to feel in the night, the nearness of you\nI need no soft lights to enchant me if you will only grant me the right\nTo hold you ever so tight and to feel in the night, the nearness of you"
