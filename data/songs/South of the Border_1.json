  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSouth of the border, down Mexico way\nThat's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play\nAnd now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray\nSouth of the border, down Mexico way\n[Verse 2]\nShe was a picture in old Spanish lace\nJust for a tender while, I kissed the smile apon her face\n'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay\nSouth of the border, Mexico way\n[Verse 3]\nThen she sighed as she whispered \"mañana\"\nNever dreaming that we were parting\nAnd I lied as a whispered \"mañana\"\n'Cause our tomorrow never came\n[Verse 4]\nSouth of the border, I jumped back one day\nThere in a veil of white by the candlelight, she knelt to pray\nThe mission bells told me that I mustn't stay\nSouth of the border, Mexico way\n[Outro]\nThe mission bells told me, ding-dong, that I must not stay\nStay south of the border, down Mexico way\nAye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)\nAye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)\nAye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)\nAye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)"
