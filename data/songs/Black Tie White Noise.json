Sure! & \nBacking Vocalists\n]\nGetting my facts from a Benetton ad\nLooking through African eyes\nLit by the glare of an L.A. fire\n (\nBlack tie, white noise\n)\nI've got a face, not just my race\n, bang bang\nI've got you, babe\n[Refrain: \nBacking Vocalists\n & David Bowie]\nPutting on the black tie\nCranking out the white noise\n[Verse 2: David Bowie & \nBacking Vocalists\n]\nSun comes up and the man goes down\nWoman comes again\nJust an hour or so to be safe from fear (Black tie, white noise)\nThen we jump through hoops, we're divisible now\nJust disappear\n[Refrain: \nBacking Vocalists\n & David Bowie]\nPutting on the black tie\nCranking out the white noise\n\n[Chorus: David Bowie & \nAl B. Sure!\n]\nWe reach out over race and hold each other's hands\nThen die in the flames singing \"We Shall Overcome\"\nWhat's going on?\nThere'll be some blood, no doubt about it\nBut we'll come through, don't doubt it\nI look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you\nI look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me\nYou won't kill me\nYou won't kill me, no\nBut I look into your eyes and I wonder sometimes\n[Refrain: \nBacking Vocalists\n & David Bowie]\nPutting on the black tie\nCranking out the white noise\n[Bridge: David Bowie & \nAl B. Sure!\n]\nOh Lord, just let him see me\nLord, Lordy, let him hear me\nLet him call me brother\nLet him put his arms around me\nLet him put his hands together\n[Chorus: David Bowie & \nAl B. Sure!\n]\nReach out over race and hold each other's hands\nWalk through the night thinking \n\"We Are the World\"\nWhat's going on?\nThere will be some blood, no doubt about it\nWe shall come through, don't doubt it\nI look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you\nAnd I turn my back for I know you won't kill me\nYou won't kill me\nYou won't kill me, no\nBut I wonder why\nYes, I wonder why sometimes\n\n[Refrain: \nBacking Vocalists\n & David Bowie]\nPutting on the black tie\nCranking out the white noise\n[Verse 3: David Bowie & \nBacking Vocalists\n]\nThey'll show us how to break the rules\nBut never how to make the rules\nReduce us down to witless punks\n(Black tie, white noise)\nFascist cries, both black and white\nWho's got the blood? Who's got the gun?\n[Refrain: \nBacking Vocalists\n & David Bowie]\nPutting on the black tie\nCranking out the white noise\n[Outro: David Bowie & \nBacking Vocalists\n]\nCranking out\nCranking out\nCranking out white noise\nCranking out\nCranking out\nPutting on the black tie\nCranking out the white noise"
