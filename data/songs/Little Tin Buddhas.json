  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat is your angle\nWell I hear your [view?]\nI know that you whisper with\nThe minds that think like you\nA mystery lived and breathed\nFrom the day that I could see\nEven I've no concept\nOf the rage inside of me\n[Bridge]\nSweet as the comfort of my\nEverlasting peace\nKnow about religion\nJust me and my beliefs\nI was my [light?]\nAnd now I am my [word/world?]\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've no desire to share my life\nWith little tin buddhas\n[Verse 2]\nAsk me your questions\nTake me as you will\nNo thought can be sacred now\nSo sacrifice your kill\nI see more fear in you\nThan I breed within myself\nDo you possess existence\nAnd call it something else?\n\n[Bridge]\nSweet as the comfort of my\nRealizing [well?]\nA misguided trust\nOf those who are not\nOf this world\nI was my [light?]\nAnd now I am my [world?]\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've no desire to share my life\nWith little tin buddhas\nAnd I've no desire to share my life\nWith little tin buddhas"
