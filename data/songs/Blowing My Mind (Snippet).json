The title has yet to be confirmed.\nSnippet\nI wanna feel your body moving next to mine\nI know I might say strange things\n'Cause I'm nervous when we talk\nIsn't that funny?\n'Cause I'm usually not\nBut something 'bout you\nGot me losing my cool\nAm I playing to lose?\nGirl, just give me a sign\nYou got that impossible body\nYou got that something that I want\nGirl, you're blowing my mind\nGirl, you're blowing my mind\nYeah\nMy shirt was hanging from your shoulder\nIt's something 'bout you\nGot me losing my cool\nAm I playing to lose?\nJust give me a sign\n\nYou got that impossible body\nYou got that something that I want\nGirl, you're blowing my mind\nGirl, you're blowing my mind\nYeah\nMy shirt was hanging from your shoulder\nI swear I had a [?] night\nGirl, you're blowing my mind\nGirl, you're blowing my mind\nI never through that I'd fall in love with you\nWhen you text me I just don't know what to do\nWhen you're [?] I just want to sing the blues\nI won't ever ever get over you\nI won't ever ever get over you\n'Cause girl you're blowing my mind"
