  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can see very well\nThere's a boat on the reef with a broken back\nAnd I can see it very well\nThere's a joke and I know it very well\nIt's one of those that I told you long ago\nTake my word, I'm a madman, don't you know\n[Verse 2]\nOnce a fool had a good part in the play\nIf it's so would I still be here today?\nIt's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way\nThey think it's very funny everything I say\nGet a load of him, he's so insane\nYou better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain\n[Chorus]\nWe'll come again next Thursday afternoon\nThe in-laws hope they'll see you very soon\nBut is it in your conscience that you're after\nAnother glimpse of the madman across the water?\n[Verse 1]\nI can see very well\nThere's a boat on the reef with a broken back\nAnd I can see it very well\nThere's a joke and I know it very well\nIt's one of those that I told you long ago\nTake my word, I'm a madman, don't you know\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe ground's a long way down but I need more\nIs the nightmare black or are the windows painted?\nWill they come again next week, can my mind really take it?\n[Chorus]\nWe'll come again next Thursday afternoon\nThe in-laws hope they'll see you very soon\nBut is it in your conscience that you're after\nAnother glimpse of the madman across the water?"
