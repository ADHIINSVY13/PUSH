Heard that the feds got 'em\nI seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side\nGold Rolex, better check your peripheral\nIt's a full moon in the middle of the day\nGot them wolves out, rock a little Cartier\nGot the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade\nKnow a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday\nTell them young niggas grind 'fore you gon' knock someone down, \nif they gon' shoot, then shoot something\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'\nMan down over yonder, \nyoung came through holdin' on the cane like a drummer\nThey done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder\nNiggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder\nHoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja\nThe police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'\nTrue to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'\nNiggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nHad the Parkay jumpin' out the Pyrex\nHigh definition glass on my pinky finger\nNiggas swimmin' in the water, no paddle\nNiggas trying to walk in my shadow\nThe bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel\nTold the young nigga, \"Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella\"\nTold a young nigga, \"Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella\"\nYou can turn this off and I can kick it acapella\nWe work the Front Street, where Mama said, \"Don't go,\" we went there\nTrap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there\nShawty don't fuck with these folks, these niggas be tellin' these days, be tellin' these days\n[Chorus]\nKnown to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms\nAyy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em\nI seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side\nGold Rolex, better check your peripheral\nIt's a full moon in the middle of the day\nGot them wolves out, rock a little Cartier\nGot the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade\nKnow a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday\nTell them young niggas grind 'fore you gon' knock someone down, \nif they gon' shoot, then shoot something\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'\nMan down over yonder, young came through holdin' on the cane like a drummer\nThey done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder\nNiggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder\nHoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja\nThe police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'\nTrue to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'\nNiggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'\n\n[Outro]\nNiggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'\nKnown to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms\nAyy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em\nI seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side\nGold Rolex, better check your peripheral\nIt's a full moon in the middle of the day\nGot them wolves out, rock a little Cartier\nGot the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade\nKnow a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday"
