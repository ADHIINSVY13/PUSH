  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wasted my youth in my bedroom alone\nScared to live, am I ready to die? Relieve me of my phone\nWorld is sinking deeper, never been so eager to meet my maker\nBitch, throw me away\nBitch, I'm hollow\nNeck-deep in a bottle\nYeah, people struggle, do anything for a dollar\n1992 Chevy Impala swingin' through the block\nYeah, got a bag of blues tucked in my socks\nYeah\nFlorida boy came out of the mud\nI am the hurricane, I am the flood\nTo wash away everything that you might love\nWhere is the bud? Put that smokе in my lungs\nI'm numb\nNeedle in my vein take thе pain away\nFade away, \nfeeling like Kobe at game day\nI am the roaches that hide in your walls\nI am the Boogeyman under the bed\nWhen I creep and I crawl with that heater\nI am the silhouette of the crypt keeper\nGlock hot like it has a fever\nBaby Bone, bitch, I don't give a fuck about you either\nCancel cultures vultures on my dick\nAnother day, another feminist\nTelling me I'm a scumbag\nWorthless cum rag\nFuck boy just a disturbance\nWhen will I wake up and feel like I'm enough?\nI'm soul searching, dick-deep in a bourbon\nOpen up the curtains, can you see past the surface?\nI'm lookin' around and I can see the world hurting\nYeah, when will I wake up and feel like I'm not mush?\nI can smell my brain rot through the kush\nTook a tab of acid, turned into an octopus\nMiddle finger to the media like '04 George Bush\n\n[Chorus]\nCum rag, cum rag\nCum rag, cum rag\nCum rag, cum rag\nCum rag\n[Verse 2]\nFace to face with the reaper\nI'm wide awake, I taste the pain\nBlood rushing through my veins\nPanic episodes unfold, so many stories untold\nYou never know who got it out for you, this world is so cold\nYour worth is only measured on success\nFame, drugs, and sex, intellect is irrelevant\nGetting high off the medicine the government endorsed\nRiding on the back of high horses\nGoing off course, of course, I'm forced to show my hand\nThat bleeds, just plant the seed inside of me\nI know so many kids in need\nI hope to be the voice for those who lack the company\nSet me free, let me be who I am\nI’m sick of feeling like nobody understands\nUndermine my mind, now my ego is dead\nSeparate my soul from my body and head\n[Outro]\nYeah"
