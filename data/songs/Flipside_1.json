  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI tried to get high, but you wanted me low\nGood things are happening, but happening slow\nIt's some kind of mystery from long ago\nI finally know who I'm supposed to be\nMy mind was locked but I found the key\nHope it don't all slip away from me\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHard times, fine lines\nMoments pass by and I cry\nRewind, step behind\nIt's hard to find the flipside\n[Chorus]\nI can't stand when you tell me to get back\nIf we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?\n[Verse 2]\nYou saw your reflection all over the news\nYour temperature's well past a hundred and two\nPut the guns away, or we'll all gonna lose\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStand by, or take flight\nEat or throw your piece pie\nWalk on, or be mine\nMoments fly by and I cry\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't stand when you tell me to get back\nIf we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?\nI can't stand when you tell me to get back\nIf we're all free, then why does it seem we can't just be?"
