  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nSo much has happened, think of what we've done\nIn the time that the Earth has traveled 'round the Sun\nWinter, spring, summer, and we're back to fall\nWe've been together, hand-in-hand through it all\nFrom the minute we kissed and my heart skipped a beat\nTo the night that we danced, I was swept off my feet\nSure as every year has to come to an end\nI'd go spinnin' 'round the Sun with you\nAgain and again and again and again\n[Chorus]\nI think I kinda, you know\nI think I kinda, you know\nLike the way that we flow\nLike the way that we go\nAnd I love\nI think I kinda, you know\nI think I kinda, you know, you know, you know\n[Outro]\nI can't help dreamin' of you\nGuess I'm sayin' I don't not love you\nYou know, you know, you know"
