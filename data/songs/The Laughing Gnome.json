  "lyrics": "I was walking down the high street\nWhen I heard footsteps behind me\nAnd there was a little old man (Hello!)\nIn scarlet and gray, chuckling away\nWell, he trotted back to my house\nAnd he sat beside the telly (Ahh!)\nWith his tiny hands on his tummy\nChuckling away, laughing all day\n\"I ought to report you to the Gnome Office.\"\n\"Gnome Office? Ahahahah!\"\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\nI'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\nI'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me\nSaid the laughing gnome\nWell, I gave him roasted toadstools\nAnd a glass of dandelion wine. (*burp* Pardon...)\nThen I put him on a train to Eastbourne\nCarried his bag, and gave him \na fag\n\"\nHave you got a light\n, \nboy\n?\"\n\"Here, where do you come from?\"\n\"\nGnome-man's land\n, \nheehee!\"\n\"Oh, really?\"\n\nIn the morning, when I woke up\nHe was sitting on the edge of my bed\nWith his brother, whose name was Fred\nHe'd brought him along to sing me a song\n\"Alright, let's hear it... 'ere, what's that clicking noise?\"\n\"\nThat's Fred\n, he's a \nmetro-gnome\n, \nhaha!\"\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\nI'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\nI'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me\n\"Oh now, I'm a gnome, anyway, haha!\"\n\"Haven't you got a home to go to?\"\n\"No, we are \ngnome-ads\n, hehe!\"\n\"Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school?\nYou look like a \nrolling gnome\n.\"\n\"Nah, not at the \nLondon school of Eco-gnome-ics\n.\"\nNow they're staying up me chimney\nAnd we're living on caviar and honey (Hurray!)\n'Cause they're earning me lots of money\nWriting comedy prose for radio shows\n\"\nIt's the, errrr... it's the gnome-service, yes, of course\n!\"\n\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\nI'm a laughing gnome and you...\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\n(Oh, dear me...)\nI'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me\n(\nOne more time\n!)\nHa, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee\nI'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me"
