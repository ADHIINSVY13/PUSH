  "lyrics": "[Produced by J. Cole]\n[Intro: J. Cole & Nas]\nFreedom or jail, clips inserted\nA baby's bein' born, same time a man is murdered\nThe beginning and end\nAs far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain\nMy plateau, and also what defines my name\n[Refrain: J. Cole]\nYeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nPac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible\nNow what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin\nNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nI used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall\nMy niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw\nAnd since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe\nThen he dropped \nStillmatic\n, rocked the cleanest velour\nFast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour\nI'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore\nBackstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man\nWhen he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand\nNo time to soak up the moment though â€˜cause I was in a jam\nHov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and\nI was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear\nJeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career\nBut at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea\nDion called me when it dropped, soundin' sad but sincere\nTold me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit\nSaid, \"You the one, yo, why you make that shit?\"\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nI can't believe I let Nas down\nDamn, my heart sunk to my stomach\nI can't believe I let Nas down\nI got defensive on the phone\nResentment was in my tone, fuck it\n[Refrain: J. Cole]\nLong live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nPac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible\nNow what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin\nNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nI couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake\nI mean, you made \"You Owe Me\", dog, I thought that you could relate\nBut while I shot up the charts\nYou mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?\nGranted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on sayin', \"Where's the hits? You ain't got none\nYou know Jay'll never put your album out without none,\"\nAnd, dog, you know how come\nLabels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes, huh\nThey don't know, they just study the charts\nMe, I studied the shows, the fans, studied they hearts\nI had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out\nWould change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out\nFriday Night Lights\n blew, that was classic number two\nNow it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true\nStill no release date from the label, are they insane?\nGucc told me play the game to change the game\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nBut on the way I let Nas down\nDamn, I got no one to blame\nI'm ashamed, I let Nas down\nBut this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it\n[Refrain: J. Cole]\nLong live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nPac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible\nNow what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin\nNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin\n[Verse 3: J. Cole]\nI always believed in the bigger picture\nIf I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door\nReintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more\nThe difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars\nAnd so, I took the fall\nLike the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought\nFor the past decade\nIf I should pass, please let this be my last essay\nTherefore I write from the heart\nApologies to OGs for sacrificin' my art\nBut I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start\nI'm just a man of the people, not above but equal\nAnd for the greater good I walk amongst the evil\nDon't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself\nJust pray along the way that I don't lose myself\nThis is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead\nI went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?\n\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nLetting Nas down\nI got the phone call\nQuietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down\nYeah, and on this flight\nMay I never lose sight, fuck it\n[Refrain: J. Cole]\nLong live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nPac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible\nNow what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin\nNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin\nStory begin"
