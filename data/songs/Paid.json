Paid!\nTryna get paid\nTryna get paid\n[Hook: Jeremih]\nYou ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?\nI'm tryna get paid\nFuck what they say\nI don't need no faves\nAll I need is blue faces\nDead presidents, roll the same\nMovin' up, George Jefferson\nShoppin' sprees, I know you've never been\nAll these niggas hate\nHad to hit 'em with the wave\nFirst class, talkin' 1A\nFirst class, talkin' 1A\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nNew money, uh, blue hunnids, uh\nCold winters, uh, cruel summers, uh\nWe winners, uh, the crew of us\nIt's nothin' better than livin' it with your brothers\nNew wheels on deck, no chill, we flex\nNew chicks, we sex, who's up? We next\nIt's a race 'til the finish line\n'Til all my dogs eat like it's dinner time\nWe spend it on light toys, dodgin' them bike boys\nFlippin' them pill packs, dodgin' them bike boys\nWe know the risk and the payoff\nYou only live once, so we never take a day off\nWoo! \nChop shops are the small change\nSmall gun with a long range\nWith the molly, made our own lane\nWe just here to get paid, we just tryna get paid\n[Hook: Jeremih]\nYou ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?\nI'm tryna get paid\nFuck what they say\nI don't need no faves\nAll I need is blue faces\nDead presidents, roll the same\nMovin' up, George Jefferson\nShoppin' sprees, I know you've never been\nAll these niggas hate\nHad to hit 'em with the wave\nFirst class, talkin' 1A\nFirst class, talkin' 1A\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nRemember sleepin' on the rooftops?\nNow what I'm drivin' out, a roof drops\nNo more skatin' through my tube socks\nYoung wild niggas like the \nBoondocks\nThe treasure's inside of the trunk\nHelp mama with the first of the month\nBaby mama get to buy what she want\nBaby sister get to buy the free lunch\nIt goes down when the poverty's up, woo!\nSee the difference is, had to get it, no privilege\nHad to take it, no middle man\nJust divided up the dividends\nThat's drug dealer discipline, that's how you reel 'em in\nWoo! For that almighty dollar\nI make the whole gang follow\nThe only way to pop bottles\nYou gotta have the money and the power\nWe just tryna get paid\n[Hook: Jeremih]\nYou ain't talkin' 'bout the money, what you talkin' bout?\nI'm tryna get paid\nFuck what they say\nI don't need no faves\nAll I need is blue faces\nDead presidents, roll the same\nMovin' up, George Jefferson\nShoppin' sprees, I know you've never been\nAll these niggas hate\nHad to hit 'em with the wave\nFirst class, talkin' 1A\nFirst class, talkin' 1A"
