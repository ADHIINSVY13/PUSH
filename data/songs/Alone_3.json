  "lyrics": "Bonus track off Canadian pop star Justin Bieberâ€™s compilation album Journals.\n[Verse 1]\nWe were inseparable\nEverything I had to do, I did it next to you\nAnd the memories we made were so incredible\nThen our love was interrupted by my schedule\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere was nothing that I could do\nCause you fell into the deepest depression baby\nAnd I hate to know I'm responsible\nAnd your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to\n[Chorus]\nBeing alone, alone\nYou adapted, now you're used to\nBeing alone, all alone\nOoh you got used to being on your own\n[Verse 2]\nI saw it happening\nBut I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it\nThere was so much going on you couldn't handle it\nCould have divided my time, I should have rationed it\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere was nothing that I could do\nCause you fell into the deepest depression baby\nAnd I hate to know I'm responsible\nAnd your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to\n\n[Chorus]\nBeing alone, alone\nYou adapted, now you're used to\nBeing alone, all alone\nOoh you got used to being on your own"
