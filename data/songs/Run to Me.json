(to love me)\nRun to me if you need a shoulder\nNow and then, you need someone older\nSo darling, you run to me\n[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]\nAnd when you're out in the cold\nNo one beside you, and no one to hold\nAm I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?\n[Verse 4: Barry Gibb]\nAnd when you've got nothing to lose\nNothing to pay for, nothing to choose\nAm I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?\n\n[Chorus]\n[Chorus]\n[Chorus]"
