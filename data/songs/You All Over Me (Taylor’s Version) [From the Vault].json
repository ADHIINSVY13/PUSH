  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]\nOnce the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement\nShouldn't I find a stain? But I never do\nThe way the tires turn stones on old county roads\nThey leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you\nYou find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know\nYou can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be\nBut like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in\nYou can't change where it's been, reminds me of me\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]\nI lived and I learned\nHad you, got burned\nHeld out and held on\nGod knows, too long, and wasted time\nLost tears, swore that I'd get out of here\nBut no amount of freedom gets you clean\nI've still got you all over me\n[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, \nTaylor Swift & Maren Morris\n]\nThe best and worst day of June\nWas the one that I met you\nWith your \nhands in your pockets\nAnd your \"Don't you wish you had me?\" grin\nWell I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child\nNow, every breath of air I breathe \nreminds me of then\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]\nAnd I lived and I learned\nHad you, got burned\nHeld out and held on\nGod knows, too long, and wasted time\nLost tears, swore that I'd get out of here\nBut no amount of freedom gets you clean\nI've still got you all over me\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift, \nTaylor Swift & Maren Morris\n]\nI lived and I learned\nAnd found out what it was to turn around\nAnd see that we\nWere never really meant to be\nSo I lied, and I cried\nAnd I watched a part of myself die\n'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean\nI've still got you all over me\n[Outro: Taylor Swift, \nTaylor Swift & Maren Morris\n]\nI've still got \nyou all over me\nStill got you all over me"
