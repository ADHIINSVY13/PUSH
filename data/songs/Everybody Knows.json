(Don't know)\nThe radio's on, you're tuning me out\nI'm trying to speak, you're turning me down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy\nI still can't believe you've found somebody new\nBut I wish you the best, I guess\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nCause everybody knows, that nobody really knows\nHow to make it work, or how to ease the hurt\nWe've heard it all before\nThat everybody knows just how to make it right\nI wish we gave it one more try\nOne more try, One more try, One more try\nCause everybody knows, but nobody really knows\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nOh I wish you would understand\nJust an ordinary man\nI wish that we have known\nThat everybody knows, that nobody really knows\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy\nI still can't believe you've found somebody new\nBut I wish you the best, I guess\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nCause everybody knows, that nobody really knows\nHow to make it work, or how to ease the hurt\nWe've heard it all before\nThat everybody knows just how to make it right\nI wish we gave it one more try\nOne more try, One more try, One more try\nCause everybody knows, but nobody really knows"
