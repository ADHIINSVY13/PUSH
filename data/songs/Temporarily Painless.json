  "lyrics": "The ninth song off Darkness and Light is titled “Temporarily Painless.” In the song, John Legend describes meeting a stranger and sharing a painless night together as if they are lovers.\n[Verse 1]\nWe don't have to explain it\nThe beat is way too loud\nEven though the lights faded\nI still saw you in the crowd\nWhen I put you in my arm\nFeel it all through me\nWhen you promise me nothing\nYou give me everything I need\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe comes over\nWe're both not sober\nIt's like we're losing our minds\nWe kiss like lovers\nAnd Cupid hovers\nLike he's just learning to fly\nAnd even though it's dangerous\nIt's temporarily painless\nI'm falling for a stranger, stranger\n[Chorus]\nNo need to justify\nLooking for a little bit of love tonight\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nNo need to justify\nAll I wanna be is your drug tonight\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nI need somebody\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't even know what your name is\nWhen I taste your skin\nI don't wanna sound shameless\nI just wanna bring your body in\nWanna put you in my place\nPay to hear you scream\nYou don't even have to stay\nOh but I don't think you wanna leave\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe comes over\nWe're both not sober\nIt's like we're losing our minds\nWe kiss like lovers\nAnd Cupid hovers\nLike he's just learning to fly\nAnd even though it's dangerous\nIt's temporarily painless\nI'm falling for a stranger, stranger\n[Chorus]\nNo need to justify\nLooking for a little bit of love tonight\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nNo need to justify\nAll I wanna be is your drug tonight\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nI need somebody\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd even though it's dangerous\nIt's temporarily painless\nI'm falling for a stranger, stranger\nEven though it's dangerous\nIt's temporarily painless\nI'm falling for a stranger, stranger\n[Chorus]\nNo need to justify\nLooking for a little bit of love tonight\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nNo need to justify\nAll I wanna be is your drug tonight\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too\nI need somebody\nYou need somebody too"
