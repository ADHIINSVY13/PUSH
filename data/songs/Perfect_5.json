Wanna know\nSo perfect, perfect, so perf–\n[Verse 1]\n(Used to, used to)\nUsed to ride around in the Mo', we kept that on the low\nYou was late night with the owl gettin' stacks on a roll, on a roll\nYou're so perfect, perfect\nWe was fightin', couldn't wait so we hit the side of the road\nIt's so good\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 2]\n9 AM, ridin' on the side of the M\nWhy you, why you call me up? Wanna know\nYou're so per–, had it, bird\nDamn it, I need it off dirt\nCount it up, [?] on you\n[?] so much\n[?]"
