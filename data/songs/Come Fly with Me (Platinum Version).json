  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCome fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away\nIf you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay\nCome fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away\n[Verse 2]\nCome fly with me, let's float down to Peru\nIn llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you\nCome fly with me, let's take off in the blue\n[Chorus]\nOnce I get you up there, where the air is rarefied\nWe'll just glide, starry-eyed\nOnce I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near\nYou may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together\n[Verse 3]\nWeather wise, it's such a lovely day\nJust say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay\nIt's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say\nCome fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n[Chorus]\nOnce I get you up there, where the air is rarefied\nWe'll just glide, starry-eyed\nOnce I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near\nYou may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together\n\n[Verse 3]\nWeather wise, it's such a lovely day\nYou just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay\nIt's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say\nCome fly with me, let's fly, let's fly\n[Outro]\nPack up, let's fly away"
