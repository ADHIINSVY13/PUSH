  "lyrics": "How you turn my world, you precious thing\nYou starve and near exhaust me\nEverything I've done, I've done for you\nI move the stars for no one\nYou've run so long, you've run so far\nYour eyes can be so cruel\nJust as I can be so cruel\nOh, I do believe in you\nYes I do\nLive without your sunlight\nLove without your heartbeat\nI, I can't live within you\nI can't live within you\nI, I can't live within you"
