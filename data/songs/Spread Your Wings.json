You're always dreamin'\nYou've got no real ambition, you won't get very far\nSammy boy, don't you know who you are?\nWhy can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nSo honey, spread your wings and fly away\nFly away, far away\nSpread your little wings and fly away\nFly away, far away\nPull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better\nThat's because you're a free man\n[Outro]\nCome on, honey\nFly with me\n[Guitar Solo]"
