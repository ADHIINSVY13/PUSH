  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOnce upon a time\nA girl with moonlight in her eyes\nPut her hand in mine\nAnd said she loved me so\nBut that was once upon a time\nVery long ago\n[Verse 2]\nOnce upon a hill\nWe sat beneath a willow tree\nCounting all the stars\nAnd waiting for the dawn\nBut that was once upon a time\nNow the tree is gone\n[Bridge]\nHow the breeze ruffled through her hair\nHow we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there\nWe were young and didn't have a care\nWhere did it go?\n[Verse 3]\nOnce upon a time\nThe world was sweeter than we knew\nEverything was ours\nHow happy we were then\nBut somehow once upon a time\nNever comes again\n\n[Outro]\nOnce upon a time\nNever comes again"
