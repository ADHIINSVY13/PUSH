  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm going on the circuit\nI'm doing all the clubs\nAnd I really need a song, boys\nTo stir those workers up\nAnd get their wives to sing it with me\nJust like in the pubs\nWhen I worked the good old pubs in Stepney\nOh, could you knock a line or two\nTogether for a friend?\nSentimental, tear-inducing\nWith a happy end\nAnd we need a tune to open\nOur season at Southend\nCan you help us?\n[Chorus]\nIt's hard to write a song with bitter fingers\nSo much to prove, so few to tell you why\nThose old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing\nAt the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes\nIt seems to me a change is really needed\nI'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das\n (la-de-da...)\nNo more long days \nhacking\n hunks of garbage\nBitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars\n\n[Verse 2]\nI like the warm blue flame\nThe hazy heat it brings\nIt loosens up the muscles\nAnd forces you to sing\nYou know it's just another hit and run\nFrom the tin pan alley twins\nAnd there's a chance that one day\nYou might write a standard, lads\nSo churn them out quick and fast\nAnd we'll still pat your backs\n'Cause we need what we can get\nTo launch another dozen acts\nAre you working?\n[Chorus]\nIt's hard to write a song with bitter fingers\nSo much to prove, so few to tell you why\nThose old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing\nAt the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes\nIt seems to me a change is really needed\nI'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das\n (la-de-da...)\nNo more long days \nhacking\n hunks of garbage\nBitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars\nIt's hard to write a song with bitter fingers\nSo much to prove, so few to tell you why\nThose old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing\nAt the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes\nIt seems to me a change is really needed\nI'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das\n (la-de-da...)\nNo more long days \nhacking\n hunks of garbage\nBitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars\n\n[Outro]\n(La-de-da...)\nSwinging stars, swinging stars\nIt's hard to write a song with bitter fingers\nSo much to prove, so few to tell you why\nThose old die-hards in Denmark-"
