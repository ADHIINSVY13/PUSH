You feel incomplete\nGot nothing else in your reach\n[Chorus]\nOut with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today\nEvery time I try to break out, I get weighed down\nMaybe no more hiding today\nAnd I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did\nAnd I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did\nOut with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today\nEvery time I try to break out, I get weighed down\nMaybe no more hiding today\nAnd I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did\nAnd I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy mama warned me said, \"The money gon' change your friends\nYou gon' take handshakes from fake fucks\nThat won't get near your grave when you die\"\nNo surprise, euthanize, you and I\nYou were the one that said I was the one\nBut when the time come, you were nowhere to find\nNow everybody wanna be around me\nI got the formula for the come-up\nEverybody get the fuck from 'round me\nWhere was you when I was on the ground?\nI'm raid to you roaches so when you approachin', be certain to show me respect\nThe Underground Underdog only get stronger the deeper I get\n[Chorus]\nOut with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today\nEvery time I try to break out, I get weighed down\nMaybe no more hiding today\nAnd I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did\nAnd I still feel the same now, and I still feel the same as I did\nOut with the old, in with the brand new, I still feel nauseous today\nEvery time I try to break out, I get weighed down\nMaybe no more hiding today\nAnd I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did\nAnd I still feel the same now and I still feel the same as I did"
