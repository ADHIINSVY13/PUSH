Aw!\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 2]\nRainy afternoon, I gotta blow a typhoon\nAnd I'm playing on my slide trombone\nAnymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore\nGotta get away from this stone cold floor\n[Chorus]\nCrazy (stone cold crazy, aw! You know)\nOww, hit 'em up\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 3]\nWalking down the street, shooting people that I meet\nWith my rubber tommy water gun\nHere come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me\nI gotta get me get up and run\nThey got the sirens loose, I ran right outta juice\nThey're going to put me in a cell\nIf I can't go to heaven, will they let me go to hell?\n[Chorus]\nCrazy (stone cold crazy, you know)\n[Outro]\nOw!"
