Right...)\nCheck me out, y'all\nNasty Nas in your area\nAbout to cause mass hysteria\n[Verse 1]\nBefore a blunt, I take out my fronts\nThen I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt\nYou couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer\nThat's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever\nKing poetic, too much flavor\n, \nI'm major\nAtlanta ain't Brave-r\n, \nI pull a number like a pager\n‘Cause I'ma ace when I face the bass\n40-side is the place that is givin' me grace\nNow wait, another dose and you might be dead\nAnd I'm a Nike-head\n, \nI wear chains that excite the Feds\nAnd ain't a damn thing gonna change\nI'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain\nNas, why did you do it?\nYou know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime\n[Chorus]\n(Right...) It's halftime\n(Right...) A-yo, it's halftime\n(Right...) It's halftime\n(Right...) Yeah, it's about halftime\nThis is how it feel, check it out, how it feel\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like that, you know it's like that\nI got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back\nWhen I attack, \nthere ain't a army that could strike back\nSo I react, never calmly on a hype track\nI set it off with my own rhyme\n‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time\nI \nmax like cassettes\n, \nI flex like sex\nIn your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck\nI used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive\nWhen I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5\nI drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it\nWith more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\nNasty Nas has to rise 'cause I'm wise\nThis is exercise 'til the microphone dies\nBack in '83, I was an MC sparkin'\nBut I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and\nKick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand\nAnd now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man\nI rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships\nI used to watch \"CHiPs\", now I load Glock clips\nI got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic\nVersatile, my style switches like a faggot\nBut not bisexual, I'm an intellectual\n of rap\nI'm a professional, and that's no question, yo\nThese are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?\n‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man\nAm I in place with the bass and format?\nExplore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that\nAnd next time I rhyme, I be foul\nWhenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild\nI hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme\nStay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime\n\n[Chorus]\n(Right...) It's halftime\n(Right...) Exhale, check it, it's halftime\n(Right...) It's halftime\n(Right...) It's real in the field\nWord life, check it\n[Verse 3]\nI got it goin' on, even flip a morning song\nEvery afternoon, I kick half the tune\nAnd in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit\nWord to \nMarcus Garvey\n, I hardly sparked it\n‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word\nI be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third\nBut chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay\nI bag bitches up at John Jay\n \nand hit a matinée\nPuttin' hits on 5-0\n‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44\nAnd biters can't come near\nAnd yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia\nI won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed\nThat's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed\nThis goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten\nBrooklyn and Queens\n is livin' fat and\nThe Boogie Down\n, enough props, enough \nclout\nIll Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out\n\n[Outro]\n(Right...) It's still halftime\n(Right...) To the Queensbridge crew\nTo the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime\n(Right...) '92, it's halftime\n(Right...) Yo, police, police man, \nyo, let's get ghost\nHalftime..."
