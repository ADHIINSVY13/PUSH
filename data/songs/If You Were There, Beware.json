  "lyrics": "This song is about how the media pursue loved ones of those in the public eye. Alex Turner is evidently royally pissed-off with paparazzi hounding an ex girlfriend of his.\n[Verse 1]\nIf you were there\nBeware \nthe serpent soul pinchers\nThree-hundred and fifty \"no, thank you\"s\nAnd nobody flinches\nGo on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome\nWe require your grief, \nthe thugs help the thieves\nAs they're trying to rob the words from her gob and\nTake the swords to the innocents\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if you were there\nBeware the serpent soul pinchers\nCan't you sense she was never meant\nTo fill column inches\nAin't you had enough? \nWhat you're trying to dig up\nIsn't there to be dug, \nthe thieves help the thugs\nAs they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart\nOut to the point she'll comply\n[Bridge]\nAnd why leave her on her own?\nIf I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it\nI wouldn't have said it if I would have known\nWhy leave her on her own?\nIf I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it\nI wouldn't have said it if I would have known\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nThere's a circle of witches\nAmbitiously vicious they are\nAnd our attempts to remind them of reason\nWon't get us that far\nBut I don't know what it is that they want\nI don't know what it is that they want\nBut I haven't got it to give\nAnd she hasn't got it to give"
