  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI thought I told you, he'd be home soon\nCouldn't help myself, you're too good to be true\nI fall short each time, every time he ain't here\nYou and your charm creep closer, closer and near\nLike a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all\nLike a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call\nYou're the wiser one, disguised from greed\nAnd I'm just a child who longs on her knees\n[Chorus]\nBut I found a boy who I love more\nThan I ever did you before\nSo stand beside the river I cried\nAnd lay yourself down\nLook how you want me now that I don't need you\n[Verse 2]\nSo you thought that I'd crumble to my knees\nAt the first sight of you crawling back to me\nTo whisper, \"Will you leave your man?\"\n'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me\nI won't stand by you\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I found a boy who I love more\nThan I ever did you before\nSo stand beside the river I cried\nAnd lay yourself down\nLook how you want me now that I don't need you\n\n[Bridge]\nI ain't yours for no taking\nYou must be mistaken\nI could never look into your eyes\nAnd settle for wrong and ignore the right\n[Chorus]\nWhen I found a boy who loves me more\nThan you ever did before\nSo stand beside the river you cried\nAnd lay yourself down\nLook how you want me now, but I don't need you"
