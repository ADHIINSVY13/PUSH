  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI know you've got things to do (I do, too)\nI just wanna spend all my time with you (It feels so good)\nI'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone\nWhen I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home\n[Chorus]\nAnd dream about you\nAll night long\n[Verse 2]\nI don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)\nIt's all happenin' so easily (Like, oh, my God)\nIt's so hard to digest, usually, I'm best alone\nBut every time that you text, I want to get on the next flight home\n[Chorus]\nAnd dream next to you\nAll night long\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)\nOr how you make me feel beautiful (And thеn some)\nThe sight of you is dramatic, one glimpsе and I panic inside\nI get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I dream about you\nAll night long\nAll night long\nAll night"
