  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPeering out of tiny eyes\nThe grubby hands that gripped the rail\nWiped the window clean of frost\nAs the morning air laid on the latch\n[Verse 2]\nA whistle awakened someone there\nNext door to the nursery just down the hall\nA strange new sound you never heard before\nA strange new sound that makes boys explore\n[Verse 3]\nTread neat so small those little feet\nAmid the morning his small heart beats\nSo much excitement yesterday\nThat must be rewarded, must be displayed\n[Chorus]\nLarge hands lift him through the air\nExcited eyes contain him there\nThe eyes of those he loves and knows\nBut what's this extra bed just here?\n[Verse 4]\nHis puzzled head tipped to one side\nAmazement swims in those bright green eyes\nGlancing down upon this thing\nThat make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing\n\n[Verse 5]\nIn those silent happy seconds\nThat surround the sound of this event\nA parent's smile is made in moments\nThey have made for you a friend\n[Chorus]\nAnd all you ever learned from them\nUntil you grew much older\nDid not compare with when they said\nThis is your brand new brother\nThis is your brand new brother\nThis is your brand new brother"
