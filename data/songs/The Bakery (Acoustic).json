  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wish you would have smiled in the bakery\nOr sat on a tatty settee\nAt a mutual friend's gathering\nAnd the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take\nLove, we're in stalemate\nTo never meet is surely where we're bound\nThere's one in every town\nJust there to grind you down\n[Verse 2]\nI wish I would have seen you in the post office\nWell, maybe I did and I missed it\nToo busy with the mind on clever lines\nWhy not the rounders pitch or the canteen?\nYou're slacking, love, where have you been?\nJust had to go and wait until tonight\n[Bridge]\nTo give me the invite\nDon't worry, it's alright\n[Verse 3]\nI wish I would have seen you down in the arcade\nSipping on a lemonade\nIn the paper cup and chewing on the straw\nAnd I wish I'd seen you in the bakery\nBut if I'd seen you in the bakery\nYou probably wouldn't have seen me"
