Don't go all coy\nDon't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault\nSee, I can see that look in your eyes\nThe one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)\n[Chorus]\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\n[Verse 2]\nThese days when I see you\nYou make it look like I'm see-through\nDo tell me why you waste our time\nWhen your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied\nYou know I know just how you feel\nI'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when\n[Chorus]\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\n\n[Bridge]\nTime and time again, I play the role of fool\n(Just for you)\nAnd even in the daylight when you think that\n(I don't see you)\nI try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\nThough I do know how you play\n[Chorus]\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\nYou grace me with your cold shoulder\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her\nYou shower me with words made of knives\nWhenever you look at me and wish I was her"
