  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy\nSo I better get away, better make it today\nI've cut twenty-three down since Friday\nBut I can't control it\nMy face is drawn, my instinct still emotes it\n[Chorus]\nI slashed them cold, I killed them dead\nI broke the gooks, I cracked their heads\nI'll bomb them out from under the beds\nBut now I've got the running gun blues\n[Verse 2]\nIt seems the peacefuls stopped the war\nLeft generals squashed and stifled\nBut I'll slip out again tonight\n'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle\nFor I promote oblivion\nAnd I'll plug a few civilians\n[Chorus]\nI'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead\nI'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads\nI'll slice them till they're running red\nBut now I've got the running gun blues\nI'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead\nI'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads\nI'll slice them till they're running red\nBut now I've got the running gun blues"
