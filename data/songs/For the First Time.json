  "lyrics": "[Produced by Dave Tozer & John Legend]\n[Verse 1]\nIs that music in my ear\nIt's like I heard nothing for a thousand years\nMy eyes were closed, locking in my tears\nI was so surrounded but still all alone\nA great big house but so far from home\nHow'd you breathe life in this heart of soul\n[Hook]\nIt's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe\nIt's like I can live, it's like I can love\nFor the first time, for the first time\nFor the first time, for the first time\n[Bridge]\nI'm electric, finally exposed\nYou see through me, strip off all my clothes\nIf this is falling, then let me go, oh\n[Hook]\nIt's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe\nIt's like I can live, it's like I can love\nFor the first time, for the first time\nFor the first time, for the first time\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm finally awake and I can feel my heart\nIt's beating like a drum when I'm right here where you are\nI can feel it, I can feel it, oh\nCan you feel it\n[Hook]\nIt's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe\nIt's like I can live, it's like I can love\nFor the first time, for the first time\nFor the first time, for the first time\nIt's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe\nIt's like I can live, it's like I can love\nFor the first time, for the first time\nFor the first time, for the first time"
