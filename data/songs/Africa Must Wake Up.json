The slums, diseases, AIDS\nWe need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid\nSo who are we today?\nWe are the morning after, the makeshift youth\nThe slave ship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter\nThe ancestral lineage built pyramids\nAmerica's first immigrants\nThe kings, sons and daughters from Nile waters\nThe first architect, the first philosophers\nAstronomers, the first prophets and the doctors was us (Us)\n[Bridge: Damian Marley]\nNow can we all pray? Each in his own way\nTeaching and learning, we can work it out\nWe'll have a warm bed, we'll have some warm bread\nShelter from the storm dread\n and we can work it out\nMother nature feeds all in famine and drought\nTell those selfish in ways, not to share us out\nWhat's a tree without root? Lion without tooth?\nA lie without truth?\n You hear me out!\n\n[Hook: Damian Marley]\nAfrica must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob\nFor what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come\nYesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones\nWho are we today? yeah, Lord\nAfrica must wake up the sleeping sons of Jacob\nWhat tomorrow may bring. may some more love come\nYesterday we were kings, I tell ya young bloods\nThe world is yours today\n...\n[Bridge: K'naan]\nDadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen\nOo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee\nOo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee\nOo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee\nDadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen\nOo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee\nOo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee\nOo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee\n[Guitar/Instrumental Break]\n[Break: Nas]\nWe want to thank y'all, everybody out there\nThis is Nas, Damian Marley\nDistant Relatives\nWe're all distant relatives\nNo matter where you from, where you live\nHow near, how far\nAfrica, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel\nWe're all fam, we're all distant relatives\nSo that's why we came together\nOne of the reasons why myself and Damian came together\n'Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa\nThat's right, you too\nAnd you\nThe whole world!\nWe're all family, we're just spread out all over the place\nSo to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!\n\n[Hook: Damian Marley]\nI say! Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob\nFor what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come\nYesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones\nWho are we today? yeah, now\nAfrica must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob\nFor what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come\nYesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones\nWho are we today? Who are we today?\n[Outro: Damian Marley]\nMorning to ya! Morning to ya man!\nMorning to ya love!"
