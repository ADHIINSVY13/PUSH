Want it all so quick\nFeel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch\nHow she get my new shit? Swear the city too small\nType of chick won't take her shirt off 'cause her titties too small\nI could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra\nNow I'm in it deep, seeing just how pretty you are\nAnd that kitty go hard, Lord, I'm up in that\nGot the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back\nType of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that\nAt the door with a towel on and nothin' under that\nSayin', \"Welcome\"\n\n[Interlude]\nHey, yeah\nYeah, welcome\nYeah, yeah\n[Verse 2]\nI let these words flow out like water from a spout\nLike rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd\n'Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak\nThen the flows hit the souls of all those that I reach\nIf I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on\nWill they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?\nSo much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain\nSit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane\nMan, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends\nWith the marijuana, wonder, \"Will this high ever end?\"\nSwear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed\nLet me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need\nJust to put me in the zone, so far away from home\nNobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone\nThey wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome\nI tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own\nI deal with it on my own\n[Outro]\nYeah, I deal with it on my own, nigga\nYeah, all welcome"
