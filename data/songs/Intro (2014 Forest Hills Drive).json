Cole]\n[Directed by Scott Lazer]\n[Refrain]\nDo you wanna, do you wanna be?\nDo you wanna, do you wanna be?\nDo you wanna, do you wanna be, free?\nDo you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?\nDo you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?\nDo you wanna be, happy?\nDo you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?\nI said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?\nI said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?\nI said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?\nI said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?\n[Verse]\nFree from pain, free from scars\nFree to sing, free from bars\nFree my dawgs, you're free to go\nBlock is hot, the streets is cold\nFree to love, to each his own\nFree from bills, free from pills\nYou roll it loud, the speakers blow\nLife get hard, you ease your soul\nIt cleanse ya mind, learn to fly\nThen reach the stars, you take the time\nTo look behind and say, \"Look where I came\nLook how far I done came\"\nThey say that dreams come true\nAnd when they do, that there's a beautiful thing\n\n[Refrain]\nNow do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?\nI said do you wanna, do you wanna be free?\nI said do you wanna, do you wanna be?"
