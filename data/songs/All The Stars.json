(Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars approach you\nAll the stars approach you\nAll the stars approach you\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nTell me what you gon' do to me (Do to me)\nConfrontation ain't nothin' new to me (New to me)\nYou can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue\nBut you can't bring the truth to me (Truth to me)\nFuck you and all your expectations (Expectations)\nI don't even want your congratulations (Congratulations)\nI recognize your false confidence and calculated promises\nAll in your conversation (Conversation)\nI hate people that feel entitled (Entitled)\nLook at me crazy 'cause I didn't invite you (Invite you)\nOh, you important? You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?\nMothafucka, I don't even like you (Like you)\nCorrupt a man's heart with a gift (With a gift)\nThat's how you find out who you dealin' with (Dealin' with)\nA small percentage who I'm buildin' with (Buildin' with)\nI want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'\nOn my mama, that's the realest shit\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars approach you\nAll the stars approach you\nAll the stars approach you\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\n[Verse 2: SZA]\nSkin covered in ego\nGet to talkin'\n \nlike ya involved\nLike a rebound,\n \nno control\nNo off switch in the way that you bringin' me down\nIt's a turn on, get it away from me\nKnow you mean wrong, keep away from me\nAnd it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah, yeah\nI just cry for no reason\nI just pray for no reason\nI just thank for the life, for the day\nFor the hours and another life breathin'\nHow did it all go to feel good?\nYou'd leave it all if it feel bad\nBetter live your life\nWe been runnin' out of time\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, \nSZA\n]\nLove, let's talk about love (\nLet's talk about love, is\n)\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for? (\nAnything, oh, oh, this\n)\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt; \nhaunt, haunt\n)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars approach you\nAll the stars approach you\nAll the stars approach you\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer"
