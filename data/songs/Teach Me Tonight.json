  "lyrics": "Did you say, I've got a lot to learn\nWell don't think I'm trying not to learn\nSince this is the perfect spot to learn\nTeach me tonight\nStarting with the ABC of it\nGetting right down to the XYZ of it\nHelp me solve the mystery of it\nTeach me tonight\nThe sky's a blackboard high above you\nIf a shooting star goes by\nI'll use that star to write \"I love you\"\nA thousand times across the sky\nOne thing isn't very clear, my love\nShould the teacher stand so near, my love\nGraduation's almost here, my love\nTeach me tonight\nI'll use that star to write \"I love you\"\nA thousand times across the sky\nOne thing isn't very clear, my love\nShould the teacher stand so near, my love\nGraduation's almost here, my love\nSo would you teach me tonight\nI must not fail, my love\nTeach me tonight"
