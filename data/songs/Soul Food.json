I grip the mic and then kill it—\nokay, I'm gone\nAs memories resurface from hella long in my past\nChillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask\nLittle Bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby\nTryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery\nWelfare, food stamps, and stealing from the sto'\nCome home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'\nCan't take no mo', mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A\nWhat can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play\nTo this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats\nNever stolen, I'm from Maryland\nWhere they shoot you in the dark of the night\nLike Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon\nCatch me rollin' with the realest\nLyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero\nFar from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in \nGoodfellas\nIf your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella\nLet me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa\nMurder the game and then resurrect it like \"Thriller\"\nYeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa\nWe don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love\nWord to my homies up above,\n we slingin' like drugs\nAnd overdose 'em like the dealer does (\nLogic\n)\nYeah\n\n[Break: Thalia]\nHip-hop\n[Chorus]\nI swear this music in my genes like Denim\nLyricism seep in 'em like venom\nYes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh\n[Verse 2]\nSee my vision as I've elevated and risen\nOpen your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision\nI finally made my way up out that section 8 division\nNot by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'\nBut by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings\nWhile the label only care about making a killin'\nFeel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G\nThat's the shit they never see\nBut I own supremacy, number one—I better be\nBitch, I said, \"I bet I be.\"\nTake my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me\nTell me, how is they gon' remember me?\nAs the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?\nOr will they be addressing me, talking less of me\nJust 'cause I was different\nJust 'cause I was doing what I love?\nAnd the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove\n'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it\nI just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid\nI just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it\nWorldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted\nWhile the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted\nStill that same motherfucker from that \nYS1\nOnly difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun\nSo when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed\nThat my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)\nAnd do my best to refrain\nFrom having conversations with people that ain't in my lane\nWill I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?\nGive the world everything I have to give\nThis is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age\nUnderstand that I'm a man not defined by his wage\nEven though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance\nOpen your mind and maybe you can see the billions\nOf people that separated, but all equal\nTo know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nI swear this music in my genes like Denim\nLyricism seep in 'em like venom\nYes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him\nSpit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em\nThen we gone"
