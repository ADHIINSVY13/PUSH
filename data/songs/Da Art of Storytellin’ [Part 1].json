Thumper\nI remember her number like the summer\nWhen her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber\nParty, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer\nWell, it was more like spend the night\nThree in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights\nWe chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right\nIn the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite all of the bullshit\nWe on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)\nTalkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)\nI said, \"What you wanna be?\" She said, \"Alive\"\nIt made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes\nI coulda died, time went on, I got grown\nRhyme got strong, mind got blown\nI came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone\nHer mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)\nI kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show\nThat I would one day see her standin' in the front row\nBut two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school\nWith a needle in her arm, baby two months due\nSasha Thumper\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big Boi]\nIt's like that now\nYou better go on and get the hump up out your back now\nIt's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now\nWe just shoot game in the form of story raps now\nIt's like that now, it's like that now\nIt's like that now\nYou better go on and get the hump up out your back now\nIt's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now\nWe just shoot game in the form of story raps now\nIt's like that now, it's like that now\n\n[Outro]\nGrandmama: Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!\nKeisha: Ugh, alright\nChild 1: Grandmama, what’s all that noise?\nChild 2: I’m scared\nGrandmama: Baby, don’t be scared. It's gonna be alright. It’s just the Lord doin' His work, okay?"
