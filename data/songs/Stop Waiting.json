  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn her favorite locket, hiding yellow pills\nWith white wine to chase them, lying on the hills\nWe kissed until we couldn't breathe\nThe coldest sand is on the beach\n[Verse 2]\nNow she's in \nher swimsuit with the yellow straps\nCutting it with scissors 'til there's nothing left\nAnd rubbing sunscreen on her breasts\nShe's putting on her sunglasses\n[Chorus]\nI could win, I could lose\nBut that's a look I can't refuse\nI could win, I could lose\nBut that's a look I can't refuse\nStop waiting\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nI could win, I could lose\nBut that's a look I can't refuse\nI could win, I could lose\nBut that's a look I can't refuse\nStop waiting"
