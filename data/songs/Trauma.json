You fucked up\nI don't hate, I just tough love, tough love\nYou think that you know, but you're out of control\nI'm the ticking bomb and the detonator froze\nAnd now you're exposed, exposed\nExplode, explode, explode, explode\n\n[Chorus]\nNo one's gonna save you from yourself\nAnd I hope that you feel better, better, better\nAnd no one's gonna want you if you cry for help\nAnd I'm there now, I'm there now, I'm there now (Oh)\nNo one's gonna save you from yourself\nAnd I hope that you feel better, better, better (Yeah, oh)\nAnd no one's gonna want you if you cry for help\n(Save you from yourself)\nAnd I'm there now, I'm there now, I'm there now, oh\n[Outro]\nNo, ah, ooh, oh, oh"
