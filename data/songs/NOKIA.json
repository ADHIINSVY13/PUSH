Stop teasin' me\nI could change your life so easily\nI keep beggin' you to stay, but you're leavin' me\nLeavin' me, we got sticks in the club illegally\nGot the whole 6ix side, they believe in me\nWe got members east of the DVP\nWe got members west on the 401\nWe had a lock on the game, but it's more to come\nYou gotta pop that ass 'til the morning come\nYou want shots for the girls? Then order some\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nWho's callin' my phone?\n (Who's callin' that?)\nWho's callin' my phone?\n (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone?\n (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone?\n (Who's callin' that shit?)\nWho's callin' my phone?\n (Who?
