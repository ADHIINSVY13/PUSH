Hit the lottery, ooh-wee\nBut with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet\nIt was like winnin' a used mink\nIronic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink\nI'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep\nGoin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith\nBut I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna, \nRihanna & Bebe Rexha\n]\nI'm friends with the monster\nThat's under my bed\nGet along with the voices\nInside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me\nStop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy\nYeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothin'\n[Post-Chorus: Rihanna, \nBebe Rexha]\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nWell, that's nothin'\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\n[Verse 2: Eminem, \nBebe Rexha\n]\nNow, I ain't much of a poet\nBut I know somebody once told me to seize the moment\nAnd don't squander it\n \n'cause you never know when it\nAll could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'\nSometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from\nYeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder\nYou're losin' your mind, the way it wanders\n(\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\n) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!\nI think it went wanderin' off down\nYonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen\n'Cause I need an interventionist\nTo intervene between me and this monster\nAnd save me from myself and all this conflict\n'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it\nMy OCD's conkin' me in the head,\n \nkeep knockin'\nNobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'\nI'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'\nDon't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna, \nRihanna & Bebe Rexha\n]\nI'm friends with the monster\nThat's under my bed\nGet along with the voices\nInside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me\nStop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy\nYeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothin'\n[Post-Chorus: Rihanna, \nBebe Rexha]\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nWell, that's nothin'\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nCall me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that\nI'll walk amongst you a regular civilian\nBut until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at\nMCs, blood gets spilled then\n \nI'll\nTake you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track\nGive every kid who got played that\n \npumped-up feelin'\nAnd shit to say back to the kids who played him\nI ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid\nOut of a hundred million who are goin' through a\nStruggle feels it and relates, that's great\nIt's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back\nIn the draft turn nothin' into somethin'\nStill can make that\n \nstraw into gold, chump, I will spin\nRumpelstiltskin in a haystack\nMaybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:\nI am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that\nIt's nothin', I'm still friends with the—\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna, \nEminem\n, \nRihanna & Eminem\n]\nI'm friends with the monster\nThat's under my bed\nGet along with the voices\nInside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me\nStop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy\nYeah, you think I'm crazy\nI'm friends with the monster\nThat's under my bed\n \n(\nGet along with\n)\nGet along with the voices\nInside of my head\n \n(\nYou're tryin' to\n)\nYou're tryin' to save me\nStop holdin' your breath (\nAnd you think I'm\n)\nAnd you think I'm \ncrazy\nYeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothin'\n[Post-Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem, \nBebe Rexha\n]\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nWell, that's nothin'\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo\nNew-hoo, ooh-hoo"
