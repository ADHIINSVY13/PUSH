(\nI think they should rejoice\n)\nIf I have one more drink? (\nIt's your body and your choice\n)\nOoh, you really know how (\nYour eyes are like starlight now\n)\nTo cast a spell (\nOne look at you and then I fell\n)\nI ought to say, \"No, no, no, sir\" (\nThen you really ought to go, go, go\n)\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried (\nWell, Murray, he just pulled up outside\n)\n[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson, \nJohn Legend\n & \nBoth\n]\nOh, I really can't stay\n(\nI understand, baby\n)\nBaby, \nit's cold outside\n[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson, \nJohn Legend\n, \nMurray\n]\nI simply should go (\nText me when you get home\n)\nOh, I'm supposed to say no (\nMm, I guess that's respectable\n)\nThis welcome has been (\nI've been lucky that you dropped in\n)\nSo nice and warm (\nBut you better go before it storms\n)\nMy sister will be suspicious (\nWell, gosh your lips look delicious\n)\nMy brother will be there at the door (\nOh, he loves my music, baby, I'm sure\n)\nMy gossipy neighbor is vicious (\nI'm a genie, tell me what your wish is\n)\nBut maybe just a cigarette more (\nOh, that's somethin' we should probably explore\n)\nI've got to get home (\nOh, baby, I'm well aware\n)\nSay, lend me a coat (\nOh, keep it girl, I don't care\n)\nYou've really been grand (\nI feel it when you touch my hands\n)\nBut don't you see? (\nI want you to stay, it's not up to me\n)\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow (\nWell, they can talk, but what do they know?\n)\nAt least there will be plenty implied (\nOh, let them mind their business and go-\n)\nUh, ma'am, I really can't stay\nMurray just go on\n\n[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & \nBoth\n]\nIt's cold, baby\nIt's cold, baby\nBut, ooh, I don't wanna go\nIt's \ncold outside"
