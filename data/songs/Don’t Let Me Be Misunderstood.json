  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBaby, you understand me now\nIf sometimes you see that I'm mad\nDon't you know no one alive can always be an angel?\nWhen everything goes wrong, you see some bad\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\n[Verse 2]\nYou know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree\nWith a joy that's hard to hide\nAnd then sometimes again, it seems that all I have is worry\nAnd then you're bound to see my other side\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\n[Bridge]\nIf I seem edgy, I want you to know\nI never meant to take it out on you\nLife has its problems and I get more than my share\nBut that's one thing I never mean to do 'cause I love you\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, baby, I'm just human\nDon't you know I have faults like anyone?\nSometimes I find myself alone regretting some little foolish thing\nYeah, some simple thing that I've done\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\n[Outro]\nI try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood\nI try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood"
