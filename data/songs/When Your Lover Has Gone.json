  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming\nThat comes with each new love affair?\nThe love that you cherish so often may perish\nAnd leave you with castles in air\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?\nWhen you're alone, the magic moonlight dies\nAt break of dawn, there is no sunrise\nWhen your lover has gone\n[Verse 3]\nWhat lonely hours, the evening shadows bring\nWhat lonely hours, with memories lingering\nLike faded flowers, life can't mean anything\nWhen your lover has gone"
