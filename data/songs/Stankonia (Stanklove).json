  "lyrics": "This wacky love ballad closes out Stankonia and features assorted members of the Dungeon Family, before finally fading into nothing but Stankonia.\n[Intro: Big Rube, \nJoi\n]\nWhat does love look like?\nLove looks like... you\nWhat does love feel like?\nLove feels like... this\nWhat does love smell like?\nLove smells like... us\n[Verse 1: André 3000 & Big Gipp]\nYou... make me understand\nWhat it means to be in L-O-V-E... once again\nWhy... must we fly so low?\nAre we 'fraid of heights? Do kites get lost... in the tow?\n[Chorus: André 3000]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n[Verse 2: Sleepy Brown]\nLet me show your mind a new freaky side of love\nOpen up your flower, please let me taste your love\nHoneysuckle sweet, can't stop\n'Til I get every drip drop–on my tongue\nHitting every spot of you, what you gonna do?\nYour body's the rhythm of the boom in the room\nUp and down, it seems to go\nOh my god, I think I'm 'bout... to explode-ode-ode\n\n[Chorus: André 3000]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n[Verse 3: Big Rube]\nMy mental fingertips scan flesh so supple\nNo longer a couple\nLike two in one skin\nWhere do you end?\nAnd where do I begin?\nBoth brains become one mind, sensually\nEvery nerve becoming its own individual entity\nWith its own lusts, its own needs to serve\nLonging for the love of all the other nerves\nAs they writhe and twist in satisfaction\nIn the burning chill of pleasure, we both bathe\nEngulfing, encompassing, like a cataclysmic shockwave\nOf an impact so deep, but not one of destruction\nBut of creation, elation in the re-making\nNo faking in the relation\nNo taking in the relation\nJust giving of the persona\nMaking love after making love\n'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia\n\n[Chorus: André 3000]\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\nStank love\n[Outro: André 3000]\n(Stank love)\n(Stank love)\nHahaha, yeah...\nLet's screw\n(Stank love)\nLet's screw, screw\n(Stank love)\n[Reprise: André 3000, screwed]\nLet's screw, screw, screw\n(Stank love)\nLet's screw, let's screw\nFor all the Texas boys, and girls...\n(Stank love)\nMake your way, makin' waves and curls...\n(Stank love)\nOooooh...\n(Stank love)"
