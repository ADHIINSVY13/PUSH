Mmm\nCan I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)\nCan I get it right now?\nCan I get it right now?\nLet me, let me just come and get it\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan I get it?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou tease me with your control\nBecause I long to live under your spell\nAnd without your love, I'm hollow\nI won't make it, I won't make it on my own\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI have promised I will love you 'til the end of time (End of time)\nThrough it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine (So divine)\nI will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme (Mmm)\nAll I want is for you to be mine, mine\n[Chorus]\nSo can I get it right now? Mmm\nCan I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)\nCan I get it right now?\nCan I get it right now?\nLet me, let me just come and get it\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan I get it?\n[Bridge]\nWhen will you run with me?\nLike I know you wanna\n(Like you want to, like you want)\nYou're the one for me\nAnd I'm countin' on you (On you)\nTo put the pieces of me back together\n\n[Chorus]\nSo can I get it right now? Mmm\nCan I get it right now? (Mmm)\nCan I get it right now?\nCan I get it right now?\nLet me, let me just come and get it"
