  "artist": "Elton John",
  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's a calm surrender to the rush of day\nWhen the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away\nAn enchanted moment, and it sees me through\nIt's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you\n[Chorus]\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nIt is where we are\nIt's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer\nThat we got this far\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nHow it's laid to rest?\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds\nBelieve the very best\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a time for everyone, if they only learn\nThat the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn\nThere's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors\nWhen the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours\n[Chorus]\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nIt is where we are\nIt's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer\nThat we got this far\nAnd can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)\nHow it's laid to rest?\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds\nBelieve the very best\n\n[Outro]\nIt's enough to make kings and vagabonds\nBelieve the very best"
