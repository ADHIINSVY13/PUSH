(Woah-oh-oh) Hey\nReally I have no idea (All)\nAll I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)\nI go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (\nMy only question is\n)\nWhere am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey\nReally I have no idea (All I know is, all)\nAll I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (\nYeah, oh\n)\nI go higher than I've ever fuckin' been\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nGot no time for no haters in this bitch\nOr toleration for this shit\nBut like medication, my dedication\nAnd the time it takes to do this shit\nReminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get\nWhat I mean is maybe I have more patience (patients) than I'm able to admit\nYeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch\nFame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch\nThat it would make me a raving lunatic\nBut I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt\nNow I get paper like a stapler in this bitch\nBut just 'cause I made a little bit of change\nDon't mean I've changed a little bit\nBrain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit\nAnd I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two\nI'll spit this crazy, even Dre, he knows (nose) I'ma blow\nBetter get the handkerchief again, haha\n[Chorus: Sly Pyper & \nEminem\n]\nWhere am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey\nReally I have no idea (All)\nAll I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)\nI go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (\nKnow I talk about this shit a lot\n, \nmy only question is\n)\nWhere am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey\nReally I have no idea (All I know is, all)\nAll I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)\nI go higher than I've ever fuckin' been\n\n[Bridge: Sly Pyper & \nEminem\n]\nOh, now what am I gonna do?\nCan't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose\nBorn a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose\nI can do it even when I'm tryin' to\nWhen my record flops, it still go through the roof\nThis atmosphere's for a chosen few\nWho was on they grind makin' money moves\nAnd you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down\nYou gotta take shots with a hundred proof\n (\nCheck it out\n)\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nBeen in survival mode\nSince a five year old, it was I alone\nSince my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone\nBut lookin' back how bad it was then\nIf it hadn't been for the pad and the pen\nAddict mom and deadbeat dad\nI wouldn't have had the savage within\nHavin' to win every single battle I'm in\nAll I ever wanted was to be an emcee\nTediously I wrote obediently, believing in me\nEPMD must've had teachin' degrees\nLearned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes\nWould be as Eazy as E\nAnd graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)\n'Til my last breath leaves my lungs\nI'ma beat my drum (Yeah) for the streets I'm from (Yeah)\nThe East side slums (Yeah), gotta remind 'em (Yeah)\nI'll take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum\nYou see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)\nYou see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, I'm (What?)\nHere for the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)\nWith this beat I brung for the beef I've come (Woo)\nBut you better bring it if you wanna reply from\n'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up\nThat'll be an uphill battle\nBut I'm up like your feet in a recliner\nAnd I think I'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber\nTime to push my ceiling higher 'cause\n\n[Chorus: Sly Pyper & \nEminem\n]\nWhere am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey\nReally I have no idea (All)\nAll I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)\nI go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (\nFor the last time\n, my only question is)\nWhere am I supposed to go from here?
