  "lyrics": "Cover of the song written for the 1957 film of the same name. Bowie was inspired to record it after meeting Nina Simone (who had recorded a cover of it too).\n[Verse 1]\nLove me, love me, love me, love me, say you do\nLet me fly away with you\nFor my love is like the wind\nAnd wild is the wind\nWild is the wind\n[Verse 2]\nGive me more than one caress\nSatisfy this hungriness\nLet the wind blow through your heart\nFor wild is the wind\nWild is the wind\n[Chorus]\nYou touch me\nI hear the sound of mandolins\nYou kiss me\nWith your kiss my life begins\nYou're spring to me, all things to me\nDon't you know you're life itself\n[Verse 3]\nLike the leaf clings to the tree\nOh, my darling, cling to me\nFor we're like creatures of the wind\nAnd wild is the wind\nWild is the wind\n\n[Chorus]\nYou touch me\nI hear the sound of mandolins\nYou kiss me\nWith your kiss my life begins\nYou're spring to me, all things to me\nDon't you know you're life itself\n[Verse 3]\nLike the leaf clings to the tree\nOh, my darling, cling to me\nFor we're like creatures in the wind\nAnd wild is the wind\nWild is the wind\n[Outro]\nWild is the wind\nWild is the wind\nWild is the wind"
