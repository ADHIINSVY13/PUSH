  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou wore a little cross of gold around your neck\nI saw it as you flew between my reason\nLike a raven in the night time when you left\nI wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name\nYou touched it and you wore it\nAnd you kept it in your pillow all the same\n[Chorus]\nMy high-flying bird has flown from out my arms\nI thought myself her keeper\nShe thought I meant her harm\nShe thought I was the archer\nA weather man of words\nBut I could never shoot down\nMy high-flying bird\n[Verse 2]\nThe white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red\nYou bled upon the cold stone like a young man\nIn the foreign field of death\nWouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say\nYou never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight\nInstead you moved away\n[Chorus]\nMy high-flying bird has flown from out my arms\nI thought myself her keeper\nShe thought I meant her harm\nShe thought I was the archer\nA weather man of words\nBut I could never shoot down\nMy high-flying bird has flown from out my arms\nI thought myself her keeper\nShe thought I meant her harm\nShe thought I was the archer\nA weather man of words\nBut I could never shoot down\nMy high-flying bird\n\n[Outro]\nMy high-flying, high-flying bird\nMy high-flying, high-flying bird\nMy high-flying, high-flying bird\nMy high-flying, high-flying bird"
