(\nIt's not that I don't trust you\n)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin' at me\nMaybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy (Happy)\nYou know that I'm emotional, you know me\nComin over cryin' just to get me feelin' guilty\nYou and me were meant to be and yet\nYou always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get?\nDon't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie\nThis time I'm breakin' out, you let your mouth overcrowd me\nI can't take the beefin' and the griefin'\nI get no room to sleep, I hope to see some, 'cause I'm leavin' (Leavin')\nMaybe next time you'll be a little more sure\nAnd I can give you more when you mature (Mature)\nBut, baby, until then, I gotta leave you\nIt's not that I don't need you, but, see you (See you)\nAnd I hope you understand why I'm bustin'\nNot because we rushed it (Hell, no), don't you trust me?\n[Chorus: Dido & \n2Pac\n]\nYou should stop, for a while\nYou will find me standing by (\nDon't you trust me?\n)\nOver here, at the side of your life (\nIt's not that I don't trust you\n)\nYou spend all your hours just rushin' around (\nDon't you trust me?\n)\nDo you have a little time to have a little time for me? (\nIt's not that I don't trust you\n)\n[Outro]\nDon't you trust me?\nIt's not that I don't trust you\nDon't you trust me?\nIt's not that I don't trust you"
