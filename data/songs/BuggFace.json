Big Boi!\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nWhat if everything you ever knew or known was lost?\nThe knees'll tend to freeze you when you gatherin yo' thoughts\nYou pause for the cause, try to recall and remember\nBut the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center\n'Cause ya mind ain't free\nConstricted by the muthafuckin' boundaries, an ounce of weed\nOr a pound of 'dro, couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting\nLife from – \nbro, brah, bruh, brother, bro-ham\nCadillac on Vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam\nWham, nigga, wham! \"Don't they say that in their show, Dad?\"\nFo' sho', man, you acting like a tadpole out of gonads\nYou know OutKast the truth, hit the booth, be makin' more jams\nSpreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program\n(Fuck the learning curve) We took our ramp to No Man's Land\nHello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?\nServe me up, I want some\n[Hook]\nBuggface, toe jam\n(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)\nJam to the jam, go jelly to the jam\n(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)\n\nBuggface, toe jam\n(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)\nJam to the jam, go jelly to the jam\n(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWhen I'm left alone, I get to thinkin' to myself\nThe mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left\nLike everything is alright, clearly tight to def\nI can see clearly now, analyzing every step (Step)\nClearly you can feel me, 'cause it's beating through yo' chest (Chest)\nAnd you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip, but wet\nWith no tint, not deject – clearly, I'm a vet\nAnd not no veterinarian, but clearly pit bulls are the best (are the best, are the best)\nLike the O-U-T-K-A-S-- clearly, nigga, you know the rest\nAnd if you actin like ya don't, then clearly, nigga, you tryna test\nCrystal clearly, I confess, and I suggest you clear the runway\n'Cause the ticket is a one-way (Clearly)\nBack, we won't be coming\nBugg!\n[Hook]\nBuggface, toe jam\n(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)\nJam to the jam, go jelly to the jam\n(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)\n\nBuggface, toe jam\n(Frown ya face up, 'cause we don't give a jam)\nJam to the jam, go jelly to the jam\n(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)\n[Outro]\n\"Can I dance?\" {*echoes*}\nOh shit, Bamboo! You gonna break..\nGet outta here, you 'bout to break somethin'!\n(Stop!) Y'all just playing around now.. y'all just playing around\nCome on, Cross! (What?) You can hear the music from there"
