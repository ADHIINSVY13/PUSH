  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSometimes I feel the need to move on\nSo I pack a bag and move on\nMove on\nWell, I might take a train or sail at dawn\nMight take a girl \nwhen I move on\nWhen I move on\n[Verse 2]\nSomewhere, someone is calling me\nWhen the chips are down\nI am just a travelling man\nMaybe it is just a trick of the mind\nBut somewhere there is a morning sky\nBluer than her eyes\nSomewhere there's an ocean\nInnocent and wild\n[Verse 3]\nAfrica is sleepy people\nRussia has its horsemen\nSpent some nights in old Kyoto\nSleeping on the matted ground\nCyprus is my island\nWhen the going's rough\nI would love to find you\nSomewhere in a place like that\n\n[Bridge]\nMahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo\nMahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo\n[Verse 4]\nSomewhere, someone's calling me\nWhen the chips are down\nI stumble like a blind man\nI can't forget you, can't forget you\nFeeling like a shadow\nDrifting like a leaf\nI stumble like a blind man\nI can't forget you, can't forget you\n[Outro]\nI can't forget you, can't forget you"
