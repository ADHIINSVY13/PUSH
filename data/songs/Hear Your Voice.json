  "lyrics": "So many nights thought that I was doing fine\nThought that time had chased your picture from my mind\nSo many times thought my heart was finally strong\nNow I find this heart of mine was so wrong\nI, I thought I'd finally learned to get on with my life\nThen it all comes back\nI hear your voice call\nYour voice call, your voice call\nThe way it used to do\nI feel my heart fall, my heart fall\nI try to keep you off my mind\nBut every time I do, I hear your voice\nSo many days I thought that I could love again\nBut any fool in love would know that's all pretend\nYou, you always seem to find your way back\nIn my dreams and I can't break free\nI hear your voice call\nYour voice call, your voice call\nThe way it used to do\nI feel my heart fall, my heart fall\nI try to keep you off my mind\nBut every time I do, I hear your voice\nYou know I tried so many times\nJust to forget you\nI've tried to walk away from you\nOh girl, it's just no use\nI hear your voice call\nYour voice call, your voice call\nCalling me, calling me the way\nI feel my heart fall, oh, my heart fall\nI try to keep you off my mind\nBut every time I do, I hear your voice\nI hear your voice, I hear your voice"
