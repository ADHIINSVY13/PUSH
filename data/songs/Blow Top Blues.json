  "lyrics": "I've got bad news, baby\nAnd you're the first to know\nI've got bad news, baby\nAnd you're the first to know\nI discovered this morning that my top is about to blow\nI've been rocking on my feet\nAnd been talking all out of my head\nI've been rocking on my feet\nAnd been talking all out of my head\nWhen I get through talking, don't remember a thing I've said\nI used to be a sharpie\nAlways dressed in the latest styles\nBut now I'm walking down Broadway\nWearing nothing but a smile\nI see all kinds of little men\nAlthough they're never there\nI tried to push a subway train\nPoured whiskey in my hair\nI'm a gal you can't excuse, I've got those blowtop blues\nLast night I was five feet tall, today I'm eight feet ten\nAnd every time I fall downstairs, I float right up again\nWhen somebody turned the lights on me it like to drove me blind\nAnd I woke up in Bellevue but I've left my mind behind\nI'm a gal who blew a fuse, I've got those blowtop blues"
