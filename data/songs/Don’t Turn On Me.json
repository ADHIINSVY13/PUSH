No, no, no, don't, don't, don't\n)\nI'm warning you, don't turn on me (\nNo, no, no, don't, don't, don't\n)\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nAin't it funny how the niggas I came up with wasn't bumpin' me\nProduct of the slum, I guess its misery loves company\nTold em' i’m a winner , i’d be something to believe in\nThey was more concerned who was rollin' up the weed did\nJay & Jay didn't work, neither did Columbia\nGot shot, got dropped, one hell of a summer huh?\nOne year recovery feel like a bag of broken bones\nBill collectors come around thats when you know you're on your own\nStrap the vest, cock the chrome\n, \nthey countin' me out, I'mma show em\nI fought my way out of mother fuckin' corners before\nI'm better under pressure I'm built for it\nBeen the under dog all my life, I'm still here boy\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nWhen they say my time is up\nAnd I am just collecting dust\nDon't turn on me, don't turn on me\nAnd when they claim that I'm washed up\nOr when my guns begin to rust\nI'm warning you, don't turn on me\n\n[Interlude: Skylar Grey & \n50 Cent\n]\nDon't turn on me, don't turn on me (\nNo, no, no, don't, don't, don't. No, no, no, don't, don't, don't\n)\nI'm warning you, don't turn on me (\nNo, no, no, don't, don't, don't\n)\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nEm and Dre gave me a shot and I ran with it\nHomie in the cell saying \"damn, my man did it\"\nGet Rich Or Die Trying made it to the top\nI'm fightin' off my competition trying not to drop\nIt seems like no one seen him fuckin' with the kid\nAll they see was me tryna take off their fuckin' head\nThey don't see the slap, all they hear is the shot\nAs soon as somebody hit, I'm sure they'll run to the cops\nHow am I the bully of the East if I don't start no beef?\nI meet aggression with aggression, I learned that on the streets\nI see em frontin' on they blogs, sayin' I'm done\nLike I ain't got that flow they know be number one\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nWhen they say my time is up\nAnd I am just collecting dust\nDon't turn on me, don't turn on me\nAnd when they claim that I'm washed up\nOr when my guns begin to rust\nI'm warning you, don't turn on me\n\n[Interlude: Skylar Grey & \n50 Cent\n]\nDon't turn on me, don't turn on me (\nNo, no, no, don't, don't, don't. No, no, no, don't, don't, don't\n)\nI'm warning you, don't turn on me (\nNo, no, no, don't, don't, don't\n)"
