  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThe torch I carry is handsome\nIt's worth its heartache in ransom\nAnd when the twilight steals\nI know how the lady in the harbor feels\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I want rain, I get sunny weather\nI'm just as blue as the sky\nSince love is gone, can't pull myself together\n[Refrain]\nGuess I'll hang my tears out to dry\n[Verse 2]\nFriends ask me out, I tell them I'm busy\nI must get a new alibi\nI stay at home and ask myself, \"Who is he?\"\n[Refrain]\nGuess I'll hang my tears out to dry\n[Verse 3]\nDry, little tear drops, my little tear drops\nHanging on a string of dreams\nFly, little mem'ries, my little mem'ries\nRemind her of our crazy schemes\n\n[Verse 4]\nSomebody said \"Just forget about her\"\nSo I gave that treatment a try\nStrangely enough, I got along without her\nThen one day she passed me right by\nOh well\n[Refrain]\nI guess I'll hang my tears out to dry"
