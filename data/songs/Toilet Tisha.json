  "lyrics": "In somewhat of a modern day version of “Brenda’s Got A Baby” OutKast tells a tale of a 14 year old girl struggling with the prospects of teen pregnancy. From Stankonia.\n[Verse 1: André 3000]\nHave you heard the news today?\nThey say a little 14-year old little girl had a baby on the way\nToo much for her little mind to bear\nAnd that type of news, to her mama, she cannot spare\n[Hook: André 3000]\nToilet Tisha, damn we miss you\nToilet Tisha is the issue\nDamn, we miss you, Toilet Tisha\nDamn, we miss you\n[Interlude]\nTisha? Tisha! Tisha, girl what you doing?\nOh my god, oh, Tisha, Tisha!\nAh, no! Tisha! Tisha!\nAh, no! Not my baby!\nAh, no! I love you, no!\nAh, good Lord, ah!\n[Bridge: André 3000]\nDon't go away\nDon't you dare go away from me, girl—I can help you\nDon't go away, dont you dare leave\nDon't go away, it ain't a thang\nDon't go away\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nFive thousand, one hundred, ten days is a short period of time\nA mere fourteen years on this precious mother Earth\nYou see Tisha had issues –\nAnd her decision making skills were still in its early stages\nYou know what I'm talking about\nTherefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which\nShe thought to be an obstacle, in her path to adulthood\n – \npause\nJust like a brother with a thousand pauses\n\"Should I...? Shouldn't I...?\"\n\"I can't... I have to...\"\n\"Mama will never see me the same...\"\n\"Daddy and Big Mama, I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me\"\nAre just a few thoughts racing through her cranium\nAs she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house\nThe unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue\nAnd no way of expressing her feelings to her mama or anybody else in her life\nTisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose\nFatality\nFatality\nFatality\nFatality"
