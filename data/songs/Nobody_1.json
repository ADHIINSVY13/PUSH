What it feel like to go miss it?\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nIn one city, one country, one state\nSome place to be nobody\nSome place to be\nSome place you wouldn't know probably\nSome place to be nobody\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nMy dawg bought a plane, said \"Let's go to Paris\"\nThat's where baguettes are from, French bread that's long and narrow\nI like the other definition, rectangular carats\nThe concept of this song is rather esoteric\nThis girl said in Grenada we should go get married\nBroke the meanin' down of the Virgin Mary\nAnd you got your own place\nMy favorite part of the night when you text me that you made it home safe (\nI'm home\n)\nI'm contemplatin' at the home base\nHow I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto, sippin' OJ\nThat's a picture right there, a moment in time\nBefore anybody wanted a photo of mine\nBefore the internet energy and social decline\nDestroyed the vibe, foolin' us with the headlines\n(Keepin' us blind) Vultures eat you alive\n(Take heed to the signs) Wishin' I'd find\n[Chorus: Nas]\nOne city, one country, one state\nSome place to be nobody\nSome place to be\nSome place you wouldn't know probably\nSome place to be nobody (Life)\n\n[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]\nAll my time has been focused on my freedom now\nWhy would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?\nThey put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now\nThat's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now\nThey tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me\nI spent too many years livin' too uncomfortably\nMaking room for people who didn't like the labor\nBut wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior\nNow let me give it to you balanced and with clarity\nI don't need to turn myself into a parody\nI don't, I don't do the shit you do for popularity\nThey clearly didn't understand when I said, \"I Get Out\" apparently\nMy awareness like Keanu in \nThe Matrix\nI'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness\nNow it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness\nThey want the same shh, but they don't take risks\nNow the world will get to see its own reflection\nAnd the anointed can pursue their own direction\nAnd if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction\nWalk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection\nSee me in my freedom takin' all my land back\nThey said a lot against me thinkin' I'd just stand back\nI got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back\nA lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that\nI turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow\nThere's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow\nWhen you keep what you know is meant for someone else\nThe ditch you dig for them, you might just end up in yourself\nI'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space\nThey keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face\nIf I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message\nSo aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with\nPride and ego over love and truth is fuckin' reckless\nY'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nSome place to be, yeah\nAin't duckin' nothin'\nJust might have to build my own city\nWhere y'all need a real nigga passport to enter\nMs. Hill, we ain't goin' nowhere\nThey gon' have to deal with us\nMake 'em uncomfortable, hahaha, yeah"
