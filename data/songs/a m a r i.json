Hungry for more\nIf you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumbling\nMulti' and I'm still munching\nBig bag, never fear fumbling\nWant smoke? Nigga don't choke\nI'm a whole fuckin' nicotine company\nDreamville the Army, not a Navy\nHow could you ever try to play me?\nKill 'em on a song, walk up out the booth\nDo the Westbrook rock-a-baby\nI never fall out with the bro\nHate when your family turn into foe\nWe had a penthouse on the road\nInterior decorated with the hoes\nJust like a multiple-choice getting chose\nMy niggas like, \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\"\nScoop up a dime-piece like we homeless\nThen we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed\nOut of the concrete was a rose, them winters was cold\nHad to go over and stand by the stove\nWe from the Southeast, niggas know\nThis where the opps creep real slow\nWon't vote but they mob deep with the poles\nI punch the time sheet, not no more\n'Cause now my assigned seat is the throne\n\n[Chorus]\nPlottin' my escape, this game rotten, niggas fake\nGot a couple M's hidin' in the safe\nImagination turned a Honda into Wraith\nI was doin' eighty on the interstate\nTryna make it back before my class started\nCountry nigga never seen a passport\n'Til I popped off and got a bag for it\nNow I'm at the Garden sittin' half court\nWatchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard\n'Ville nigga never seen nothing\n'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping\nGood dope leave a fiend krumping\nMade it out, it gotta mean something\nMade it out, it gotta mean something\nMade it out, it gotta mean something\n[Outro]\nBada-ba, bada-ba, bada-ba, ah-ah"
