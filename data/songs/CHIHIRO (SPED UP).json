(Mm-mm, mm-mm)\nSaid you won't forget my name\nNot today, not tomorrow\nKinda strange, feelin' sorrow\nI got change (Yup), you could borrow (Borrow, borrow, borrow)\nWhen I come back around, will I know what to say?\nNot today, maybe tomorrow\n[Chorus]\n(Oh, oh) Open up the door, can you open up the door?\nI know you said before you can't cope with any more\nYou told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store\nI hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?\n[Refrain]\nDid you take\nMy love away\nFrom me? Me\nMe\n[Verse 2]\nSaw your seat at the counter when I looked away\nSaw you turn around, but it wasn't your face\nSaid, \"I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break\" (Wasn't your face)\nHow come when I returned, you were gone away?\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't, I don't know why I called\nI don't know you at all\nI don't know you\nNot at all\nI don't, I don't know why I called\nI don't know you at all\nI don't know (Ooh) you\n[Refrain]\nDid you take\nMy love away\nFrom me? Me\n[Interlude]\nAnd that's when you found me\n[Verse 3]\nI was waitin' in the garden\nContemplatin', beg your pardon\nBut there's a part of me that recognizes you\nDo you feel it too?\nWhen you told me it was serious\nWere you serious? Mm\nThey told me they were only curious\nNow it's serious, mm\n\n[Chorus]\nOpen up the door, can you open up the door?\nI know you said before you can't cope with any more\nYou told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store\nI hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door? (Ah, ah-huh, hmm, uh)\n[Post-Chorus]\nWringing my hands in my lap\nAnd they tell me it's all been a trap\nAnd you don't know if you'll make it back\nI said, \"No, don't say that\"\n[Outro]\n(Wringing my hands in my lap)\n(And you tell me it's all been a trap)\n(And you don't know if you'll make it back)\n(But I said, \"No, don't say that\")\n(Wringing my hands in my lap)\n(Tell me it's all been a trap)\n(Don't know if you'll make it back)\n(Don't say that)\nHm-hm"
