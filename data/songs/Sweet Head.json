  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI tried to break away from you\nFrom the spics and blacks and the gum you chew\nWhere the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs\nBy the faggy parks and the burnt out vans\nI've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark a\nAd I'm far too young to lie\nI've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar\nIt's going to pay me before I die\n[Chorus]\nSo bob your sweet head\nBrother Ziggy going to play\nI'm just about the best you can hear\nGonna rock it in your head\nShazam! And Kapow!\nWith my guitar and me soprano\nWe can give you sweet head\n[Verse 2]\nI'm tough as glass and clean as night\nWell, if looks can love we can love all right\nI'm your rubber peacock angelic whore\nI'm a wrought iron face upon the wall\nI had ninety-nine tales of murder called life\nAnd I'm running away from it all\nI got a bedroom, every mirror in town\nThey're going to claim me if I fall\n\n[Chorus]\nSo bob your sweet head\nBrother Ziggy going to play\nI'm just about the best you can hear\nGonna rock it in your head\nShazam! And Kapow!\nWith my guitar and me soprano\nWe can give you sweet head\n[Post-Chorus]\nSweet head, gonna give you sweet head\n[Bridge]\nSee my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall\nTraumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last\nBesides I'm known to lay you, one and all\n[Verse 3]\nLook south the way your mother dwells\nIf she knew what's going down, she'd give you Hell\nI'm the kind of man she warned me of\n'Til there was rock, you only had God\nYou and I have a mutual vow\nWe both like young, and we both like loud\nI got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud\nI'm street side out with my ear to the crowd\n\n[Chorus]\nSo bob your sweet head\nBrother Ziggy going to play\nI'm just about the best you can hear\nGonna rock it in your head\nShazam! and Kapow!\nWith my guitar and me soprano\nWe can give you sweet head\n[Outro]\nMove along, sir!"
