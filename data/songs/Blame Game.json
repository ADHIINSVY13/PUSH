You to blame?\nMe to blame? For the pain\nAnd it poured every time when it rained\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nLet's play the blame game, I love you more\nLet's play the blame game for sure\n[Interlude: Kanye West]\nThings used to be, now they not\nAnything but us is who we are\nDisguising ourselves as secret lovers\nWe've become public enemies\nWe walk away like strangers in the street\nGone for eternity\nWe erased one another\nSo far from where we came\nWith so much of everything\nHow do we leave with nothing?\nLack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E\nHatred and attitude tear us entirely\nChloe Mitchell\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nLet's play the blame game, I love you more\nLet's play the blame game for sure\nLet's call out names, names, I hate you more\nLet's call out names, names, for sure\n[Bridge: Kanye West]\nI can't love you this much, I can't love you this much\nI can't love you this much, I can't love you this much\nI can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much\nI can't love you this much, I can't love you this much\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nAnd I know that you are somewhere doing your thing\nAnd when the phone called, it just ring and ring\nYou ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back\nAnd I heard the whole thing\nI heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing\n[\"The Best Birthday\": Chris Rock & \nSalma Kenas\n]\nOh my God\nBaby, you done took this shit to another motherfuckin' level\nNow, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this\nGoddamn, goddamn\nWho taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?\n(\nYeezy taught me\n)\nYou never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting\nMy, my God, where'd you learn that?\n(\nYeezy taught me\n)\nLook at you, motherfuckin' butt-ass-naked\nWith them motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on\nWho taught you how to put some motherfuckin' Jimmy Choos on?\n(\nYeezy taught me\n)\nYo, you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level\nThis is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit\nYou done went all porno on a nigga, okay?\nAnd I-I-I-I, I love it, and I thank you\nI thank you, my dick thanks you\nHow'd you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?\n(\nYeezy taught me\n)\nI was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before\nI was in there like, \"Oh shit, I never been here before\nI've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before\"\nIt's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit\nWhat the fuck happened?\nWho, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?\n(\nYeezy reupholstered my pussy\n)\nYou know what, I got to thank Yeezy\nAnd when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him\nI'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker\nI'ma shoot a bootlegger\nThat's how good I feel about this nigga\nAh\nI still can't believe you got me this watch\nThis motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted\nWith the bezel?
