Is the head dead yet?\nYou know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet\nGet the widow on the set, we need dirty laundry\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 3]\nYou don't really need to find out what's goin' on\nYou don't really want to know just how far it's gone\nJust leave well enough alone, keep your dirty laundry\n\n[Chorus]\nKick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down\nKick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around)\n[Verse 4]\nDirty little secrets, dirty little lies\nWe got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie\nLove to cut you down to size, we love dirty laundry\nWe can do the innuendo, we can dance and sing\nWhen it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing\nWe all know that crap is king, give us dirty laundry\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Outro]\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)\n(Kick 'em when they're up)"
