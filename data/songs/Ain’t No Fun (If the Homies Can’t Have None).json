You really don't know\nSo I'd advise you not to trust that ho\nSilly of me to fall in love with a bitch\nKnowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip\nNow as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)\nHow many bitches wanna fuck this nigga\nNamed Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above\nI'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes\nBut see, it ain't no fun\nIf my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it\n\n[Verse 4: Warren G]\nWoo! Hey, now you know\nInhale, exhale with my flow\nOne for the money, two for the bitches\nThree to get ready, and four to hit the switches\nIn my Chevy, '6-4 rag to be exact\nWith bitches on my side, and bitches on my back\nSo back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'\nJust get on your knees, and then start jugglin'\nThese motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth\nIt's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (Woo)\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none"
