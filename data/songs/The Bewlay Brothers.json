  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAnd so the story goes, they wore the clothes\nThey said the things to make it seem improbable\nThe whale of a lie like the hope it was\nAnd the goodmen tomorrow had their feet in the wallow\nAnd their heads of brawn were nicely shorn\nAnd how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust\nAnd the world was asleep to our latent fuss\n[Chorus 1]\nSighing, they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun\nThe \nBewlay\n Brothers\nIn our wings that bark\nFlashing teeth of brass\nStanding tall in the dark\nOh, and we were gone\nHanging out with your dwarf men\nWe were so turned on\nBy your lack of conclusions\n[Verse 2]\nI was stone and he was wax\nSo he could scream and still relax, unbelievable\nAnd we frightened the small children away\nAnd our talk was old and dust would flow\nThrough our veins and lo! It was midnight back at the kitchen door\nLike the grim face on the cathedral floor\nAnd the solid book we wrote cannot be found today\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd it was stalking time for the moonboys\nThe Bewlay Brothers\nWith our backs on the arch\nAnd the Devil may be here\nBut he can't sing about that\nOh, and we were gone\nReal cool traders\nWe were so turned on\nYou thought we were fakers\n[Verse 3]\nNow the dress is hung, the ticket pawned\nThe factor max that proved the fact is melted down\nAnd woven on the edging of my pillow\nAnd my brother lays upon the rocks\nHe could be dead, he could be not, he could be you\nHe's chameleon, comedian, Corinthian and caricature\n[Chorus 3]\nShooting up pie-in-the-sky\nThe Bewlay Brothers\nIn the feeble and the bad\nThe Bewlay Brothers\nIn the blessed and cold\nIn the crutch-hungry dark\nWas where we flayed our mark\nOh, and we were gone\nKings of oblivion\nWe were so turned on\nIn the mind-warp pavilion\n\n[Outro]\nLay me place and bake me pie\nI'm starving for me gravy\nLeave my shoes, and door unlocked\nI might just slip away, hey\nJust for the day, (hey) hey\nPlease come away, hey\nJust for the day, hey\nPlease come away, hey\nPlease come away\nJust for the day\nPlease come away\nPlease come away\nPlease come away\nPlease come away\nAway\nAway"
