  "lyrics": "Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man?\nDidn't I give you everything that a woman possibly can?\nOh, but the longer love I give you it's never enough\nAnd I'm gonna show you, baby, that a woman can be tough\nSo come on, come on, come on, come on\nAnd take it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby\nBreak it, break another little piece of my heart now, honey\nHoney, have another little piece of my heart now, baby\nYou know you've got it if it makes you feel good\n(If it makes you feel good)\nYou're out on the street looking good\nOh, you know, you deep down in your heart that it ain't right\nYou never ever hear me, you never hear me when I, when I cry at night\nOh, but each time I tell myself I just can't stand the pain\n(I can't stand)\nBut when you hold me in your arms I've seen [Incomprehensible]\nAgain and again, and again\nCome on, come on, come on, come on\nTake it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby\nBreak it, break another little bit of my heart now, honey\nHoney, have another little piece of my heart now, baby\nYou know you've got it if it makes you feel good\nYou know you've got it if it makes you feel good\n\nTake it, take another little piece of my heart now, baby\nBreak it, break another little piece of my heart now, honey\nHoney, have another little piece of my heart now, baby\nYou know you've got it if it makes you feel good"
