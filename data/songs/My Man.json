  "lyrics": "“My Man” is Bernie Leadon’s touching tribute to his old band member and friend, Gram Parsons, who died of a morphine and alcohol overdose in California’s Joshua Tree National Park the previous year.\n[Verse 1]\nTell me , how do you feel?\nLike you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels?\nDon't feel too bad, you're not all along\nWe're all trying to get along\nWith everybody else trying to go their way\nYou're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?\nJust go along until they turn out the lights\nThere's nothing we can do to fight it\n[Chorus]\nNo man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain\nAnd we who must remain go on living just the same\n[Verse 2]\nI once knew a man, very talented guy\nHe's sing for the people and people would cry\nThey knew that his song came from deep down inside\nYou could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes\nAnd so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone\nLike a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind\nCalled him home\n[Chorus][x2]\n[Outro]\nWe who must remain go on laughing just the same"
