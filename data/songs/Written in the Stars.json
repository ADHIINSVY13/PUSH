  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Elton John]\nI am here to tell you we can never meet again\nSimple, really, isn't it? A word or two, and then\nA lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when\nYou think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell\nThe someone you once loved so long ago so well\n[Verse 2: LeAnn Rimes]\nNever wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by\nYou don't have to ask me, and I need not reply\nEvery moment of my life from now until I die\nI will think or dream of you and fail to understand\nHow a perfect love can be confounded out of hand\n[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]\nIs it written in the stars\nAre we paying for some crime\nIs that all that we are good for\nJust a stretch of mortal time\nIs this God's experiment\nIn which we have no say\nIn which we're given paradise\nBut only for a day\n[Verse 3: Elton John, \nLeAnn Rimes,\n & \nboth\n]\nNothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide\nNo escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide\nYou are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied\nSometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned\nWhat it is to be in love and have that love returned\n\n[Chorus: Elton John & LeAnn Rimes]\nIs it written in the stars\nAre we paying for some crime\nIs that all that we are good for\nJust a stretch of mortal time\nIs this God's experiment\nOh, in which we have no say\nIn which we're given paradise\nBut only for a day\n[Chorus: Elton John, \nLeAnn Rimes,\n \nboth,\n & \nchoir\n]\nIs it written in the stars\nAre we paying for some crime\nIs that all that we are good for\nJust a stretch of mortal time\nIs this God's experiment\nIn which we have no say \n(In which we have no say)\nIn which we're given paradise \n(Given paradise)\nBut only \nfor a day"
