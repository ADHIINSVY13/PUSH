  "lyrics": "“The End” is an epic ballad about Logic’s rise and success compared to his idle peers. The song heavily samples “Skyfall” by Adele from the corresponding soundtrack of the aptly titled James Bond movie.\n[Chorus: Adele]\nThis is the end\nHold your breath and count to ten\nFeel the Earth move, and then\nHear my heart burst again\nFor this is the end\nI've drowned and dreamt this moment\nSo overdue, I owe them\nSwept away, I'm stolen\n[Verse]\nYeah, it's been a long time coming, and you know this all I got\nI've been sacrificing for years while the rest of y'all have not\nThese motherfuckers want my spot, catch me slipping? I think not\nSo I'ma do this shit until the day my body rot\nI said, I'ma give it my all, never slippin', I won't fall\nDown to fight right to the death, you know I been ready to brawl\nSwear to God, I seen it all, hold up, let me paint that picture\nI was poor, you was richer\n, but I'm in the ring witchu\nHold up, wait, now let me hit you with some real shit\nOpen up your mind, maybe you'll find that you can feel this\nI had nothing, came up with somethin' and I still got it\nMotivated by the shit I seen, boy, it's so hypnotic\nYeah, look to my left and see my brother selling drugs\nUh, look to my right and see my sisters fucking thugs\nAin't it funny how this life go\nOne moment you're in the dark, but when that light glow\nIt's like you're seeing for the first time, as I penetrate your mind\nLike a burst of ammunition that was shot out of a nine\nI'm givin' everything I got, so, yeah, it better be my time\nThey said I'd never make it, that's the reason I still rhyme now\n\n[Chorus: Adele]\nThis is the end\nHold your breath and count to ten\nFeel the Earth move, and then\nHear my heart burst again\nFor this is the end\nI've drowned and dreamt this moment\nSo overdue, I owe them\nSwept away, I'm stolen"
