  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOh you, you walk on past\nYour lips cut a smile on your face\n(Your scalding face)\nTo the cage, to the cage\nShe was a beauty in a cage\nIt's too, too high a price\nTo drink rotting wine from your hands\n(Your fearful hands)\n[Verse 2]\nGet me to the doctor's, I've been told\nSomeone's back in town, the chips are down\nI just cut and blackout\nI'm under Japanese influence and my honourâ€™s at stake\nThe weather's grim, ice on the cages\nMe, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette\nPanthers are steaming, stalking, screaming\n[Verse 3]\nIf you don't stay tonight\nI will take that plane tonight\nI've nothing to lose, nothing to gain\nI'll kiss you in the rain\n, kiss you in the rain\n(Kiss you in the rain) Kiss you in the rain (Kiss you in the rain)\nIn the rain (In the rain)\n\n[Bridge]\nGet me to the doctor\n[Outro]\nGet me off the streets\n(Get some protection)\nGet me on my feet\n(Get some direction)\nHot air gets me into a blackout\nOh, get me off the streets\nGet some protection\nOh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)\nWhile the streets block off\nGetting some skin exposure to the blackout\n(Get some protection)\nGet me on my feet\n(Get some direction, wo-ooh!)\nOh get me on my feet\nGet me off the streets\n(Get some protection)"
