  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow\nI've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know\nYou found me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in\nI never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden\nWhich I would sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision\nSigns of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism\nThought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen\nStudio is a system and you could say that I'm driven\nAnd now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager\nI never tried to win you over like your stepfather\nI do my own thing now and get respect after\nAnd I'm avoidin' cocaine like it was Get Carter\nFor four years, I never had a place to stay\nBut it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\nAt sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked\nAnd went from sleepin' at a subway station\nTo sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population\nNot my imagination, I don't wanna relax\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?\nI take it back now\n[Chorus]\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love, no\n\n[Verse 2]\nI take it back with the rhythm and blues\nWith my rap pack, I'll be singing the news\nTryna act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school\nI'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' a loop\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes\nI'll give you the truth through the vocal booth\nAnd stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit\nThey try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\nBut then again, that's what they're supposed to do\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\nWhisperin', \"Everything that happens is from now on\"\nI'll be ready to start again by the end of the song\nAnd still, they're claiming that I handled it wrong\nBut then, I've never had an enemy except the NME\nBut I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\nI keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic\nI'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I have it\nThis song's from the heart, cover the planet\nI'll take it back now\n[Chorus]\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love, no\nI'll take it back now\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, I don't ever wanna be perfect\n'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\nAnd I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed\nTaking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus\nPuttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\nConsiderin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless\nRhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition\n'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody can be written\nNow, absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\nVividly, need to let my liver be\nAnd I say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends\nIt's good advice from a man who took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowin' up globally\n'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally\nIt might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but\nBut I just write schemes, I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely\nYou'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates\nHavin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made\nAnd, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down\nThat's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now\n[Chorus]\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love, no\nMmm, come on and take it back, love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back, love, no, mmm"
