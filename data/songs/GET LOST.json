What will feel right for me?\nI did what's right for me\nI fought from fighting me\nWell, I would like to see\nI still get lost sometimes\nFar from a state of mind\nStay on the vibes sometime\nWhen do I cross your mind?\nWhen do you see my vibe?\nI've got a Pablo shine\nPride is another lie\nOkay, well, never mind\nOkay, then never mind\nDo I still cross your mind?\nIf not, then never mind\nIf not, then never mind"
