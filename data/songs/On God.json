Reid, that's on Clive\nThat's no Jive, that's on God\nOff the 350s He supplied\nThe IRS want they fifty plus our tithe\nMan, that's over half of the pie\nI felt dry, that's on God\nThat's why I charge the prices that I charge\nI can't be out here dancin' with the stars\nNo, I cannot let my family starve\nI go hard, that's on God\n\n[Outro]\n(\nYo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?\n)\nOkay, okay, okay, okay"
