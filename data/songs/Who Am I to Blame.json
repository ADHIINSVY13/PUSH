(Ayy) I love switchin’ lanes (Yuh)\nI love when it rains (Yuh), take away my pain (Ayy)\nDon't give up my name (Bitch) to hoes that just want fame (Yuh)\nOr anything to claim (Yuh), dig into my brain (Ayy)\nBitch, are you insane? (Bitch) Drunk and crashed the Range (Yuh)\nCombust into flames (Ayy)\nKarma is a bitch so pull out the stick and let it bang (Ayy, yuh)\nAnybody can get it (Yuh), someone, call a medic, yuh (Yuh)\nRunnin' ’round my city (Bitch) like I'm on a mission, yuh (Yuh)\nLike it's GTA (A), turn a fuckboy to a stain (Yuh)\nNobody get in my way, back in the day\nNever thought I'd be here today (Bitch)\nMTM, hit 'em with the heat\n[Chorus]\nI feel like my life is in a loop (Yuh)\nI feel like my life is in a loop (Yuh)\nI feel like my life is in a loop (Yuh)\nI feel like my life is in a loop\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me, what do you see when you look in my eyes?\nAm I sober or high? Do you know when I will die?\nI'm fantasizin' 'bout life, anticipatin’ my death\nYou never know when you might be takin’ your very last breath\nSo get out your feelings and get it off of your chest\nBuy a .357 and a bulletproof vest (Yuh)\n[Chorus]\nI feel like my life is in a loop (Yuh)\nI feel like my life is in a loop (Yuh)\nI feel like my life is in a loop (Yuh)\nIn a loop (Yuh), in a loop (Yuh)\nIn a loop (Yuh), in a loop (Yuh)\nIn a loop (Yuh), in a loop (Yuh)"
