  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWalking in the snowy street\nLet me understand\nDrifting down a silent park\nStumbling over land\n[Chorus]\nOpen up your heart to me\nShow me who you are\nAnd I would be your slave\n[Verse 2]\nDo you sleep in quietude?\nDo you walk in peace?\nDo you laugh out loud at me?\nNo one else that is free\n[Chorus]\nOpen up your heart to me\nShow me all you are\nAnd I would be your slave\n[Bridge]\nI don't sit and wait\nI don't give a damn\nI don't see the point at all\nNo footprints in the sand\n\n[Verse 3]\nI bet you laugh out loud at me\nA chance to strike me down\nGive me peace of mind at last\n[Chorus]\nShow me all you are\nOpen up your heart to me\nAnd I would be your slave\n[Bridge]\nI don't sit around and wait\nI don't give a damn\nI don't see the point at all\nNo footprints in the sand\n[Chorus]\nI would give you all my love\nNothing else is free\nOpen up your heart to me\nAnd I would be your slave"
