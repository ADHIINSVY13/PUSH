  "lyrics": "Jungkook\n22 May YEAR 22\nI thought my body was floating but it was actually the hard floor.\n I couldn't feel anything for a while. My body just felt unbearably heavy. I couldn't even open my eyelids. I couldn't swallow or breathe. My consciousness was scattering and everything was gradually getting dimmer\nBut then suddenly, my entire body started shaking as if it was shocked by something. I opened my eyes in the midst of the unknown pain and agony. \nA light faintly came into my view beyond my uncomfortable sight that felt like it was blocked by sand.\n It didn't move and just floated in the air. The figure became clear after staring at it for a long time. It was the moon\nMy head must've flipped back because the world was turned upside down. In that world, the moon was up upside down as well.\n I tried to cough for air but I couldn't move. And then a rush of cold air hit. I got scared. I tried moving my lips but no words came out. I didn't close my eyes but it started gradually getting dark. Someone spoke to me while I was slowly losing my consciousness\n\"Living is going to be more painful than death. But do you still want to live?\n\""
