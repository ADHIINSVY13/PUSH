  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBreathe the air again, it's a beautiful day\nI wish this moment would stay with the Earth\nSome primal paradise\nBut there you go again, saying everything ends\nSaying you can't depend on anything, or anyone\n[Chorus]\nIf the end of the world was near\nWhere would you choose to be?\nIf there was five more minutes of air\nWould you panic and hide\nOr run for your life\nOr stand here and spend it with me\nIf we had five more minutes\nWould I, could I, make you happy?\n[Verse 2]\nAnd we would live again\nIn the simplest of ways\nLiving day after day\nLike some primal animals\nWe would love again\nUnder glorious suns\nWith the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm\n\n[Chorus]\nIf the end of the world was near\nWhere would you choose to be?\nIf there was five more minutes of air\nWould you panic and hide?\nOr run for your life?\nOr stand here and spend it with me?\nIf we had five more minutes\nWould I, could I, make you happy?\n[Bridge]\nSo it finally came to pass\nI saw the end of the world\nSaw the madness unfold like\nSome primal burial\nAnd I looked back upon\nArmageddon\nAnd the moment of truth\nBetween you and me\n[Outro]\nIf we had five more minutes of air to breathe\nAnd we cried all through it\nBut you spent them with me\nOn our last few drags of air we agreed\nI was and you were happy"
