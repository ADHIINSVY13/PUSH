But that's just what she does\nAnd it's all night baby, and it's alright baby\n[Chorus]\nShe's outrageous, scandalous\nThe way she rocks is too much\nAnd she's fire and rain, she blows your brains\nThe way she works that body\n[Verse 2]\nThere's no weakness to her sweetness\nShe's as nasty as you wanna be\nCan't deny her your desire\nShe'll love you good and set you free\nAnd it's all night baby, and it's alright baby\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's outrageous, scandalous\nThe way she rocks is too much\nAnd she's fire and rain, she blows your brains\nThe way she works that body\n[Instrumental Break]\nJust you and me baby, you're driving me crazy\nI'll spend a little more money, on you and me honey\n[Chorus Outro]\nShe's outrageous, scandalous\nThe way she rocks is too much\nAnd she's fire and rain, she blows your brains\nThe way she works that body"
