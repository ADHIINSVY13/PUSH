Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss\nWhat I'm tryna tell you now is that you're softer than soft\nAnd I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?\nYour predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up\nAnd serving out the oven not fried, slow roast\nNo coast, tuck your tail and hide\nYou scared?\n\n[Chorus]\nGive it (Yeah)\nGive it to you (To you)\nAnd I do what it takes\nTo give it to you (Bust)\n(Bust)\n[Verse 2: Killer Mike]\nI officially do it with guns on tour\nWe lock down traps, \npush caps galore\nMy wiz cook work until it scale like fish\nMy old earth even known to handle biz\nI serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash\nUsually keep a G-pack on the dash\nTry to test my gangsta, I bring harm\nI'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes\nMy Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar\nMy waistline hold a four pound Beretta\nI'll shoelace your face just to learn you better\nMy ox so sharp it cut through leather\nMy rap name Killer, my street name Skunk\nI mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!\nI switch my slang, spit from my mouth\nI'm still all coast, my coast the South\n[Chorus]\nGive it (Yeah)\nGive it to you (To you)\nAnd I do what it takes\nTo give it to you (Bust)\n(Bust)"
