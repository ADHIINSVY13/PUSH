  "artist": "Billie Eilish",
  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"Oxytocin\" is a fun one, that's probably one of my favourites. We had all these songs and I was like \"only thing we're missing is... the song that's gonna be... purposefully insane live\". And we made \"Oxytocin\". Oh my god, it was the most satisfying thing in the world. We would, like, stand up and, like, jump around and see what felt... right. I was also just... going through crazy feelings at the time, too. And you can understand those if you listen to the lyrics [laughs]."
