Yeah\nLost in confusion, like an illusion\nYou know I'm used to making your day\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut that is the past now,\n \nwe didn't last now\nI guess that this is meant to be\nTell me was it worth it? We were so perfect\nBut baby I just want you to see\n[Chorus]\nThere's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me\nTogether through the storm\nThere's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me\nTogether\nThere's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me\nTogether through the storm\nThere's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me\nTogether"
