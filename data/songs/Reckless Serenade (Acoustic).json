  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTopless models doing Semaphore\nWave their flags as she walks by and get ignored\nIlluminations on a rainy day\nWhen she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade\n[Chorus]\nI've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need\nCalled up to listen to the voice of reason\nAnd got the answering machine\n[Verse 2]\nThe type of kisses where teeth collide\nWhen she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby\nThose twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes\nTheir hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by\n[Chorus]\nI've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need\nCalled up to listen to the voice of reason\nAnd got his answering machine\n[Bridge]\nI left my message but did he fuck get back to me?\nAnd now I'm stuck still wondering how it's meant to be\n\n[Outro]\nSinging a reckless serenade, reckless serenade\nReckless serenade, reckless serenade"
