  "lyrics": "The second to last installment of Music Mondays — this week he works out his self esteem issues asking his lady to change him. It’s apparently one of the most personal of the new tracks.\n[Verse 1]\nGirl I'm ready if you're ready now\nOoh, as I'm ever gonna be\nIf you're with it then I'm with it now\nTo accept all responsibility\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI go out of my way to live by the words that you say\nI don't wanna be the same, ooh-oh\n[Chorus]\nMaybe you could change me\nMaybe you could change me, woah\nMaybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes\nMake all my wrongs right, change me, change me\n[Verse 2]\nDon't fight fire with fire\nIf I'm screamin', talk quieter\nUnderstandin' and patience\nFeel the pain that I'm facing\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBe like serenity, help reposition my mind\nTake a chance, make a difference in my life\n\n[Chorus]\nMaybe you could change me\nMaybe you could change me, woah\nMaybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes\nMake all my wrongs right, change me, change me\n[Outro]\nGirl I'm ready if you're ready now\nOoh, as I'm ever gonna be\nIf you're with it then I'm with it now"
