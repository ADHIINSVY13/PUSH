  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old\nYou ask for the tab\nOr that moment again, \nhe's insisting that friends\nLook at each other like that\nWhen the words of a sister come back in whispers\nThat prove she was not\nIn fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams\nShe's a crook who was caught\n[Chorus]\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in your soul\nYou know when \nit's time to go\n[Verse 2]\nTwenty years at your job, then the son of the boss\nGets the spot that was yours\nOr trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is\nWill only break their hearts worse\n[Chorus]\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in your soul\nYou know when it's time to go\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nSometimes, givin' up is the strong thing\nSometimes, to run is the brave thing\nSometimes, walkin' out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nSometimes, givin' up is the strong thing\nSometimes, to run is the brave thing\nSometimes, walkin' out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\n[Verse 3]\nFifteen years, fifteen million tears\nBegging 'til my knees bled\nI gave it my all, he gave me nothin' at all\nThen wondered why I left\nNow he sits on his throne in his palace of bones\nPraying to his greed\nHe's got my past frozen behind glass\nBut I've got me\n[Chorus]\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in my soul\nI know when it's time to go\n[Post-Chorus]\nSometimes, givin' up is the strong thing\nSometimes, to run is the brave thing\nSometimes, walkin' out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nSometimes, givin' up is the strong thing\nSometimes, to run is the brave thing\nSometimes, walkin' out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\n\n[Outro]\nThat will find you the right thing\nAnd you know in your soul\nAnd you know in your soul\nWhen it's time to go\nAnd, well, you know, you know, you know, you know\nWhen it's time to go\nSo then you go and then you go\nYou just go"
