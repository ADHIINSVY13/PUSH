  "lyrics": "“Isn’t She Lovely?” is a song that celebrates the birth of Stevie’s daughter, Aisha Morris. Morris was his first child and is now a singer herself.\n[Verse 1]\nIsn't she lovely?\nIsn't she wonderful?\nIsn't she precious?\nLess than one minute old\nI never thought through love, we'd be\nMaking one as lovely as she\nBut isn't she lovely? Made from love\n[Verse 2]\nIsn't she pretty?\nTruly the angel's best\nBoy, I'm so happy\nWe have been heaven blessed\nI can't believe what God has done\nThrough us, He's given life to one\nBut isn't she lovely? Made from love\n[Harmonica Solo]\n[Verse 3]\nIsn't she lovely?\nLife and love are the same\nLife is Aisha\nThe meaning of her name\nLondie, it could have not been done\nWithout you who conceived the one\nThat's so very lovely, made from love\n\n[Instrumental Outro]"
