  "lyrics": "As I sit and watch the snow fallin' down\nI don't miss you at all\nI hear children playin', laughin' so loud\nI don't think of your smile\nSo if you never come to me\nYou'll stay a distant memory\nOut my window, I see lights going dark\nYour dark eyes don't haunt me\nAnd then I wonder who I am\nWithout the warm touch of your hand\nAnd then I wonder who I am\nWithout the warm touch of your hand\nAs I sit and watch the snow fallin' down\nI don't miss you at all\nI don't miss you at all\nI don't miss you at all"
