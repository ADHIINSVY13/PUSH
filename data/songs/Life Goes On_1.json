  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt hit like a train, I ran out of words\nI got nothin' to say, everything hurts\nAnd I know love leads to pain\nBut memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe waves came tumblin' down\nAs you float away, I'm reachin' for ya\n[Chorus]\nTo tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone\nI suppose I'll sink like a stone\nIf you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll\nEasy come, hard go, then life goes on\n[Verse 2]\nWould I miss the flames, the heated reserve?\nOh, I'd remember thе way that you put me first\nAnd what a heart-wrenchin' shamе\nThat you'll never know, just like tears in the rain, mmm\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA constant grey in the clouds\nWhen I hear your name, I think of love\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone\nI suppose I'll sink like a stone\nIf you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll\nEasy come, hard go, then life goes on\n[Post-Chorus]\nAh, yeah, life goes on\nAh, yeah\n[Bridge]\nI watched the sun setting down\nI am so afraid, I need you now\n[Chorus]\nTo tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone\nI suppose I'll sink like a stone\nIf you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll\nEasy come, hard go, then life goes on\nEasy come, hard go, then life goes on"
