  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's not the pale moon that excites me\nThat thrills and delights me\nOh, no\nIt's just the nearness of you\nIt isn't your sweet conversation\nThat brings this sensation\nOh, no\nIt's just the nearness of you\n[Bridge]\nWhen you're in my arms\nAnd I feel you so close to me\nAll my wildest dreams came true\n[Verse 2]\nI need no soft lights to enchant me\nIf you will only grant me the right\nTo hold you ever so tight\nAnd to feel in the night\nThe nearness of you"
