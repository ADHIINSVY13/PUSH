(Wah, woo, wah)\nHow you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheesh)\nBeep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (Vroom, vroom)\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Huh, huh)\n[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]\nWhen you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?\nWhen you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?\n3:30 in the mornin', scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)\nAin't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrrt)\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & \nSam Dew\n]\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me out\n(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)\nMy name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo\nIt's gon' take more than pride to stop me\nCall 9-1-1, I caught a body\nSun up now, and yesterday is fadin'\nHealing's only 'bout a mile away\nLet me tell you 'bout the woman I know (That's my baby)\nI know karma like to follow us strong (Sheesh)\nI know millionaires that feel alone (Sheesh)\nAnytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song\nMany find they life in a phone\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nYou said I'd feel better if I just worked hard without liftin' my head up\nThat left me fed up\nYou made me worry\nI wanted my best version, but you ignored me\nThen changed the story, then changed the story\nGood energy in the room, drop the location, please\nAntibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please\n(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)\nTryna keep my good conscience in rotation\nThoughts in my head, they livin' there with no—\n (Tryna keep my good)\nI made a decision, never give you my feelings\nFuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance\nSome put it on the Devil when they fall short\nI put it on my ego, lord of all lords\nSometimes I fall for her\n, dawg\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & \nDJ Dahi\n]\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me out (\nSheesh\n)\nI love when you count me out (\nSheesh\n)\nI love when you count me out (Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)\nMy name is in your mouth\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nFuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (True, true)\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nMiss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)\nMiss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)\nMiss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)\n(Miss Regret) Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nSome things I can't forget\nLord knows, I tried my best\nYou said it's not my best\nI came up out my flesh\nSomething's up, must confess (Ah, ya)\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nSpoke my truth, paid my debt (Ah, ya)\nCan't you see I'm a wreck? (Ah, ya)\nLet me loose, I digress (Ah, ya)\nThis is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)\nThis is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)\nThis is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)\nThis is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)\nAnybody fightin' through the stress? (Ah, ya)\nAnybody fightin' through the—?"
