  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCombat, I'm ready for combat\nI say I don't want that, but what if I do?\n'Cause cruelty wins in the movies\nI've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEasy they come, easy they go\nI jump from the train, I ride off alone\nI never grew up, it's getting so old\nHelp me hold on to you\n[Chorus]\nI've been the archer, I've been the prey\nWho could ever leave me, darling\nBut who could stay?\n[Verse 2]\nDark side, I search for your dark side\nBut what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?\nAnd I cut off my nose just to spite my face\nThen I hate my reflection for years and years\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wake in the night, I pace like a ghost\nThe room is on fire, invisible smoke\nAnd all of my heroes die all alone\nHelp me hold on to you\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been the archer, I've been the prey\nScreaming, who could ever leave me, darling\nBut who could stay?\n(I see right through me, I see right through me)\n[Bridge]\n'Cause they see right through me\nThey see right through me\nThey see right through\nCan you see right through me?\nThey see right through\nThey see right through me\nI see right through me\nI see right through me\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll the king's horses, all the king's men\nCouldn't put me together again\n'Cause all of my enemies started out friends\nHelp me hold on to you\n[Chorus]\nI've been the archer, I've been the prey\nWho could ever leave me, darling\nBut who could stay?\n(I see right through me, I see right through me)\nWho could stay?\nWho could stay?\nWho could stay?\nYou could stay\nYou could stay\n\n[Outro]\nCombat, I'm ready for combat"
