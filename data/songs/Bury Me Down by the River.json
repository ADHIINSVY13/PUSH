  "lyrics": "I wasn't born in the morning, no\nI must have been born in the night\nI've done my load and I'll carry my load\nAnd all I own is my knife\nI wasn't born to be lucky\n'Cause luck had no future with me\nI've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song\nAnd stand beneath the hanging tree\nBury me down by the river\nLet all the towns people see\nTheir enemy's dead, let me lay, lay my head\nJust put me down and set me free\nI wasn't born as a rich man, no\nA rich man I never, I never could be\nI've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song\nAnd stand beneath the hanging tree\nEverybody sing now\nBury me down by the river, Lord no\nLet all the towns people see, see\nTheir enemy's dead, let me lay, lay, lay my head\nJust put me down and set me free\nI want to hear everybody sing\n\nBury me down by the river\nLet all the towns, let all the towns people see\nTheir enemy's dead, let me lay, let met lay, let me lay my head along\nJust put me down and set me free"
