Don't wanna rush ya\nI can help ya if you only let me touch ya\nIf I'm wrong, love, tell me 'cause I get caught up\nIn the life I live, it's Hell see, I never thought I'd\nSee the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?\nI've been known to clown and get around, that's my word\nSee you walking and you looking good, yes indeed\nGot a body like a sex fiend, you're killing me\nWith your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony\n'Cause I hate it when you act like you don't know me\nI've been stressing in the spotlight, I want the fame\nBut the industry's a lot like a crap game\nAin't no time for commitment, I gotta go\nCan't be with you every minute, miss, another show\nAnd even though I'm known for my one night stand (Look here)\nI wanna be an honest man, but temptations go\n\n[Pre-Chorus: 2Pac & \nErick Sermon\n]\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nThrow up the finger\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nAnd all my homies go\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nGive 'em the finger\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nYou know what, baby, it's like\n[Chorus: Easy Mo Bee]\nI know you've been searching for someone\nTo make you happy and get the job done\nYou say you needed a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care?\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nWill I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows\nGetting weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go\nIn my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high\nI can hear the people calling I'm passing by\nEverybody knows I'm balling and to God\nGotta keep myself from falling, but it's hard\nAll the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?\nGetting shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool\nShould I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide\nIf you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie\nMove close and let me whisper some dirty words\nIn your ears as I kiss ya on every curve\nSlow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow\nCan't hold it any longer, so let it go\nOpen the gates to your waterfall up in Heaven\nAnd don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—\n\n[Pre-Chorus: 2Pac & \nErick Sermon\n]\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nGive 'em the finger\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nAnd all my homies go\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nGive 'em the finger\n(\nHey, eyy-ayyaahhyy\n)\nIt's just the thug in me\nYou know what, baby, it's like\n[Chorus: Easy Mo Bee]\nI know you've been searchin' for someone\nTo make you happy and get the job done\nYou say you needed a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care?\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nA lot of people think it's easy to settle down\nGot a woman that'll please me in every town\nI don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation\nGot me ready to release the fluid, sensation\nSit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand\n'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand\nEven the hardest of my homies need attention\nCatch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'\nI wanna take you to the movies and the park\nA quiet spot for you to do me in the dark\nNow that it's passion, hold me tight\nDon't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight\nI know your man ain't lovin' you right\nYou're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life\nEnough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'\nSee you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nGive 'em the finger, and all my homies go\nYo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?\nThrow your fingers up\nYou know? They gonna peep this\nThis how we run game on you\nAll my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger\nThrow your hands up, give 'em the finger"
