Prob'ly on the island\nProject call, play puff ball, the hoop was made out of a hanger\nPlayin' corners, stick the elevator, never thought project life–\nWould promise nothin' but to die trife\nFor steppin' on the next man's Nikes\nMy motto: look for tomorrow\nToday is yesterday, look at the hood now\nI'm mad that it turned out that way\nGats spray, these shorties is killers\nThe older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller\nAnd they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in\nLike \"who's you?\" when I cruise through\nI call shorty, took him in, \"Watch your friends, get ends, \nbe clever\nRealize today's the first day that begins forever\"\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything will eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know? Yo\nEverything will eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor the moment, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever (Yo)\n[Verse 2]\nNice cars, livin' like a star, club-hoppin'\nPoppin' bottles at the bar, love shoppin'\nGucci, Iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs\nOne for your wife, one for your freak, silver-spurs\nRolls Royce, too good to be true, houses worth 2.2\nPool parties, beautiful view\nYou made it in life, Forbes Magazine style, baggy jeans style\nPass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile\nAsses, pretty mommies, illest bodies, pass glasses\nLouis Roderra with Peach Schnapp,s you just relaxin'\nThinking, \"Damn, wish my niggas could afford this\"\nOn the sand at your Malibu house, holdin' a cordless\nTalkin' to lawyers, accountants, investments\nMoney doubles, triples, protect it – hard work, you manifested\nWorries of failure, when you buried is your familia\nGon' keep your name prosperin' to the maximum?\nYou should live, there's only one life, that's the physical\nRich or poor or in jail, why the fuck should you be miserable?\nThings happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'\nLove could have your heartbeat skippin', thugs turn to religion\nThe bitch you love could start to hate you\nThe shit you used to do escape you\nThings that make you laugh represent the past\nReminisce the block, gamble G's on the floor\nNiggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more\nYour favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down\nTurned 'em into shopping malls, the hood is like a ghost town\nHaunted by souls who thought that time stood still\nJust live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything must eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever, ya know?\nEverything will eventually come to an end\nSo try to savor your moments, 'cause time flies, don't it?\nThe beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever\n[Outro]\nYa know? Ya know?\nNothin' lasts forever, ya know?\nLet it go, let it go"
