Shit! Fuck!\"\nAdult with a childish-like arrogance\nWild ever since the day I came out, I was like, \"Merits?\nFuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'\"\nFrom the first album even the gals were like, \"Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!\"\nBut my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish\nAnd from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite\nSometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition (Haha)\nHogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes\nBorderline genius who's bored of his lines\nAnd that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now\nFeel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & \nRoyce Da 5'9\"\n]\nThere's darkness closing in (\nEvil twin\n), there it goes again (\nMy evil twin\n)\nIt controls my pen (\nMy evil twin\n), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin\n(\nThen I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin\n)\nBut he's just a friend (\nEvil twin\n) who pops up now and again (\nEvil twin\n)\nSo don't blame me (\nEvil twin\n), blame him, it's my evil twin\n(\nThen I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin\n)\n[Interlude]\nWelcome back to the land of the living, my friend\nYou have slept for quite some time\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nSo who's left?\n \nLady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?\nNah, F with Christina\nI ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba\nMy album's just sicker than strep with the fever\nGet the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or\nExtra Strength Tylenol 3s\nFeel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'\nBedridden\n \nand destined never to leave the\nBedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-\nLedger, my suicide note's barely legible; read the\nBottom, it's signed by the Joker\nLorena said I never can leave her\nShe'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her\nFuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?\nI'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver\nGet them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver\nGolly wolly, I vent, heat register, Jesus\nEver since 19946 Dresden\n \nit was definitely in my destiny\nWhen on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn\nI'd never make it to sophomore\nI just wanted to skip school and rap\nUsed to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes\nWhile I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em\n‘Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em\nThey were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'\nMade 'em break out the popcorn\nNow I've been hip hop in its tip-top form\nSince N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows\nLeanin' on the horn, screamin', \"Fuck the police,\" like cop porn\nFlipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn\nFuck top five, bitch, I'm top four\nAnd that includes Biggie and Pac, whore\nAnd I got an evil twin\nSo who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?\nAnd crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts\nThen again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?\nBut no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (Evil grin)\n(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?\nHi! Faggot\nLook who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there\nTwo rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair\nAnd you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs\nGuess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there\nPeace to Whitney\nJeez, just hit me\nThat I should call the Looney Police to come get me\n‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth\nI wish someone'd finally admit me\nTo a mental hospital with Britney\nOh, LMFAO, no way, \nJo-\n-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no\nHooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho\n \n(Hey, ho)\nI sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to \"Hip Hop Hooray\"\nNo,\n I’m hollerin', \nyou got bottom-end like an 8-0-8\nAnd I (Base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so\nLet your low-end raise, yo\nTango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?\nYou tryin' to hold hands with your homie?\nWhat, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?\nChange that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me\nHo, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner\nSuperman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt\nDon't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work\nSo are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work\nBut all bullshit aside, I hit a stride\nStill Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed\nAs it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side\nAnd blamed it on him when they tried to criticize\n'\n\n[Outro]\n‘Cause we are the same\nBitch"
