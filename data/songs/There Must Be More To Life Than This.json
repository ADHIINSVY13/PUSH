  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThere must be more to life than this\nThere must be more to life than this\nHow do we cope in a world without love\nMending all those broken hearts\nAnd tending to those crying faces\n[Verse 1]\nThere must be more to life than killing\nA better way for us to survive\nWhy should it be just a case of black or white\nThere must be more to life than this\n[Verse 2]\nWhy is this world so full of hate\nPeople dying everywhere\nAnd we destroy what we create\nPeople fighting for their human rights\nBut we just go on saying c'est la vie\nSo this is life\n[Verse 3]\nThere must be more to life than living\nThere must be more than meets the eye\nWhat good is life, if in the end we all must die\nThere must be more to life than this\n\n[Verse 4]\nThere must be more to life than killing\nThere must be more to life than this\nI live in hope for a world filled with love\nThen we can all just live in peace\n[Outro]\nThere must be more to life, much more to life\nThere must be more to life, more to life than this"
