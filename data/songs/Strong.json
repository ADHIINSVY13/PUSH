Should I go?\nWho do I talk to? Nobody knows\nWho knows the answer to all of my questions?\nWhen will I get over this, over this?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: \n(Selena Gomez)\n & Justin Bieber]\n(Wishing I was better with the distance)\nIt's cause you're the only one I'm really missing\nNobody else would be forgiving\nCause of all that love that you give me\nAll of the love that you give me\nAll of the love that you give me, give me\n(Wishing I was better at this damn thing\nCause it's just been too long and I can't change)\nWishing I was better at this damn thing\nCause it's just been too long and I can't change\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nGotta be strong, strong, strong\nGotta be strong, strong, strong"
