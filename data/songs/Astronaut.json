(Ah-ah)\nAll of the sweet little words\nAnd the perfect slow burns\nI wonder if you told her I did that shit first (Ah)\n[Chorus]\nMmm, but I'm an astronaut (Ah)\nCould never keep my feet on the ground (Ah, ah)\nYeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)\nMy dreams were too big to make you proud (Ah, ah)\n[Post-Chorus]\nSo I sit here and watch you and her from outer space\nI watch every part of me be replaced\nAnd slowly, but surely\nI'll drift away\n[Bridge]\nYou couldn't handle my lunacy, my voice, my opportunity\nThe distance in my confidence, no you couldn't put up with it\nYou left me stranded in the stars and ran into anothers arms\nAnd then you'll see me on the T.V. and be proud\nUntil then, just please do not forget about\n\n[Chorus]\nYour little astronaut\nWho's tethered to the stars\nYour little astronaut\nWho still thinks the world could be ours\n[Post-Chorus]\nWho's sittin' and watchin' you and her from outer space\nI watch every part of me be replaced\nAnd slowly, but surely, I'll\nI'll be okay\n[Outro]\nMmm, mmm (Ah, ah)\nI'll be okay"
