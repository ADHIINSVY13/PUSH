Kendrick?\nDid you hear that, Kendrick?\nUm, yes, um\nMy apologies I thought my time was up\nNo, we can continue if you'd like\nSo, what did you say to the lady in the parking structure?\n[Skit: Kendrick & \nLadie\n]\nYou took my damn parking spot!\nI told her I didn't take your damn parking spot\n[Skit: Helen Mirren & \nKendrick Lamar\n]\nAnd how did that make you feel, reacting that way?\nI felt decent\nOh! How come?\nBecause I did take her parking spot\nHelen and Kendrick both begin laughing\nNo\nYou texted me at 2 o'clock in the morning, \"I feel like I'm fallin\"\nWhy do you feel that way?\nLife\n\nMusic Begins\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nOne of these lives, I'ma make things right\nWith the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite\nWith the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight\nRain on me, put the blame on me\nGot guilt, got hurt, got shame on me\nGot six magazines that's aimed at me\nDone every magazine, what's fame to me? \nFuck, Man!\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nIt's a game to me, where the bedroom at?\nSleep, I ain't never had affairs with that\nWhat's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?\nWhat's fair when the money don't take things back?\nIt's rare when somebody take your dreams back\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nI care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much\nI\n shut down too, I ain't there too much\nI'm a complex soul, they layered me up\nThen broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nThis time around, I trust myself\nPlease everybody else but myself\nAll else fails, I was myself\nOutdone fear, outdone myself\nThis year, you better one yourself\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nMasks on the babies, mask on an opp\nWear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop\nBut a mask won't hide who you are inside\nLook around, the reality's carved in lies\nWipe my ego, dodge my pride\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nLook myself in the mirror\nAmityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier\nI fought like a pitbull terrier\nBlood I shed could fill up aquariums\nTell all my angels, \"Carry 'em\"\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\nEvery emotion been deprived\nEven my strong points couldn't survive\nIf I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me out\nI love when you count me\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\n(And I'm tripping and falling)\n(And I'm-)"
