  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe's pining for her in a people carrier\nThere might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture won't do\nAlthough it might say a lot about the city or town\nI don't care what they've got, keep on turning 'em down\nIt don't say the funny things she does\nDon't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen\n[Verse 2]\nHe's got the feeling again, this time on the aeroplane\nThere might be tellies in the back of the seats in front, but Rodney and Del won't do\nAlthough it might take your mind off the aches and the pains\nLaugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same\n'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand\nShe won't be waiting for you when you land\n[Chorus]\nAnd it feels like she's just nowhere near\nYou could well be out on your ear\nThis thought comes closely followed by the fear\nAnd the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill\n[Verse 3]\nYesterday, I saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with\nAnd almost shouted\nAnd then reality kicked in within us,\n \nit seems as we become the winners\nYou lose a bit of summat, and half wonder if you want it at all\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd don't say owt\n \n'cause you've got no idea\nAnd she's still nowhere near\nAnd the thought comes closely followed by the fear\nAnd the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill\n[Outro]\nDespair in the departure lounge\nIt's one and they'll still be around at three\nNo signal and low battery\nWhat's happened to me?"
