  "lyrics": "They're pickin' up the prisoners\nAnd putting 'em in a pen\nAnd all she wants to do is dance, dance\nRebels been rebels\nSince I don't know when\nAnd all she wants to do is dance\nMolotov cocktail, the local drink\nAnd all she wants to do is dance, dance\nThey mix 'em up right\nIn the kitchen sink\nAnd all she wants to do is dance\nCrazy people walkin' round\nWith blood in their eyes\nAnd all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance\nWild-eyed pistol-wavers\nWho ain't afraid to die\nAnd all she wants to do is\nAll she wants to do is dance\nAnd make romance\nShe can't feel the heat\nComin off the street\nShe wants to party\nShe wants to get down\nAll she wants to do is\nAll she wants to do is dance\n\nWell the government bugged the men's room\nIn the local disco lounge\nAnd all she wants to do is dance, dance\nTo keep the boys from sellin'\nAll the weapons they could scrounge\nAnd all she wants to do is dance\nBut that don't keep the boys\nFrom makin' a buck or two\nAnd all she wants to do is dance, dance\nThey still can sell the army\nAll the drugs that they can do\nAnd all she wants to do is\nAll she wants to do is dance\nAnd make romance\nWell, we barely made the airport\nFor the last plane out\nAs we taxied down the runway\nI could hear the people shout\nThey said, \"Don't come back here, Yankee\"\nBut if I ever do\nI'll bring more money\n\n'Cause all she wants to do is dance\nAnd make romance\nNever mind the heat\nComin' off the street\nShe wants to party\nShe wants to get down\nAll she wants to do is\nAll she wants to do is dance\nAnd make romance\nAll she wants to do is dance"
