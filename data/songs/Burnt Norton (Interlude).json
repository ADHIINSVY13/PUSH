  "lyrics": "[Interlude]\nTime present and time past\nAre both perhaps present in time future\nAnd time future contained in time past\nIf all time is eternally present\nAll time is unredeemable\nWhat might have been is an abstraction\nRemaining a perpetual possibility\nOnly in a world of speculation\nWhat might have been and what has been\nPoint to one end, which is always present\nFootfalls echo in the memory\nDown the passage which we did not take\nTowards the door we never opened\nInto the rose-garden"
