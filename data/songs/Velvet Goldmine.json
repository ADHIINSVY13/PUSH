  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou got crazy legs, you got amazing head\nYou got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red\nYou got the width of my tongue, name on the sun\nI clutch you close to my breast 'cause you're the only one\nWho uses school to pleasure\n[Verse 2]\nYou make me act real gone, you make me troll along\nI had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry\nFeel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own\nWhy if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?\nHere all together\n[Chorus]\nVelvet goldmine\n, you stroke me like the rain\nSnake it, take it, panther princess you must stay\nVelvet goldmine, naked on your chain\nI'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again\nMy velvet goldmine\n[Verse 3]\nYou're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip\nI'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet\nSo you'll give me your hand, give me your sound\nLet me sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand\nOoh, clutch your makeup\n\n[Chorus]\nVelvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain\nSnake it, take it, panther princess you must stay\nVelvet goldmine, naked on your chain\nI'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again\nMy velvet goldmine\n[Bridge]\nOh\nShoot you down, bang, bang\n[Chorus]\nVelvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain\nSnake it, take it, panther princess you must stay\nVelvet goldmine, naked on your chain\nI'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again\nMy velvet goldmine\n[Outro]\n(hum) Velvet Goldmine (repeat)"
