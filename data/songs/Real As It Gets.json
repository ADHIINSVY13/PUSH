(Hands up!)\n[Verse 1: Jeezy]\nAllow me to re-introduce myself\nAt the same time re-introduce my wealth\nAt the same time rejuvenate the game\nIt's for my old dawg niggas that's used to 'caine\nNow what my B-dog said? I respect the game\nGD's\n, \nVice Lords\n, \nthe Crips\n \nthe same\nAnd I know y'all 'bout to say this off the chain\nTell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane\nSee I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain\nAnd when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain\nAnd if you just tunin' in, let me explain\nYou know I keep that 47, Uday Hussein\nThese niggas way too far, I played the game\nAnd if you listen hard enough, I say some things\nAnd when that sack got low, I shave them things\nAnd put 'em right back together, I made them things\n[Chorus: Jeezy & \nJay-Z\n]\nNow put your sets in the air if you represent your clique\nMoney in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby\nPut your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch\nSay you looking for the real?

Wassup, wassup\nWhere the West Coast at? Put your W's up\nWhere my East Coast niggas that hustle to live\nAnd all my niggas up north that's doin' a bid?\nOh yeah I'm rare, I'm aware that I'm rare\nI rap and I’m real, I'm one of the few here\nThese other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care\nThey stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear\nBut don't really matter as long as they stay clear\nClear of the real shit we doin' over here\nWhen my nigga get home, I'm gon' send him a Lear\nFor all the time he been down, get him right up in the air\nWith a couple of broads, get him right up in the air\nMile high club, get him right up in there\nSend my nigga some gear like he never missed a year\nBy the time you hear this song, he'll be standin' right here\nReal nigga shit there\n[Chorus: Jeezy]\nNow put your sets in the air if you represent your clique\nMoney in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby\nPut your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch\nSay you lookin' for the real?
