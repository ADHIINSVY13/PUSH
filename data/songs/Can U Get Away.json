Can you get away?\nLet me come swoop you up\n(You know I got a man)\nI know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out\n(Of course he gon' mind)\nLet me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see\n(I can't, he ain't gon' let me)\nAww c'mon! Pleeeeeease...\n(Nah)\nOh aight – what's wrong with your eye?\nWhy you got on glasses?\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nEver since I met ya I could peep the pressure\nIt's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya\nI can see your state of misery from the introduction\nAin't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nLate night phone conversations – would that be OK?\nI don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line\nTell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind\nI can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you\nThe anticipation of love makin'\nGot you shakin' when I'm standin' near you\nNews of precision will prepare ya\nIn case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror\nNow the picture's gettin' clearer\nAll he does is hit you hard\nI tell you to leave him, \nand you tell me keep my faith in God\nI don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home\nI wonder should I leave you alone\nAnd find a woman of my own\nAll the homies tell me that you don't deserve it\nI contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\n\nEbony, can you get away?\nC'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?\nCan you get away?\n[Hook: Anya Pinto & (2Pac)]\nSo much pressure in the air (I know, I know)\nAnd I can't get away (Just for a little while love)\nI'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)\nSo much pressure in the air\n(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)\nAnd I can't get away (Do you love him?)\nI'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nCould it be my destiny to be lonely?\nAin't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me\n‘Cause they phony\nBut you was different\n, I got no need to be suspicious\n‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious\nThe way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted\nI'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it\nEven though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it\nSlowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it\nYou blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'\nNow your heart's tooken\nMy only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook\nWanna take you there but you scared to follow\nCome see tomorrow\nHopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow\nLet you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle\nDepend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble\nI wanna give you happiness and maybe even more\nI told you before, no time to waste\nWe can hook up at the store. Can you get away?\n\n[Hook: Anya Pinto & (2Pac)]\nSo much pressure in the air (I know it is)\nAnd I can't get away (Yeah, you can)\nI'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)\nSo much pressure in the air (I know… is he beatin' on you?)\nAnd I can't get away (Did he punch you?)\nI'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nI sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'\nIn the position to pressure and offer competition\nMe and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely\n‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see\nA happy home – that's my fantasy\nBut my reality is problems with your man and me\nWhat can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker\n‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta\nDon't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast\nNobody knows, on who controls will it last?\nBefore I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere\nAnd even if you stay with him today I'm still here\nI refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share\nYou're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare\n‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know\nPassionately yours and I'll never let you go\nTell me, can you get away?\n\n[Hook: Anya Pinto & (2Pac)]\nSo much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)\nAnd I can't get away\nI'm not happy here\n(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)\nSo much pressure in the air (Man)\nAnd I can't get away (Course you can get away)\nI'm not happy here\n(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nYou ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress\nWith this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?\nI ain't tryin' to put you in a position\nWhere you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything\nYou need, but now… he ain't even takin' care of you\nHe beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!\nYou too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga\nYa know what I'm sayin'?\nShake that sucker to the left\nLet me show you what this life is really about\nYa know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class\nNeed to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world\nSeein' what this world got to offer you\nNot goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?\nThe emergency room, gettin' stitches\n‘Cause this nigga done got jealous. \nDon't cry, it's all good\n[2Pac and Anya talking again]\nCan you take me from here?\nShake that man, get away\nCan you take me from here?\nI'ahhhhhm unhappy here\nAnd I need you to show me love\nBecause it's so much pressure now\nAnd I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh"
