  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYou know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me\nLooking down from Heaven, laughing\nAnd trying to see how much I can take\nBecause the way things go, it's like a joke\nNobody's had more shots at the moon and missed than me\n[Verse 1]\nIt's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind\nTrying to make something of myself\nLife's got something else in mind\nI'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time\nYou won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop\nI don't want to hear another word about your why nots\nI bought your bullshit all before\nNow you trying to sell me more, babe\n[Chorus]\nMan who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose\nSold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose\nI'm tired, tired of singing the blues\nI'm tired\n[Verse 2]\nI'm walking down the streets\nYou wouldn't know what I was thinking\nIt's just another white girl day, hey\nRibbons in my hair and I am sinking down\nA double life, a sordid past and I am drinking now\nI want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up\nI don't want to know another thing you think you know about me\nI'm not who you think I am, smiling but I ain't happy\n\n[Chorus]\nA man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose\nSold my soul long ago, nothing I can choose\nI'm tired, tired of singing the blues\nI'm tired\n[Bridge]\nOh, I'm so far gone\nI can't turn off my mind, it's like a ticking time bomb\nTrying to kill me from inside\nHaunting day and night\nIs there no remedy for memory?\n[Verse 3]\nI've felt this way before\nI've known the depths of utter desperation\nMy boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star\nWith loneliness as my occupation\nI know that he's right but I don't care tonight\nI want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop\nI keep running around the same town\nKnocking you down, I'm fucked\nHow can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?\n[Chorus]\nA man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose\nSold my soul long ago, nothing I can choose\nI'm tired, tired of singing the blues\nI'm tired"
