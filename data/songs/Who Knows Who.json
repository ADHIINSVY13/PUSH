No!)\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you want\n\nYeah I've been and gone\nWith who knows who\nDoing God knows what\nDon't tell me how\nI'll return at any hour\nFuck all your law, fuck your power\nYeah I've been and gone\nWith who knows who\nDoing God knows what\nDon't tell me how\nI'll return at any hour\nFuck all your law, fuck your power"
