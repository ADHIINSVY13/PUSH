  "lyrics": "Quiet nights of quiet stars\nQuiet chords from my guitar\nFloating on the silence that surrounds us\nQuiet thoughts and quiet dreams\nQuiet walks by quiet streams\nAnd a window looking on the mountains and the sea\nHow lovely\nThis is where I want to be\nHere with you so close to me\nUntil the final flicker of life's ember\nI, who was lost and lonely\nBelieving life was only\nA bitter tragic joke, have found with you\nThe meaning of existence, my love\nI who was lost and lonely\nBelieving life was only\nA bitter tragic joke, have found with you\nThe meaning of existence, my love"
