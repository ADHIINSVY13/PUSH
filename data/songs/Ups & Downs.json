This is Snoop Dogg\nI'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'ma do y'all\nHangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young Q-Ball\nGivin' me the word on the streets, here's the scoop, y'all\nThe niggas from Tha Eastsidaz split up (Split up)\nAnd one of 'em tried to fuck your shit up (What?)\nNah cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life\nI'm out with the bullshit, I'm in with the real shit\nI'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit\nNow that's the business, and God as my witness\nLBC\n, 213, hell yeah, we in this\nIt's so relentless and all my dogs up against the life sentence\nI love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit\nOn some Crip shit, homie, dig this\n\n[Chorus]\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\n[Verse 2]\nI used to have a lot of broads that I don't fool with\nI used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with\nA lot of people that a nigga went to school with\nHappy as hell to see the big dog doin' it\nBut wouldn't none of them believe it though (What?)\nThat I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow\nI guess he was right, these are the breaks\nDespite my mistakes and aches, I'm getting cake\nTo realize your fate through faith\n'Cause we all gon' get that day (For what?)\nTo see if our life was straight\nAnd see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)\nTo see the man upstairs\nOn some real talk, homie, I'm tired of bein' stuck here\nIf I could, I would fly to the moon (Zoom)\nY'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms, I know\n[Chorus]\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\n\n[Outro]\nNow, as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say\nI never seen him in church, but he always had the word\nHe always would tell me, \"Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad\nYou got to do bad in order to do good\""
