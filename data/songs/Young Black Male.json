It's off with some clothes\nProud when the crowd says \"ho\"\nThat let's me know they know I can flow\nI love when they come to my shows\nI get up and go with skins before\nWhen I'm collecting my dough\nI let 'em respect the way that I rep\nThe quicker the nigga can wreck\nThe bigger the check, now watch how they sweat\nNow what kind of style is that?\nThe style of a mack and ready to jack\nI ran through the piles of wack\nThe wacker the pack, the fatter the smack\nThey hate it when real niggas bust\nThey hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust\nI had enough of the fuss\nI bust what I bust and cuss when I must\nThey gave me a charge for sales\nFor selling the tales of young Black males\n\n[Outro]\nYes, nigga\nN-I-G-G-A, niggas\nAyy, nigga, you can't handle that shit\nPass that, man\nHit that shit, that's the shit\nIt smell like skunk\nSkunk smell like that nigga over there mama\nSome old funky-ass shit\nWe ain't nothin' but some low down dirty niggas\nKeep it real, nigga, fuck you, nigga\nYou ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker\nFuck St. Ides, it's an Olde E thing, baby\nStick with some of that Hennessy\nCan I drink with you, fellas? Can I get in on it in here?\nFuck you, Capo, you ain't in, baby\nI tell you what\nYou guys are not gonna be talking all that shit, when I come back, okay?\nWe gonna see who the big mouth when I come back\nYoung Black male— male"
