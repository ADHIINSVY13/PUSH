  "lyrics": "The prettiest thing I ever did see\nWas lightning from the top of a cloud\nMoving through the dark\nA million miles an hour with somewhere to be\nSo why does it seem like a picture\nThat's hangin' up on someone else's wall?\nLately I just haven't been myself at all\nIt's heavy on my mind\nAnd I'm dreamin' again\nLike I've always been\nWay down low\nI still know\nThat the prettiest thing I ever did see\nWas dusty as the handle on the door\nRusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor\nIt looks like home to me\nNow I'm dreamin' again\nLike I've always been\nWay down low\nThinkin' of the prettiest thing\nDreamin'\nDreamin'"
