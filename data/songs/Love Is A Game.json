  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAll your expectations of my love are impossible\nSurely, you know that I'm not easy to hold\nIt's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am\nMy heart speaks in puzzle and codes\nI've been trying my whole life to solve\nGod only knows how I've cried\nI can't take another defeat\nA next time would be the ending of me\nNow that I see\n[Chorus]\nThat love is a game for fools to play\nAnd I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\nTo self-inflict that pain\nLove is a game for fools to play\nAnd I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\nTo self-inflict that pain\n[Verse 2]\nHow unbelievable (Unbelievable)\nOf me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)\nThe dream that I sell (Dream I sell)\nWhen heartache, it's inevitable (And unbearable)\nBut I'm no good at doing it well\nNot that I care (I don't care)\nWhy should anything about it be fair?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen love is a game for fools to play\nAnd I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\nTo self-inflict that pain\nLove is a game for fools to play\nAnd I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\nTo self-inflict that pain\n[Bridge]\nNo amount of love\nCan keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)\nI can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)\nWhen I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)\nThe feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise\n[Chorus]\nLove is a game for fools to play\nAnd I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\nTo self-inflict that pain\nLove is a game for fools to play\nAnd I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\nTo self-inflict that pain\n[Outro]\nOh, you know I'd do it all again\nI love it now like I loved it then\nI'm a fool for them\nYou know I'm, you know I'm gonna do it, oh\nI'll do it all again like I did then"
