I don't know\nThen I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks\nWonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling\nWonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me\nWonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't care\nI'd rather tell the truth (Truth)\nThan make it worse for you, mm (You)\n[Chorus]\nIf the sun refused to shine\nBaby, would I still be your lover?\nWould you want me there?\nIf the moon went dark tonight\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow\nWould I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow\nWould you be the one on mine?\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlease, pay me no mind\nWhile I jump into your skin and change your eyes\nSo you see things through mine (Through mine, through mine, through mine, through mine)\nCan't you sense me? I've been right here all this time (All this time)\nWould you still be here pretending you still like me? (Would you still be?)\nPretending you don't regret not thinking before asking\nNow you're long gone in Cali (Now you're long)\nAnd me, I'm still unpacking (Still unpacking)\nWhy I even allowed you on the flight\n[Outro]\nI broke your heart because you broke mine (I broke your heart)\nSo me, I am the bad guy (I am the bad guy)\n'Cause I'd already grieved you\nAnd you started to realize\nI do need ya, I did (Mm)\nI wish I could un-need ya, so I did"
