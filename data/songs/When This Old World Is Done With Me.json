  "artist": "Elton John",
  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI won't want for nothing\nI've been alright, I've been okay, I've been fine\nI've had clouds of silver linings, complicated mornings\nLove that left me wanting and hearts that change my mind\nI can feel the cold front\nI've been chilly, I've been frozen, I've been warm\nI've felt sympathy and silence, helping hands and guidance\nHappiness and anger since the day that I was born\n[Chorus]\nWhen this old world is done with me\nJust know I came this far\nTo be broken up in pieces\nScatter me among the stars\nWhen this old world is done with me\nWhen I close my eyes\nRelease me like an ocean wave\nReturn me to the tide\n[Verse 2]\nNone of this came easy\nThe shadows, the curtain, or the light\nThe pain inside the leaving, the taming of the demons\nNo longer any reason left for me to fight\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd when this old world is done with me\nJust know I came this far\nTo be broken up in pieces\nScatter me among the stars\nWhen this old world is done with me\nWhen I close my eyes\nRelease me like an ocean wave\nReturn me to the tide\nRelease me like an ocean wave\nReturn me to the tide\n[Instrumental Outro]"
