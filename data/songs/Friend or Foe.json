State your biz\nUmmm, you tendin' dough? Ah, there it is\nMe, I run the show, oh, and these kids\nDon't like nobody comin' around here fuckin' with they dough for shit\nYou enterprisin' though, and I like it\nBut fuck with the big dogs, yo? I gotta bite ya\nLook, it's out of my hands\nAnd you gettin' money 'round here, it's not in the plans\nDon't hop yo' ass out of that van, head back to Kansas\nI'm sendin' niggas back up in campuses\nChance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is\nLet me guess – they said it was money 'round here\nAnd the rest is me stoppin' you from gettin' it, correct?\nSorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel\nI'll take care of that, you'll soon see\nNow, please give me the room key\nYou're twitchin', don't do that, you makin' me nervous\nMy crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers\nSo, please, would you put your hand back in sight?\nThey don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right?\nYou draw? Better be Picasso—you know, the best\n'Cause if this is not so? Ah, God bless\nYou leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice\nBelieve you me, son\nI hate to do it, just as bad as you hate to see it done\nNow calm your boys\n'Cause I'm findin' it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise\nGet the point? I'll let you go; before you leave\nI guess I ought to let you know, I need those keys\nAnd a promise you never, no matter the weather\nEver ever ever ever ever ever come around here no mo' – ha-haha"
