  "lyrics": "I know baby's bad for my self-esteem\nFInd another face for your sympathy\nSome of us cry, some of them lie\nBut no one sees inside\nThe spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone\nMaybe I can't survive in the danger zone\nSounds of the night\nStreets without light\nAnd baby's not alone\nTry to hold her to myself\nSomeone else is breaking all my dreams, she\nNeeds so many games to play\nOne more time I climb the stairs\nOpen up the door and she was gone\nAnd baby here I go\nLike a lamb to slaughter\nDon't stop haunting me in this old house\nI still love you when you're not around\nI'm still waiting for your midnight ride\nI'll still love you when it's cold outside\nMe so sorry that I let you down\nBut you keep haunting me in this old town\n\nSpoken:\nAnd the smile is no longer there\nThe face and the eyes and the hair\nNothing stands the test of time\nYou live forever, never mine\nI cling to dreams that turn to sand\nOur life is now a distant land\nWe commit emotional suicide\nEvery single room is electrified\nYour memory shadowing me\nThe house where sorrow hides\nPull it down, blow it up\nHelp me send these walls of love away\nAnd baby here I go\nLike a lamb to slaughter\nDon't stop haunting me in this old house\nI still love you when you're not around\nI'm still waiting for your midnight ride\nI'll still love you when it's cold outside\nMe so sorry that I let you down\nBut you keep haunting me in this old town"
