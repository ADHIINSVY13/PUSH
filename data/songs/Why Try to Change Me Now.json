  "lyrics": "I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain\nI've got some habits even I can't explain\nCould start for the corner, turn up in Spain\nBut why try to change me now?\nI sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore\nCigarette ashes, there they go on the floor\nI'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door\nBut why try to change me now?\nWhy can't I be more conventional?\nPeople talk, people stare, so I try\nBut that's not for me, 'cause I can't see\nMy kind of crazy world go passing me by\nSo, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown\nYou know I'll love you till the moon's upside down\nDon't you remember I was always your clown?\nWhy try to change me now?"
