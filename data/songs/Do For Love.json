You're killin' me with your jealousy\nNow my ambition's to be free\nI can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap\nI hear you callin' me to come back,\n I'm a sucker for love\n[Chorus: Eric Williams & \n2Pac\n]\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (\nThat's right, sucker for love\n)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (\nSucker for love\n)\nWhat you won't do, do for love?\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nJust when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy, you tried to trap me\nSaid you're pregnant and guess who the daddy?\n Don't wanna fall for it\nBut in this case what could I do? So now I'm back\nTo makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true\nWhat if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on\nTryna be strong and in the process, keep it goin'\nI'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close\nTo packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost\nTell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go\nTo clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control\nMy heart is sayin', \"Leave!\" Oh, what a tangled web we weave\nWhen we conspire to conceive, and now\nYou gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'\nThat's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door\nNever no more you will see me, this is the end\n'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love\n[Chorus: Eric Williams & \n2Pac\n]\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (\nSucker for love\n)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Don't, \nsucker for love\n)\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (Oh, yeah, \nsucker for love\n)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Oh, baby)\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nNow he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay\nAs you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away\nIt wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship\nIt used to be love, happiness and companionship\nRemember when I treated you good\nI moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood\nMe and you, a happy home, when it was on\nI had a love to call my own\nI should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes\nPreoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie\nYou had a man and I knew it, you told me\nDon't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure\nMake a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone\nI'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh\nI wanna take your misery\nReplace it with happiness but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love\n\n[Chorus: Eric Williams & \n2Pac\n]\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (What you won't do for love, \nsucker for love\n)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (\nThat ain't right, I'm a sucker for love\n)\nWhat you won't do, do for love?\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (No)\n[Outro: Eric Williams & \n2Pac\n]\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (\nSucker for love\n)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (\nSucker for love\n)\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (\nSucker for love\n)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (\nSucker for love\n)\nWhat you won't do? (Do for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\nWhat you won't do? (Do for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\nDo for love, yeah, baby, yeah\nDo for love"
