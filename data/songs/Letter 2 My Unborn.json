I'm a thug 'til I die\n; I'm a rider, mane\nTouch bases, eat lunch in plush places\nRegular criminal oasis awaits us\nIf there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there\nAnd I'm sorry for not bein' there\nJust know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World\nBless the boys and all my little girls\nTo the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace\nPlease take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nPlease take care of all my kids and my unborn child\nTo my unborn child\nThis letter goes out to my seeds\nThat I might not get to see 'cause of this lifestyle\nJust know your daddy loved you\nGot nothin' but love for you\nAnd all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had\n'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind\nWhen you get to be my age, you'll understand\nJust know I got love for you\nAnd I'll see you if there's a ghetto in Heaven\nIf there's a Ghetto Heaven, I'll be there waitin' for you\nHeh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart\nFollow the rules of the game\nI know sometimes there's confusion\nRules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day\nWatch out for these snakes and fakes\nFriends come a dime-a-dozen\nBe an individual, work hard\nStudy, get your mind sharp, trust nobody"
