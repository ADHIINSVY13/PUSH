  "lyrics": "We might have been meant for each other\nTo be or not to be\nLet our hearts discover\nI have a feeling\nIt's a feeling\nI'm concealing\nI don't know why\nIt's just a mental\nIncindental, sentimental alibi\nBut I adore you\nSo strong for you\nWhy go on stalling\nI'm falling\nLove is calling\nWhy be shy\n....\nLet's fall in love\nWhy shouldn't we\nFall in love\nOur hearts are made of it\nLet's take a chance\nWhy be afraid of it\n\nLet's close our eyes\nAnd make our own paradise\nLittle we know of it\nStill we can try\nTo make a go of it\nNow we might have been meant for each other\nTo be or not to be\nLet our hearts discover\nLet's fall in love\nWhy shouldn't we\nFall in love\nNow is the time for it\nWhile we are young\nLet's fall in love\nLet's fall in love\nLet's fall in love"
