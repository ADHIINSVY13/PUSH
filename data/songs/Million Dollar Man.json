I don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nLook like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?\n[Verse 2]\nYou've got the world, but baby, at what price?\nSomething so strange, hard to define\nIt isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you\nI'd follow you down, down, down, you're unbelievable\nIf you're goin' crazy, just grab me and take me\nI'd follow you down, down, down anywhere, anywhere\n[Chorus]\nOne for the money, two for the show\nI love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go\nHow did you get that way? I don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nLook like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Chorus]\nOne for the money and two for the show\nI love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go\nHow did you get that way? I don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nLook like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?\n[Outro]\nI don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nLook like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?"
