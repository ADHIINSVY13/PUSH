Mean]\nOnly haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions\nAnd acquired the desired status of boss livin'\nWe cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish\nPayin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us\nFellas – mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now\nTwo worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers gone wild\nSometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth\nI sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces\nNow, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn\nThe cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn\n[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]\nOctober 9th, 1977, first day out my baby carriage\nMarried my MAC-11, hit the block playing\nOnly five years up in this bitch, Papa running from the feds\nPutting peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints\nMe on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home\nTo protect my zone in these streets I roam\nDough on d-low, downing straight shots of Christian Brothers\nHundred dollar stopwatch on cee-lo, fuck eighth\nI need a kilo, got a plot, move my block downstate\nGot the drop on the spot, moving pounds of weight\nFuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn\nFor this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns\n\n[Overlapped Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper]\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\nIt's gon' be goin' round as the world turns— and steady turnin'\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\nIt's gon' be goin' round as the world turns—\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\nIt's gon' be goin' round as the world turns—\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\nIt's gon' be goin' round as the world turns— and steady turnin'\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\nAs the world keeps turnin' round and round\n[Collision: 2Pac & Napolean]\nHahaha— as the world turns—\nAnd turns and turns and turns— haha\nThis for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle\nHopin' to bubble, keep on hustlin', as the world turns\nMoney come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go, friends come and go— my soldiers stay eternal\nOutlaw Immortalz, dedicated\nI send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us\nWhen you need us, as the world turns\nThrow this shit in the deck, hahah\nNiggas gettin chin checked\nFrom the East to the West, best to wear a vest\nNigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you!\nAs the world turns— Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us\nKamillion, wanna make a million\nHaha legit, as the world turns, haha— burn, baby, burn\n(A lot of niggas get burned as the world turns\nA lot of niggas gettin' burned as the world turns\nGettin' burned as the world turns)"
