  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOh, the leaves are covered in snow\nAnd the water's frozen\nOh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holdin'\nAnd warm me down to my bones\nAs you lay beside me, hold me close\nOh, the leaves are starting to fall\nAnd the sun grows cold\nAnd my heart might break from the weight of it all\nFor all that I know\nYou could be holding somebody else as close\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to\nYet I know that I have never told you\nDarlin', we could fall in lovе 'neath the hills of Aberfеldy\n[Verse 2]\nOh, the ground is slowly melting\nAnd the sun beats strong\nAnd I feel like my feet may have wandered too long\nAnd I will remain here alone\n'Cause I fear that you may have found someone\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm home, I'll hold you like I'm supposed to\nYet I know that I have never told you\nBut, darlin', we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy\nDarling, we could fall in love 'neath the hills of Aberfeldy\n\n[Outro]\nWherever I go, I will always find\nAnother stranger to share in the weight of my crimes\nAnd I know you will never find\nAnother heart that wants you more than mine"
