  "lyrics": "Change is gonna come on my watch\nYes it is my time to arrive in style\nWith grace and poise\nOn my side the noise subsides finally\nYour world is not my world\nMy world, it is my only way\nTo survive the ties that bind\nShake it off, all the dust and the wrong\nAnd the quiet. It’s long overdue\nSo wait right here. I need a little time\nTo take all this in\nYour world is not my world\nMy world, it is my only way\nTo survive the ties that bind\nYour words are not my words\nMy words, they are my only way\nTo survive the ties that bind\nChange is gonna come on my watch\nYes it is"
