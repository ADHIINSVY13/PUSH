Now it's all rusted\nDid you have to hit me\nWhere I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe\nAnd rub it in so deep\nSalt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, it's so sad to\nThink about the good times\nYou and I\n[Chorus]\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood, hey\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you think we'd be fine?\nStill got scars on my back from your knife\nSo don't think it's in the past\nThese kinda wounds, they last and they last\nNow, did you think it all through?\nAll these things will catch up to you\nAnd time can heal, but this won't\nSo if you're comin' my way, just don't\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, it's so sad to\nThink about the good times\nYou and I\n[Chorus]\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey\n[Bridge]\nBand-Aids don't fix bullet holes\nYou say sorry just for show\nIf you live like that, you live with ghosts\nBand-Aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey)\nYou say sorry just for show (Hey)\nIf you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey), mmm\nIf you love like that, blood runs cold\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Bad blood)\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them (Don't think we can solve them)\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood, hey ('Cause now we got bad blood)\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)\n'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Ooh, woah)\nNow we got problems\nAnd I don't think we can solve them\nYou made a really deep cut\nAnd, baby, now we got bad blood, hey"
