  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI sit and watch you readin' with your head low\nI wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed\nI sit and watch you\nI notice everything you do or don't do\nYou're so much older and wiser, and I\n[Chorus]\nI wait by the door like I'm just a kid\nUse my best colors for your portrait\nLay the table with the fancy shit\nAnd watch you tolerate it\nIf it's all in my head, tell me now\nTell me I've got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\n[Verse 2]\nI greet you with a battle hero's welcome\nI take your indiscretions all in good fun\nI sit and listеn\nI polish plates until they gleam and glistеn\nYou're so much older and wiser, and I\n[Chorus]\nI wait by the door like I'm just a kid\nUse my best colors for your portrait\nLay the table with the fancy shit\nAnd watch you tolerate it\nIf it's all in my head, tell me now\nTell me I've got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\n\n[Bridge]\nWhile you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?\nWhere's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?\nI made you my temple, my mural, my sky\nNow I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life\nDrawin' hearts in the byline\nAlways takin' up too much space or time\nYou assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)\n[Chorus]\nBreak free and leave us in ruins?\nTook this dagger in me and removed it\nGain the weight of you, then lose it\nBelieve me, I could do it\nIf it's all in my head, tell me now\nTell me I've got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\n[Outro]\nI sit and watch you"
