  "lyrics": "I'm not here to forget you\nI'm here to recall\nThe things we used to say and do\nI don't want to get over you\nI don't want to get over you\nI haunt the same places\nWe used to go\nAlone at a table for two\nI don't want to get over you\nI don't want to get over you\nOutta give me the wurlitzer prize\nFor all the silver I let slide down the slot\nPlaying those songs so blue\nHelp me remember you\nI don't want to get over you\nA fresh roll of quarters\nSame old song\nMissing you through and through\nI don't want to get over you\nI don't want to get over you\nOutta give me the wurlitzer prize\nFor all the silver I let slide down the slot\nPlaying those songs so blue\nHelp me remember you\nI don't want to get over you\nI don't want to get over you\nI don't want to get over you"
