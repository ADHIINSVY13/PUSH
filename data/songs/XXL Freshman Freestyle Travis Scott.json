  "lyrics": "Lifted, I'm feeling so gifted, tripping, I'm constantly falling\nChannel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley\nDamn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whipping the 'Rari\nOut in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari\nBitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope\nNow only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega\nProenza, the Schouler is all that she know\nMight let the drop top, since she's lamping with the trans am, keep it low\nShe pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line\nListen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business\nMight blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit\nLast spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I don't miss it\nWorld found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that nigga prolly missing\nLa Flame"
