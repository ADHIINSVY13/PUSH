  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNo one ever saw you moving through the dark\nLeaving slips of paper somewhere in the park\nHidden from your friends, stealing all they knew\nLove is thrown in airless rooms, then vile rewards for you\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I'm gonna tell, yes, I've gotta tell\nGotta tell the things you said\nWhen you're talking in the dark\nAnd I'm gonna tell the things you've done\nWhen you're walking through the park\n[Chorus 1]\nSome night on the thrillerâ€™s street\nWill come the silent gun\nYou've got a dangerous heart\nYou stole their trust, their moon, their sun\nThere'll come assassin's needle on a crowded train\nI bet you feel so lonely you could die\n[Verse 2]\nBuildings crammed with people, landscapes filled with wrath\nGray concrete city, rain has wet the street\nI want to see you clearly before you close the door\nA room of bloody history, you made sure of that\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam\nI could read you like a book\nI can feel you falling\nI hear you moaning in your room\nOh, see if I care\nOh, please, please make it soon\n[Chorus 2]\nWalls have got you cornered\nYou've got the blues, my friend\nAnd people don't like you\nBut you will leave without a sound, without an end\nOblivion shall own you\nDeath alone shall love you\nI hope you feel so lonely you could die\nFeel so lonely you could die\nYou feel so lonely you could die"
