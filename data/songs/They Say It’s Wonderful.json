  "lyrics": "They say that falling in love is wonderful\nIt's wonderful, so they say\nAnd, with a moon up above, it's wonderful\nIt's wonderful, so they tell me\nI can't recall who said it\nI know I never read it\nI only know they tell me that love is grand\nAnd\nThe thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful\nIn every way, so they say\nTo leave your house some morning\nAnd, without any warning\nYou're stopping people, shouting that love is grand\nAnd\nTo hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful\nIn every way\nSo they say"
