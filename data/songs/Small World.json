(\nIt's a... small world\n)\n[Verse 2]\nSnook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home\nFrom Attica, known for keepin' chrome calibers\nSmooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it\n5 years plannin' to blow soon as he hit the bridicks\nHad a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low\nPlayed the crib for a month and deaded his P.O\nStarted robbin' niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo\nHe had a bunch of starvin' niggas he owe, he never paid though\nGot large, sign on his door, \"Don't knock hard\"\nLaying with his bitch, \"Niggas is rich\" is what he told her\nPlayed the block, holdin' cracks inside the baby stroller\nHere come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over\nA year went past, Snook went flossing fast\nHis old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a small world (\nIt's a...\n)\nNigga reap what you sow (...\nSmall world\n)\nWhat goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know\nA very small world (\nIt's a...\n)\nWhere beef could never end (\n...Small world\n)\nAt the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again (Again nigga)\nIt's a small world (No doubt) (\nIt's a...\n)\nYou get away with it now (\n...Small world\n)\nSoon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow\nIt's a small world, watch what you do... (\nIt's a small... world, ah-yeah, ah-yeah\n)\n[Verse 3]\nI seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why\nWe let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull another thug dies\nPitchin' your soul into that infinite black hole\nWhere many souls go cause of a .44 blast\nSnook was one of ‘em, so many more\nEven that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah, let that Henny pour\nCarolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich\nHeard her bodyguard took Snook to God\nCarolyn when she needed him, he took the job\nHe was close to her ever since she took him inside\nWhen his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85\nHe went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive\nHe was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried?\nRobbed armored trucks, incidents where police died\nHe stayed in lower Eastside, peace god (\npeace god\n), he stared at me hard\nTwo of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em\nI'm reachin' for my Roscoe, cocked it back on\nAnd get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin'\nOut the way as my Taurus spray\nJump in the whip, hit the highway\nYou know how I say, the game that I play\nIt's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies\nBut can't figure out who's who, keep it true\nShit is cool now, put the tools down? Never\n'Cause everyday is on, livin' this life, out for this \ncheddar\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a small world (\nIt's a...\n)\nNigga you reap what you sow (...\nSmall world\n)\nWhat goes around comes around, if you sleep you won't know\nA very small world (\nIt's a...\n)\nWhere beef never ends (\n...Small world\n)\nAt the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again\nIt's a small world (\nIt's a...\n)\nYou get away with it now (\n...Small world\n)\nSoon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow\nIt's a small world, watch what you do... (\nIt's a... small, world\n)\n[Outro]\nI'm gonna see you again\nUh-huh, I'm gonna see you again, nigga\nUh-huh, gonna see you again, nigga, yeah..."
