Did you call? Did we ever really talk?\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know\nI don't know, I don't\n[Verse 2]\nDear, I wouldn't bet your heart down\nClear but I couldn't get my head around\n[Chorus]\nWas it all any more faded after all?\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know\nAre you sure? Did you call? Did we ever really talk?\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know\n[Outro]\nI've been awake in every\n \nstate line\nDyin' to make it last us a lifetime\nTryin' to shake that it's all on an incline\nFind me a way, I'll be yours in a landslide"
