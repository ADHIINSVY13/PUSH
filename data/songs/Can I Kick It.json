Tryna get to know you\nI know we went to school together, that's the old you\nNever told you how I felt, I feel I owed you\nNever really tried to talk to you because of old you\nBut beautiful, beautiful, beautiful girl\nDon't you walk out my world\nEverything that the boy feel for you, girl\nIt compiles my world\n\n[Bridge: Logic]\nTell me that you're satisfied\nWithout me right by your side\nNo, no, please don't run and hide\nLet your man give you a ride\nNo, no, please don't run and hide\nSkippity, bop, bop, na, na, na, na\nLa da-da-da, la da-da-da, da da da da\n[Refrain: Logic]\nCan I kick it?
