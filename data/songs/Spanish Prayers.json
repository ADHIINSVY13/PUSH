  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAnd on this time before I could tell\nThrew my last wish into the well\nAnd I was making to leave\nJust when you said \"Won't you come home with me?\"\n[Verse 2]\nAnd as we walk I tell you the tale\nOf when I was so broke, wounded and frailed\nThey built a statue of me\nStanding right there\n[?] from the arms of the chair\nFilled up my lungs with [?] air\n[?] inside a jumping balloon\n[Chorus]\nWe’re running into our love\nBanging a spanish drum\nLocked in a cathedral\nDrinking the spanish rum\nWe are members of a clan\nEven if they don't care\nBlowing all the speakers\nSinging a spanish prayer slowly\n[Verse 3]\n[?] tears right to my eyes\nWhat a surprise\nThat I'm here watching you now\nGetting undressed\n[?] dreams with their hearts on their sleeves\nIn the middle of a night makes me cry\nThat I’m looking for you standing right there\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're running into our love\nBanging a spanish drum\nThen we're locked in a cathedral\nDrinking the spanish rum\nWe are members of a clan\nEven if they don't care\nBlowing all the speakers\nSinging a spanish prayer slowly"
