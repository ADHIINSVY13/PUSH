  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStole, forcefully\nForced from me, your body leaves\nFold to your knees\nYour body needs to embody me\n[Hook]\nDecorated in your bed\nEvery second that we had was newlywed\n[Verse 2]\nOh, where we've  been\nAll soaked marine, in kerosine\nStow your love with me\nMy body needs your body heat\n[Hook]\nDecorated in your bed\nEvery second that we had was newlywed\nSeparated in your head\nIn every present that you had, I was a wreck\n[Outro]\nOh, I'm in agony\nYour anatomy has gone\nAnd the hold that you had of me didnâ€™t have any, at all"
