  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIn the streets of New York City\nEvery man can feel the cold\nAnd I don't want no pity\nBut I want my story told\n[Verse 2]\nAnd the lights shine down on me\nThey shine on the little boy\nIs this the way to make him pay\nBeing born in a world of joy?\n[Refrain]\nBut like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong\nHe won't cry so many tears\nTill he finds out why he don't belong\nBut like me, there's no room for us out there\nYou can lose your hope and pride\nWhen it comes to broken dreams, you'll get your share\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes\nA man breaks down\nAnd the good things he is looking for\nAre crushed into the ground\n\n[Chorus]\nGet on up, look around\nCan't you feel the wind of change?\nGet on up, taste the air\nCan't you see the wind of change?\n[Verse 4]\nDo you understand what I'm saying?\nWe need a god down here\nA man to lead us children\nTake us from the valley of fear\n[Verse 5]\nMake the lights shine down on us\nShow us the road to go\nHelp us survive, make us arrive\nTeach us what we need to know\n[Refrain]\nBut like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong\nHe won't cry so many tears\nTill he finds out why he don't belong\nBut like me, there's no room for us out there\nYou can lose your hope and pride\nWhen it comes to broken dreams, you'll get your share\n\n[Verse 6]\nSometimes\nA man breaks down, down, down, down, down\nAnd the good things he's searching for\nAre crushed into the ground\n[Chorus]\nGet on up, look around\nCan't you feel the wind of change?\nGet on up, taste the air\nCan't you see the wind of change?\nGet on up, look around\nCan't you feel the wind of change?\nGet on up, taste the air\nCan't you see the wind of change?\n[Bridge]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n[Chorus]\nGet on up, look around\nCan't you feel the wind of change?\nGet on up, taste the air\nCan't you see the wind of change?\nGet on up, look around\nCan't you feel the wind of change?\nGet on up, taste the air\nCan't you see the wind of change?\nGet on up, look around\nCan't you feel the wind of change?\nGet on up"
