Will you come back to me?\nWill you come back to me? Will you come back to me?\nWill you come back to me? Will you come back to me?\nWill you come back to me? Will you come back to me?\nMake this night the best night\nIt's time for a second chance\nTurn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance\n\n[Chorus]\nHeaven only know, heaven only know\nHeaven only know, heaven only know\nHeaven only know, heaven only know\nHeaven only know, heaven only know"
