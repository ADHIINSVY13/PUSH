  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"Didn't Change My Number\"... I love this song so much. It's all about... you can't... get me anymore. Where it's like \"you know what? I don't sympathy for you anymore. You know, you got me, you got me at first but I don't care now,\" and it's really that, and that only. And, um... kind of just your last straw and being like \"I am confident in this being my last straw\" [laughs]. You know, \"don't get me mad 'cause I will scream.\""
