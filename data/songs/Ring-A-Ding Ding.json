  "lyrics": "Life is dull\nIt's nothing but one big lull\nThen presto you do a skull\nAnd find that you're reeling\nShe sighs and you're feeling\nLike a toy on a string\nAnd your heart goes: \"Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding\"\nHow could that funny face\nThat seemed to be common place\nProject you right in to space\nWithout any warning\nDon't know if its morning, night-time, winter or spring\nWhat's the difference\nRing-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding\nShe takes (grabs) your hand - this captivating creature\nAnd like its planned - you're in the phone book\nLooking (Hunting) for the nearest preacher\nLife is swell\nYou're off to that small hotel\nAnd somewhere a village bell\nWill sound in the steeple\nAnnouncing to people\nLove's the loveliest thing\nAnd the bell goes: \"Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding\""
