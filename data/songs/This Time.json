The song was featured on an episode of The Game.\n[Verse 1]\nRan into you yesterday\nMemories rushed through my brain\nIts starting to hit me\nNow you're not with me\nI realized I made a mistake\nThought that I needed some space\nI just let love go to waste\nIts so crystal clear now\nThat I need you here now\nGot to get you back today\n[Hook]\nThis time I want it all\nThis time I want it all\nI'm showing you all the cards\nGiving you all my heart\nThis time I'll take a chance\nThis time I'll be your man\nI can be all you need\nThis time it's all of me\n[Verse 2]\nI hit the bar every night\nLooking to score a good time\nIts not like I planned it\nBut left empty handed\nCause I'm still alone in my mind\nNow what will it take to feel right\nCan I come see you tonight\nIs there someone new now\nWhat can I do now\nCause I need you back by my side\n\n[Hook]\nThis time I want it all\nThis time I want it all\nI'm showing you all the cards\nGiving you all my heart\nThis time I'll take a chance\nThis time I'll be your man\nI can be all you need\nThis time it's all of me\n[Bridge]\nLast time I wasn't sure\nThis time I will give you more\nI'm more than sure\nI'll show you\nLast time I didn't know\nI messed up when I let you go\nI need you, don't say no\n[Middle 8]\nLying alone in this room\nAll that is missing is you\nPick up the phone\nWon't you come home\n[Hook]\nThis time I want it all\nThis time I want it all\nI'm showing you all the cards\nGiving you all my heart\nThis time I'll take a chance\nThis time I'll be your man\nI can be all you need\nThis time it's all of me"
