  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere is something on my mind that's in my heart written on my face\nAnd it would behove me and my soul if I did state my case\nAnd so as truth is real and real is truth this truly must be told\nThat you've got to be the sweetest somebody I know\n[Verse 2]\nIt's your love for life, your love for God, your love for love and more\nAnd you express your love in ways like I've never known before\nIf there's a record kept on who's the sweetest let the record show\nThat you've got to be the sweetest somebody I know\n[Chorus]\nYou are the sweetest somebody I know\nAnd that is why I can't help but love you so\n[Verse 3]\nIn a time when people are on with making sure that they're okay\nYou pour out your love every second, every minute, every hour of the day\nI'm not trying to blow your horn I'm only saying what is so\nThat you've got to be the sweetest somebody I know\n[Chorus][x2]\n[Bridge]\nWhen I feel like from giving up from seeing all life's pain and strife\nYou rejuvenate me saying everything's gonna be alright\nIf there's a place called \"heaven\" bet my life someday you're gonna go\nCause you've got to be the sweetest somebody I know\n\n[Chorus][x2]"
