  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSomething kind of hit me today\nI looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way\nPeople will hold us to blame\nIt hit me today, it hit me today\n[Verse 2]\nWe're taking it hard all the time\nWhy don't we pass it by?\nJust reply, you've changed your mind\nWe're fighting with the eyes of the blind\nTaking it hard, taking it hard\nYet now\n[Chorus]\nWe feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly\nThey tell me, \"Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far\nFor we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin\nFor you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy\nYou're just an ally of the leacher\"\nLocator for the virgin King, \nbut I love you in your fuck-me pumps\nAnd your nimble dress that trails\nOh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails\nBecause of all we've seen, because of all we've said\nWe are the dead\n\n[Verse 3]\nOne thing kind of touched me today\nI looked at you and counted all the times we had laid\nPressing our love through the night\nKnowing it's right, knowing it's right\n[Verse 4]\nNow I'm hoping some one will care\nLiving on the breath of a hope to be shared\nTrusting on the sons of our love\nThat someone will care, someone will care\n[Chorus]\nBut now\nWe're today's scrambled creatures\nLocked in tomorrow's double feature\nHeaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell\nIt's a twenty-four hour service\n, guaranteed to make you tell\nAnd the streets are full of pressmen\nBent on getting hung and buried\nAnd the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt\nWho sucks you while you're sleeping\nIt's the theatre of financiers\nCount them, fifteen 'round a table\nWhite and dressed to kill\nOh, caress yourself, my juicy\nFor my hands have all but withered\nOh, dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs\nBecause of all we've seen, because of all we've said\nWe are the dead\nWe are the dead\nWe are the dead"
