  "lyrics": "pages 54 & 55\nU say that u'll love me forever but what about today\nAs the dusks become dawns and the years pass on will u love me the same way\nIf so let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure\nIf not spare my heart today and I shall recover before forever\nAnd if my doubts and ?'s upset u, forgive my fragile heart\nI just wanted 2 know if you'd love me forever\nBefore Today would START!"
