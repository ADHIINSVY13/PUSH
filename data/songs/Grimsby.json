  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAs I lay dreaming in my bed\nAcross the great divide\nI thought I heard the trawler boats\nReturning on the tide\nAnd in this vision of my home\nThe shingle beach did ring\nI saw the lights along the pier\nThat made my senses sing\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh, Grimsby, a thousand delights\nCouldn't match the sweet sights\nOf my Grimsby\nOh, England you're fair\nBut there's none to compare\nWith my Grimsby\n[Post-Chorus]\nThrough nights of mad youth\nI have loved every sluice in your harbor\nAnd in your wild sands from boyhood to man\nStrangers have found themselves fathers\n[Verse 2]\nTake me back you rustic town\nI miss your magic charm\nJust to smell your candy floss\nOr drink in the Skinners Arms (Drink in the Skinners Arms)\nNo Cordon Bleu can match the beauty\nOf your pies and peas\nI want to ride your fairground\nTake air along the quay\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh, Grimsby, a thousand delights\nCouldn't match the sweet sights\nOf my Grimsby\nOh, England you're fair\nBut there's none to compare\nWith my Grimsby\n[Post-Chorus]\nThrough nights of mad youth\nI have loved every sluice in your harbor\nAnd in your wild sands from boyhood to man\nStrangers have found themselves fathers\n[Chorus]\nGrimsby, a thousand delights\nCouldn't match the sweet sights\nOf my Grimsby\nOh, England you're fair\nBut there's none to compare\nWith my Grimsby\nGrimsby, a thousand delights\nCouldn't match the sweet sights\nOf my Grimsby\nOh, England you're fair\nBut there's none to compare\nWith my Grimsby"
