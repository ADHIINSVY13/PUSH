Still a target, but the badge is the new noose\nYeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof\nSo we still lose\n\n[Chorus: Jill Scott]\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nI don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek\nWhile they testing your patience, they just testing my reach\nFuneral flowers, every 28 hours\nBeing laid over ours\nSworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?\nLooking over their allowances \nBuilding prisons where the mountains is\nLaptops is for the county kids\nMetal detectors is where ours is\nThey’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history\nThe fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery\nAnd so it goes, every truth don’t get told\nAll these cops get cleared, and lives are stole\nEvery goose don’t lay gold whoa\nJust another nigga dead, just another nigga dead\nSend another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs\nThey call in the National Guard\nPublic Enemy, I am Chuck D\nFlavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P\nWoo! The new elite, it’s either you or me\nLet the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me\n\n[Bridge: Jill Scott]\nIt’s more and more and more than Baltimore\nFrom shore to shore, oh lord\nPatience torn, patience gone, oh lord\n[Chorus: Jill Scott]\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long"
