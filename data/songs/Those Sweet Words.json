  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat did you say?\nI know I saw you singin'\nBut my ears won't stop ringin'\nLong enough to hear those sweet words\nWhat did you say?\n[Verse 2]\nEnd of the day\nThe hour hand has spun\nBut before the night is done\nI just have to hear those sweet words\nSpoken like a melody\n[Chorus]\nAll your love is a lost balloon\nRising up through the afternoon\nTill it could fit on the head of a pin\n[Verse 3]\nCome on in, did you have a hard time sleeping?\n'Cause the heavy moon was keepin' me awake\nAnd all I know is I'm just glad to see you again\n[Chorus 2]\nSee my love like a lost balloon\nRising up through the afternoon\nAnd then you appeared\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat did you say?\nI know what you were singing\nBut my ears won't stop ringing\nLong enough to hear those sweet words\nAnd your simple melody\n[Outro]\nI just have to hear those sweet words\nSpoken like a melody\nI just wanna hear those sweet words"
