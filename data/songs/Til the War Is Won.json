(Bros) Who really is goals? (Goals)\nWho ready to let it go? All the grudges we hold (Uh)\nIt's too many fallen soldiers NY to the 'Go (Chi-Town)\nLate night outside, you hear the forty drum (Baow)\nIn every ghetto and all the slums (For real)\nThese laws made to slaughter us (Damn)\nI give all I have 'til the war is won\n[Verse 3: Lil Durk & \nNas\n]\nI was servin' out my mama crib, she ain't know about it (She ain't know about it)\nComplaining about my rent, but I know my mama got me (My mama got me)\nShe told me to be a man, and never sleep through problems (Sleep through problems)\nUniversity of the streets, I ain't plan on going to college (Oh yeah)\nWhy you crying 'bout low income and welfare? (Ooh)\nYou ain't the only one going through it, this everywhere\nBetter hold your head, I know it don't feel fair\nReason my people dead and they know I still care\nDepending on the people, then you gotta do better\nBlack lives matter, I'm for real, it do matter (For real, it do matter)\nBlack-on-black crime, they still do it to whoever (Whoever)\nTalking to the trenches, we just gotta do better (Do better)\nHe think he Martin Luther, but he tryna be a shooter (Tryna be a shooter)\nGot his car took, he ride with guns in the Uber (In the Uber)\nI'm talking where we from, we carry MACs, but no computers (No computers)\nHe got out yesterday, but he went in when he was juvie (\nChi-Town\n)\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nDiabolical games put on our future kings\nAnd our future queens, y'all the strongest ones (Yeah)\nMay God give strength to women who lost they sons\nI give all I have 'til the war is won\n[Outro: Nas & \nLil Durk\n]\nShe do the best to raise our young\nOoh, she independent and she don't depend on no one\nWe nothing without our women\nOoh, she independent, went from a girl to a woman\nOne love to the single mothers\nOoh, oh, yeah, yeah\nI give all I have 'til the war is won (\nOoh, woah, oh-oh\n)\n'Til the war is won, we gotta stick together\nWomen, stop chasing your man away\nMen, stop acting crazy, chasing your woman away\nWe all we have 'til the war is won, yeah"
