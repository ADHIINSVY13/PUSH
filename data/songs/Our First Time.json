Don't it feel good, baby?\n'Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby\n[Verse 1]\nNa-na-na, here we are (Here we are)\nIn this big old empty room\nStarin' at each other\nWho's gonna make the first move?\nBeen doin' our thing for a minute\nAnd now both our hearts are in it\nThe only place to go is all the way\nAh-ooh\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs that alright? Is that okay?\nGirl, no need to be nervous\n'Cause I've got you all night\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing (No, no, no)\n[Chorus]\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\n\n[Verse 2]\nClothes are not required\nFor what we got planned\nOh, girl, you're my desire\nYour wish is my command\nTreat you like a princess\nOoh, girl, you're so delicious\nLike ice cream on a sunny day\nGonna eat you before you melt away\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs that alright? Is that okay?\nGirl, no need to be nervous (No, no, no, no, oh)\n'Cause I've (I've) got (Got) you (You) all night\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, no, no, no\n[Chorus]\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\n[Refrain]\nDon't it feel good, babe? Don't it feel good, baby?\n'Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby\nDon't it feel good, babe? Don't it feel good, baby?\n'Cause it's so brand new, babe, it's so brand new, baby (Hoo-ooh-hoo, baby)\n\n[Chorus]\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time"
