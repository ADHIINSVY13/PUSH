  "lyrics": "Stop and stare, breathe the air\nNo one cares what you have to say\nSolitude makes me rude\nBut in time, we all laugh and play\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nClose your eyes, close your eyes\nDon't be shy, don't be shy\nIn the dark, you can dance and sway\nFloat up high past the sky\nWhen the night falls, I'll come and stay\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nShelter me into the sea\nI'll find my way back home, back home\nOnly give me what my heart can handle\nPlease, my dear\n\nIn the dark, dark, you don't have to be afraid\nOh, in the night, night, you can learn to laugh and play\nIn the light, light, you can face another day\nWe'll make it right, right, don't you know I'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nIn the dark, dark you don't have to be afraid\nI'm on my way\nOh, in the night, night, you can learn to scream and pray\nI'm on my way\nI'm on my way\nIn the light, light, you can face another day\nI'm on my way\nWe'll make it right, right, don't you know I'm on my way\nI'm on my way"
