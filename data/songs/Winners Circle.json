I'm limitless, I just took the pill\nWhy you think a nigga slow flow so ill?\nBe careful, the shit I got is highly contagious\nWe hustled 'til it had us all locked up in cages\nTime gon' fly when niggas been bidding for ages\nWar stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading\nFor the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan\nWe from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making\nI guess it's all risk versus rewards\nA nigga risk it all for the broads\n(What's up?)\n[Chorus: Guordan Banks]\nAre you ready to win?\nCome join the winners circle\nPut up your hands for me, baby\nAnd do it like we're supposed to\nCause we're gonna win\nCome join the winners circle\nPut up your hands for me, baby\nAnd do it like we're supposed to\nCause we're gonna win"
