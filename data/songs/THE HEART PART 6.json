Kelly, you could thank the Savior\nSaid if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite\nI don't understand why these people praise ya\nSoundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper\nAlbum droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doin' hard labor\nNigga, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia\nAnd Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favor\nAnd when I say I hit ya back, it's a lot safer\nHuh, I promise\n\n[Outro]\nYeah\nI'm not gonna lie, this shit was some, some good exercise, like\nIt's good to get out, get the pen workin'\nYou would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predator\nAnd you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, but\nIt is what it is\nYou definitely got this shit burnt the fuck out though, like\nYou got ten more records to drop\nThe one before the last one, we finessed you into tellin' a story that doesn't even exist\nAnd then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up\nI would like that one, that w—, that-that would be some shit I could dance to if you wasn't\nTriplin' down on some whole other bullshit, but\nYou know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of you\nI'm happy I could motivate you\nBring you back to the game, like\nYou know, but\nJust let me know when we're gettin' to the facts\nEverything in my shit is facts (\nProve it\n)\nI'm waitin' on you to return the favor, like"
