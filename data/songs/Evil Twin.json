  "lyrics": "The b-side to the Suck It And See single, this song tells the tale of a man who manages to score a date with a woman way out of his league, and how the date quickly goes awry.\n[Verse 1]\nYou've never met before\nBut still she greets you like a long lost rock 'n' roll\nShe's definitely one of those\nWhere you'll go wherever she goes\nAnd with my body on\n \nmy mind\nBoth stop talking at the exact same time\nTrying to think of ways to make her mine\nBut they're difficult to find\n[Chorus]\nIt's not what I need\nNo, your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\n[Verse 2]\nAnd she said, \"\nOh\nWell, I know this will sound cold\nBut I really have to go\nNo, it's not that I'm not free\nThere's nowhere I need to be\nIt's just your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\"\n[Chorus]\nIt's not what I need\nNo, your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd she said, \"Baby, how can I believe you?\nHow can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?\nNo point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck\"\n[Verse 3]\nIt's more a hunger than a thirst\nShe'll break your heart the second time\nBefore you know about the first\nLooks well equipped to leave you in the lurch\nBut you'd let her do her worst\nAnd it's not hard to tell\nIt's obvious the other angels' faces fell\nWhen she told him that she had to go\nSwapped her wings and overcoat for something colourful\nTha knows\n[Chorus]\nIt's not what I need\nNo, your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\nNo, your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\nNo, your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\nNo, your love's not what I need\nSo don't give it to me\nYour love's not what I need"
