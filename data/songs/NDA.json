(No)\nHad to save my money for security\nGot a stalker walkin' up and down the street\nSays he's Satan and he'd like to meet\nI bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)\nHaven't had a party since I got the keys\nHad a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay\nOn his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm\nYeah, I made him sign an NDA\nOnce was good enough\n'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh\n[Chorus]\nYou couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no\nI can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh\n[Verse 2]\nMm, mm-mm, mm\n30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)\nI can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (I think I hate it here)\nMaybе I should think about a new career (Uh)\nSomewhere in Kauai where I can disappear\nI've been havin' fun gettin' older now\nDidn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)\nAt least I gave him somethin' he can cry about\nI thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh\nWant it now, mm-mm-mm\nYou can't give me up\n\n[Chorus]\nYou couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no\nI can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh\n[Outro]\nDid I take it too far?\nNow I know what you are\nYou hit me so hard\nI saw stars\nThink I took it too far\nWhen I sold you my heart\nHow'd it get so dark?\nI saw stars\nStars"
