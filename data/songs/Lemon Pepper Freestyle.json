tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure\nYes, uh\nBiggest, you feel me? \n(\nM-M-M-Maybach Music\n)\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nGodfather with a garden full of snakes\nCall Porsche, time to give away a Wraith\nBricks, boy, time to turn 'em into base\nBig Boi got me tryna buy the Braves\nCourtroom soundin' like I'm in an opera\nWent and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us\nBitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars\nBut it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it\nFat boy, rich nigga, with a appеtite\nCountin' money all night under thе candlelight\nSpinnin' vinyl, Teddy P, or is it Lionel?\nNot a model, but I know I been your idol\nBig bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter\nOn fire 'cause I'm just a different writer\nPracticin' social distance with all these snitch niggas\nGuess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us\nBig bucks, steppin' outta big trucks\nSteppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up\nGot the squad with me and all they did was gimme love\nFoot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub\nG-Wagen for my bitch, now, girl, go live it up\nDeath Row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up\nMakaveli, it's all eyes on me\nPinkie rings, it's still M.O.B.\n \n(\nM-M-M-Maybach Music\n)\n\n[Interlude]\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure\nTryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nYeah, heart just turned purple\nThree-sixty up front, it all comes full circle\nClass photographs, Sandi had me on my Urkel\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nPatty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid\nSigned, sealed, delivered, I forward the note to Republic\nShe witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nYeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get the leverage\nGroundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges\nI took two mill' out the cage down in the desert\nMatthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'\n\"The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino\"\nReal life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo\nOne truck in front of me, one behind me to follow\nLemme get a lemon pepper order, please\nYou gotta have the link before you order these\nDockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys\nWe all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me\nYou just found a bottle with the messages\nThese days, fame is disconnected from excellence\nHalf the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is\nUshered a generation in, these are where my confessions live\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nI did brunch with the judge we appearin' before\nPrivate villas only, I don't go near a resort\nWe want everything galore, not just Lira Galore\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nFor real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan\nI sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji\nThey all say they love me, but they hardly know me\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nYeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man\nRecess hits, daddy prolly made another M\nSchool bell rings and I'm out there to get him again\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nYeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed\nRegardless of what they husbands do to provide\nAskin' if I know Beyoncé or Nicki Minaj\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nOf course\nPull up to the front in a fleet of Suburbans\nFlooded French immersion with the Secret Service\nShit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose\nIf this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker\nChampagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica\nStarted at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya\nRoss sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nAnd that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)\nMansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)\nDubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)\nAll my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)\nMansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)\nLemme know if that's a problem\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nIf you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it\nUsed to say I had it 'fore I got it, now I got it all\nAnd bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it\nAnd if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it\nI had it so long, I don't even celebrate it\nNegative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix\n'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nDamn, not too many parallels left in our lives\nI mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes\nAnd the squad look bigger to the young guys\nAnd my dick feel better when you drunk, right?\nSpend nighttime starin' at the sunrise\nAnd my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye\nAir Canada Centre nigga when I die\nY'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry\nFirst couple rows, you gon' see the real guys\nThe ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause the trunk size\nThe ones that look at other rappers like it's lunchtime\nWatch on my wrist never showed me crunch time\n'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time\nTo be real, man, I never did one crime\nBut none of my brothers could caption that line \n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nAt all, kill me, that's talent God wasted\nInstant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it\nWhen mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics\nInstant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it\nNow it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted\nNiggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'\nBig body frames, wasn't into car racin'\nMe and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'\nI always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'\nLivin' in the 6ix, eight weeks, sun blazin'\nAfter that, the killies just go into hibernation\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nDamn, rest in peace Dolla Bill\nHow I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?\nHow I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?\n(\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\n)\nEverybody that survive got survivor's guilt\nMy label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills\nMy boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill\nYou niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk\nAnd your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills\nIt's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure\nI been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'\nTo get you under my pressure"
