  "lyrics": "“Good Grief” describes the painful and annoying struggle of defeat and being let down. It can often be perceived as a benefit at first, but it quickly becomes a burden.\n[Verse 1]\nSince I'm puttin' down\nAll of the true things around, but I like it\nHanded down my crown\nGiven the jewels and the answers of May\nThe thought of bein' ousted\nComes and goes, comes and goes\nWhen I think about it\nThe wind blows\n[Hook]\nHate it, hate it, hate it, hate it\nHate it, hate it, hate it\n[Verse 2]\nRun me out of town\nSomewhere a move might intended a gown at\nPissed at all the bowels\nAlways the blues and a delicate smile\nMissed all of the sideways\nGull and noun, gull and noun\nChills and petty Band-Aids\nWrapped around\n[Hook]\nHate it, hate it, hate it, hate it\nHate it, hate it, hate it\n\n[Bridge]\nGood grief\nGood grief\n[Verse 1]\nSince I'm puttin' down\nAll of the true things around, but I like it\nHanded down my crown\nGiven the jewels and the answers of May\nThe thought of bein' ousted\nComes and goes, comes and goes\nWhen I think about it\nThe wind blows\n[Hook]\nHate it, hate it, hate it, hate it\nHate it, hate it, hate it"
