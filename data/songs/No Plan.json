  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHere, there's no music here\nI'm lost in streams of sound\nHere, am I nowhere now?\nNo plan\nWherever I may go\nJust where, just there\nI am\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of the things that are my life\nMy desire, my beliefs, my moods\nHere is my place without a plan\n[Verse 2]\nHere, second avenue\nJust out of view\nHere, is no traffic here?\nNo plan\n[Chorus 2]\nAll the things that are my life\nMy moods, my beliefs\nMy desires, me alone\nNothing to regret\nThis is no place, but here I am\nThis is not quite yet"
