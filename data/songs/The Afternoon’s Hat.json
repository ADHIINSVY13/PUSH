  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMade me kiss ya with a whisper\nAnd violently you swung through unfamiliar tongue\nCouldn't listen to tradition\nGrabbed me by the wrist to silently insist\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm in the confines of crawling walls\nYou hold me in place\nThe ripples on the ceiling, \nthe avenues\nUnsugared taste\nWe'll waste away the evening, \nthe afternoon\nAnd the afternoon's hat\nTogether we'll find something\nTo direct some laughter at\n[Verse 2]\nYou stood shirtless and confident\nListening to the fools, tickling the rules\nTheir obsessions followed patterns\nSat upon their stools with their attitudes\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm in the confines of crawling walls\nYou hold me in place\nThe ripples on the ceiling, \nthe avenues\nUnsugared taste\nWe'll waste away the evening, \nthe afternoon\nAnd the afternoon's hat\nTogether we'll find something\nTo direct some laughter at\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nAnd when I'm in the confines of crawling walls\nYou hold me in place\nThe ripples on the ceiling, \nthe avenues\nUnsugared taste\nWe'll waste away the evening, \nthe afternoon\nAnd the afternoon's hat\nTogether we'll find something\nTo direct some laughter at"
