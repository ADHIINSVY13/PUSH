  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat did you think I'd say to that?\nDoes a scorpion sting when fighting back?\nThey strike to kill, and you know I will\nYou know I will\nWhat do you sing on your drive home?\nDo you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?\nDoes she smile?\nOr does she mouth, \"Fuck you forever\"?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery time you call me crazy, I get more crazy\nWhat about that?\nAnd when you say I seem angry, I get more angry\n[Chorus]\nAnd there's nothing like a mad woman\nWhat a shame she went mad\nNo one likes a mad woman\nYou made her like that\nAnd you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out\nAnd you find something to wrap your noose around\nAnd there's nothing like a mad woman\n[Verse 2]\nNow I breathe flames each time I talk\nMy cannons all firin' at your yacht\nThey say, \"Move on,\" but you know I won't\nAnd women like hunting witches too\nDoing your dirtiest work for you\nIt's obvious that wanting me dead\nHas really brought you two together\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery time you call me crazy, I get more crazy\nWhat about that?\nAnd when you say I seem angry, I get more angry\n[Chorus]\nAnd there's nothing like a mad woman\nWhat a shame she went mad\nNo one likes a mad woman\nYou made her like that\nAnd you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out\nAnd you find something to wrap your noose around\nAnd there's nothing like a mad woman\n[Bridge]\nI'm taking my time, taking my time\n'Cause you took everything from me\nWatching you climb, watching you climb\nOver people like me\nThe master of spin has a couple side flings\nGood wives always know\nShe should be mad, should be scathing like me, but\nNo one likes a mad woman\n[Outro]\nWhat a shame she went mad\nYou made her like that"
