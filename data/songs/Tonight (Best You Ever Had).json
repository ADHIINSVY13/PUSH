Let me fix that\nTwist that\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight, I'll be the best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\n[Verse 2: John Legend]\nI hit you with the best stroke\nFreestyle and then the breaststroke\n'Til you're blowin' cigarette smoke\nAnd now the beds broke\nSo what we gon' do now?\nFuck it, round two now\nWork it out, then we cool down\nCool down\n\n[Chorus: John Legend & \nLudacris\n]\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight, I'll be the best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be (\nI don't wanna brag\n)\n(\nGive me a little bit of that light-skinned love, baby\n)\nThe best you ever had\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nLuda! Listen\nYou ain't even gotta text me\nKnowin' me and you got that mental telepathy\nMe be up at the spot, I'll be sendin' over the chauffeur\nRich nigga, \nbread stay poppin' like a toaster\nNobody, come close to me and you together\nStep under my umbrella\nWe'll make it through any weather\nExcept when I make it storm\nSex in the greatest form\nAnd hibernate under my body\nYep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla\nShe know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila\nFlyin' my private jet to villas in Anguilla\nThen throw you on a grill\nThat's 'cause seven days a week youâ€™re my five-course meal for real\n\n[Chorus: John Legend & \nLudacris\n]\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know (Baby, tonight)\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control (\nWoo! It's gon' be tonight, baby\n)\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight, I'll be the best you ever had (Be the best you ever had)\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be (I don't wanna brag)\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had"
