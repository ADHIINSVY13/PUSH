  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAs you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined\nYou must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive\nBecause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign\nKept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right\nNow I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face\nAnd memories are somethin' even smoking weed cannot replace\nAnd I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains\nDoc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks\nAnd I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed\nAnd it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim\nI'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas\nAnd I'll dream each night of some version of you\nThat I might not have, but I did not lose\nNow you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes\nAnd I'm split in half, but that'll have to do\n[Verse 2]\nSo I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad\nThat I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad\nNo, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh\nYou once called me \"forever,\" now you still can't call me back\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks\nAnd I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed\nAnd it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim\nI'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas\nAnd I'll dream each night of some version of you\nThat I might not have, but I did not lose\nNow you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes\nAnd I'm split in half, but that'll have to do\n[Bridge]\nOh, that'll have to do\nMy other half was you\nI hope this pain's just passin' through\nBut I doubt it\n[Chorus]\nAy, I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks\nAnd I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed\nAnd it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim\nI'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas\nAnd I'll dream each night of some version of you\nThat I might not have, but I did not lose\nNow you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes\nAnd I'm split in half, but that'll have to do\nHave to do"
