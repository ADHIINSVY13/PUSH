  "lyrics": "“Love is Lost” details the perils of success. The story starts with a fresh-voiced 22 year old, follows him through stardom, and the sad, lonely, years after he’s made it big.\n[Verse 1]\nIt's the darkest hour, you're 22\nThe voice of youth, the hour of dread\nThe darkest hour, and your voice is new\nLove is lost, lost is love\n[Verse 2]\nYour country's new, your friends are new\nYour house and even your eyes are new\nYour maid is new and your accent, too\nBut your fear is as old as the world\n[Chorus]\nSay goodbye to the thrills of life\nWhen love was good, no love was bad\nWave goodbye to the life without pain\nSay hello, you're a beautiful girl\n[Chorus]\nSay hello to the lunatic men\nTell them your secrets, they're like the grave\nOh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?\nLove is lost, lost is love\nYou know so much, it’s making you cry\nYou refuse to talk, but you think like mad\nYou've cut out your soul and the face of thought\nOh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?\nOh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?"
