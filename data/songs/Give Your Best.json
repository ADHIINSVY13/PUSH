Grab partners\n[Verse 1]\nI'm just a clown that used to run around\nI used to have a million friends\nI used to start where everybody ends\nBut I just give my best to my friends\n[Verse 2]\nI've done my shows, everybody knows\nI nearly sold all my clothes\nOne man can give, another has to lend\nSo I just give my best to my friends\n(And so you should)\n[Chorus]\nAnd when you think that your life isn't right\nYou know the day isn't always like night\nYou've had your peace, now it's time for you to fight\nJust give your best to your friends\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm just a clown that used to run around\nI used to have a million friends\nI used to start where everybody ends\nSo I just give my best to my friends\n[Chorus]\nAnd when you think that your life isn't right\nYou know the day isn't always like night\nYou've had your peace, now it's time for you to fight\nJust give your best to your friends\n[Chorus/Outro]\nAnd when you think that your life isn't right\nYou know the day isn't always like night\nYou've had your peace, now it's time for you to fight\nJust give your best to your friends\nAnd just give your best to your friends"
