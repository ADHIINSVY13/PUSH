If I wasn't driving\nIf I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga\nWould you come around me, or would you clown me?\nIf I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya\nPut your two lips on my wood and kiss it? Could ya\nSee yourself with a nigga working hard at a nine to five\nTen to six, two jobs to survive,\n \nor\nDo you need a baller? So you can shop and tear the mall up\nBrag, tell your friends what I bought ya\nIf you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low\nBaby girl, if this is so, yo\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z & \nAmil\n]\nCan I get a \"fuck you\" –\nTo these bitches from all of my niggas\nWho don't love hoes, they get no dough?\nCan I get a \"woop woop\" –\nTo these niggas from all of my bitches\nWho don't got love for niggas without dubs?\nCan I get a \"fuck you\" –\nTo these bitches from all of my niggas\nWho don't love hoes, they get no dough?\nCan I get a \"woop woop\" –\nTo these niggas from all of my bitches\nWho don't got love for niggas without dubs?\n[Break: Jay-Z & \nAmil\n]\nNow can you bounce wit me? uhh\nBounce wit me, bounce wit me\nCan ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me?\nUh uh..
