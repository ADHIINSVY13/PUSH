  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI want to find out where the moon goes\nWhen it leaves the western sky\nAnd night dissolves again 'til morning\nAzure turns to gold\nAzure turns to gold\n[Verse 2]\nI'm gonna sleep with one eye open\nI'm gonna keep the shades half-drawn\nNearly silent, dressed in shadows\nLines and colors fall\nLines and colors fall\n[Verse 3]\nI'm gonna watch her through my window\nJust as I watched you before\nA smile knows, but just won't tell me\nI just watch her go\nI just watch her go\n[Verse 4]\nNow I know just where the moon goes\nWhen it leaves the western sky\nAnd night dissolves again 'til morning\nThe moon is in your eyes\nThe moon is in your eyes\nThe moon is in your eyes\nThe moon is in your eyes"
