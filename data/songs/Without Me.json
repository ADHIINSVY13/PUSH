You sent for me?\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow, this looks like a job for me\nSo, everybody, just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo, everybody, just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nA tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'\nAnybody who's talkin', \"This shit, that shit\"\nChris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked\nWorse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards\nAnd Moby? You can get stomped by Obie\nYou thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me\nYou don't know me, you're too old, let go\nIt's over, nobody listens to techno\nNow, let's go, just give me the signal\nI'll be there with a whole list full of new insults\nI've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil\nEver since Prince turned himself into a symbol\nBut, sometimes, the shit just seems\nEverybody only wants to discuss me\nSo this must mean I'm disgusting\nBut it's just me, I'm just obscene\n (Yeah)\nThough I'm not the first king of controversy\nI am the worst thing since Elvis Presley\nTo do Black music so selfishly\nAnd use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)\nThere's a concept that works\nTwenty million other white rappers emerge\nBut no matter how many fish in the sea\nIt'd be so empty without me\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow, this looks like a job for me\nSo, everybody, just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo, everybody, just follow me\n'Cause we need a little controversy\n'Cause it feels so empty without me\n[Outro: Eminem]\nHum, dei-dei, la-la\nLa-la, la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la\nHum, dei-dei, la-la\nLa-la, la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la-la\nLa-la, la-la\nKids"
