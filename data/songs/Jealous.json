It's just habits\nYou not supposed to take advantage\nConstant pain, I feel abandoned\nKeep it together, don't do damage\nDon't you treat me like I'm average\nI don't know why you make me jealous\nSex with you, it must be heaven\nPurchase carats look like pebbles\nWhy try fight it? It's just habits\n[Verse 1]\nCall up the jeweler, that's just one call\nDon't take kindness for weakness\nMake me stronger, no weakness\nI just need you to believe in\nI just need you to be happy\nI know you won't steer me wrong\nThis fifteen carats, canary yellow\nTryna trick myself thinking this forever with you\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know why you make me jealous\nSex with you, it must be heaven\nPurchase carats look like pebbles\nHope you deserve it, \nyou the baddest\nYou not supposed to take advantage\nConstant pain, I feel abandoned\nKeep it together, don't do damage\nDon't you treat me like I'm average\n[Post-Chorus]\nI don't know why you make me jealous\nSex with you, it must be heaven\nI don't know why you make me jealous\n(Sex with you, it must be heaven)\nI don't know why you make me jealous\n[Verse 2]\nRose gold, buy a Patek\nTreat you with care, I can't be careless\nI get so jealous, might just panic\nKissing your body, taste like candy\nI wanna love you, not be managed\nBackground Italian, speaking Spanish\nTryna keep it simple, we so lavish\nGood for my mental, doing magic\nLet's find a spot somewhere in Paris\nMove to the mountains far from madness for you\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know why you make me jealous (Jealous)\nSex with you, it must be heaven (Sex with you, it must be heaven)\nPurchase carats look like pebbles (Purchase carats like pebbles)\nWhy try fight it?
