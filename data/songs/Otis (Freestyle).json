Guess that makes two\nBut I never knew that dreams really came true\nStarted playing drums when I was only two\nNow we kick it in Japan, kung-fu\nSo I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating\nI swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready\nI already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny\nAnd we steady getting many, I mean money\nRiding in an all-black Benz with the all-black rims\nAnd we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses\n[Interlude: Justin Bieber]\nWait, I'm not done\n[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]\nI thanked Jesus at the awards, I'm never going to hell\nCall me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell\nMy girl says I'm perfect, she just loves an imperfect person perfectly\nPersonally, I think she is perfectly perfect\nI get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me\nI swear I got a hundred of these 'cause baby, I'm a money tree\nSo be my little honey, be my little-bitty bunny\nI got honeys all up on me, baby, I just get it done-y\nPossibly, you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible\nAnd logically, well probably, but you just take me lyrically\nTry to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally\nThere's a bigger me inside this little me screaming out\nI should make history, I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me\nRun up on my enemies, see if they remember me\nSoon as they remember me, I wipe away their memory\nCan't you see the private jets flying over you?\nI ain't even notice, but my focus on my photos\nMight be bogus, no, they shouldn't be a photoshoot\nIt's funny how you wanna take my picture and\n \nit's like your first time\nPlaying with camera claiming that it's not mine\nJust calm down, you don't gotta hurry\nDon't be nervous, you don't gotta worry\nAnd my fans are like my glasses, yeah, without them, I'd be blurry\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nSwag"
