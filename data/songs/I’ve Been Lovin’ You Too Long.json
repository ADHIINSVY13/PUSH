  "lyrics": "I've been lovin' you too long\nTo stop now\nYou were tired\nAnd you want to be free\nMy love is growing stronger\nAs you become a habit to me\nI've been lovin' you\nWay too long\nI don't wanna stop now\nWith you, my life\nHas been so wonderful\nI can't, I can't stop now\nYou were tired and your love is growing cold\nMy love is growing stronger\nAs our affair, our affair grows old\nI've been lovin' you--\nHey--\nA little too long\nI don't wanna stop now\nI've been lovin' you\nA little too long\nI don't wanna, I don't wanna stop now\nOh, don't make me stop now\nPlease don't make, don't make me stop now\nI love you I love you I love you, oh, don't make me stop now\nDon't make me stop now\nPlease baby don't make me\nDon't make me stop now, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna stop now\n\nI've been lovin' you too long\nI don't wanna stop now"
