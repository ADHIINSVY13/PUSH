  "lyrics": "This moment, this minute\nAnd each second in it\nWill leave a glow upon the sky\nAnd as time goes by, it will never die\nThis will be my shining hour\nCalm and happy and bright\nAnd in my dreams, your face will flower\nThrough the darkness of the night\nLike the lights of home before me\nOr an angel who's watching o'er me\nThis will be my shining hour\n'Til I'm with you again\nLike the lights of home before me\nOr an angel watching o'er me\nThis will be my shining hour\n'Til I'm with you again"
