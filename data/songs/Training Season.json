'Cause I've been there\nAnd, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut if you really wanna go there\nYou should know I\n[Chorus]\nNeed someone to hold me close\nDeeper than I've ever known\nWhose love feels like a rodeo\nKnows just how to take control\nWhen I'm vulnerable\nHe's straight talking to my soul\nConvеrsation overload\nGot me feeling vertigo\n[Post-Chorus]\nArе you somebody who can go there?\n'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya\nIf that ain't you, then let me know, yeah\n'Cause training season's over\n(Training season's over)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried\nTo see my lovers in a good light\nDon't wanna do it just to be nice\nDon't wanna have to teach you how to love me right\nI hope\nIt hits me like an arrow\nSomeone with some potential\nIs it too much to ask for?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho understands I\n[Chorus]\nNeed someone to hold me close\nDeeper than I've ever known\nWhose love feels like a rodeo\nKnows just how to take control\nWhen I'm vulnerable\nHe's straight talking to my soul\nConversation overload\nGot me feeling vertigo\n[Post-Chorus]\nAre you somebody who can go there?\n'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya\nIf that ain't you, then let me know, yeah\n'Cause training season's over\n\n[Bridge]\nCan you compete? Now is your time\nRun when you hear that whistle blow\nAre you on my team or stuck on the sidelines\nWaiting for someone to tell you to go?\nFor someone to tell you to go\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou should know I\n[Chorus]\nNeed someone to hold me close\nDeeper than I've ever known\nWhose love feels like a rodeo\nKnows just how to take control\nWhen I'm vulnerable\nHe's straight talking to my soul (If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah)\nConversation overload\n[Outro]\n'Cause training season's over\n'Cause training season's over\nTraining season's over"
