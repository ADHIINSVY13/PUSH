  "lyrics": "How did you find there was somebody\nMore than you want me\nI never understood\nMaybe I have never had you\nI have been lonely for you lately\nI can't wait another day\nAnd when you let me get you close to me\nYou run and leave me\nPaying the price of love\nThe start of my end over you\nWhen you're doin' it for someone\nWho'll never be free\nNow is all there will ever be\nNo more to live without you\nAll the nights I dream about you\nDeep in the dark of the night\nI'm a man on a mission\nBut safer with you home\nNever would I make you sorry\nYou are the only drug I crave\nAnd I've been saving everyday\nI held it all inside, I pray\nYou don't forget you got me\n\nPaying the price of love\nMy heart in my hands over you\nBut the battle is just not fair\nYou'll never be free\nThat emotion is always replaying\nYou know the strongest heart\nIs broken when it falls\nYou turn and walk away\nAnd let it die\nI got this picture in my head\nOf you in someone else's bed\nAnd I am torn apart\nI'm torn apart inside\nI'll build my world around you\nI was nothing when I found you\nPaying the price of love\nPaying the price of love\nThe start of my end over you\nWhen you're doing it for someone\nWho'll never be free\nNow is all there will ever be\nPaying the price of love\nMy heart in my hands over you\nBut the battle is just not fair\nYou'll never be free\nThat emotion is always replaying"
