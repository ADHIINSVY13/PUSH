  "lyrics": "I love to see them straw dogs 'round my door\nCome sneaking 'round my skirt tail looking for more\nIf you ain't running from the past\nYou ain't making my heart beat fast\nYou ain't chugging your paycheck\nYou ain't hugging on my neck\nWell, I've been looking for trouble from the git\nThem cowboys back where I come from won't quit\nCutting up tires on an oyster shell\nSiren screaming and he's running like hell\nMomma's on the front porch staring him down\nLadies at the beauty shop coming unwound\nIf the law don't want you, neither do I\nI ain't got no time to waste my shine\nOn a puppet with a clip-on tie\nIf the law don't want you, neither do I\nI hired that boy to cut my grass\nNailed down a shingle but it couldn't get past\nStaring at the bottom of his low-slung pants\nSays he's gonna take me to the big buck dance\nIf the law don't want you, neither do I\n\nI used to run wild down in Mexico\nHair jacked up and necklines plunging low\nSome snake hip shirt rip giving me lip\nRifling my purse and stealing my tips\nThere's something 'bout a man can affect that lean\nKeeping his hat all yanked down mean\nIf the law don't want you, neither do I\nPlay born to lose and you light my fuse\nI'm a sucker for a bald-faced lie"
