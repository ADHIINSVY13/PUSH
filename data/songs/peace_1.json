  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOur coming-of-age has come and gone\nSuddenly, this summer, it's clear\nI never had the courage of my convictions\nAs long as danger is near\nAnd it's just around the corner, darlin'\n'Cause it lives in me\nNo, I could never give you peace\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm\nIf your cascade, ocean wave blues come\nAll these people think love's for show\nBut I would die for you in secret\nThe devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me\nWould it be enough if I could never give you peace?\n[Verse 2]\nYour integrity makes me seem small\nYou paint dreamscapes on the wall\nI talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor\nAnd you know that I'd swing with you for the fences\nSit with you in the trenches\nGive you my wild, give you a child\nGive you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other\nFamily that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother\nIs it enough?\nBut there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west\nI'd give you my sunshine, give you my best\nBut the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm\nIf your cascade, ocean wave blues come\nAll these people think love's for show\nBut I would die for you in secret\nThe devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me\nWould it be enough if I could never give you peace?\nWould it be enough if I could never give you peace?\nWould it be enough if I could never give you peace?"
