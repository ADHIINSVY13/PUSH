  "lyrics": "The preacher talked with me and he smiled\nSaid, \"Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile\nNow, for once in your life, you're alone\nBut you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone\"\nI've just gotta get a message to you\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\nI told him I'm in no hurry\nBut if I broke her heart then won't you tell her I'm sorry?\nAnd for once in my life I'm alone\nAnd I got to let her know just in time before I go\nI've just gotta get a message to you\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\nWell, I laughed but that didn't hurt\nAnd it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt\nNow, I'm crying but deep down inside\nWell, I did it to him, now, it's my turn to die\nI've just gotta get a message to you\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through\nHold on, hold on\nHold on\nI've just gotta get a message to her\nHold on, hold on\nOne more hour and my life will be through"
