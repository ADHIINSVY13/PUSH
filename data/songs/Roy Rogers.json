  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSometimes you dream, sometimes it seems\nThere's nothing there at all\nYou just seem older than yesterday\nAnd you're waiting for tomorrow to call\nYou draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain\nYou're cozy in your little room\nThe carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV\nLet's go shoot a hole in the moon\n[Chorus]\nOh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight\nReturning to our silver screens\nComic book characters never grow old\nEvergreen heroes whose stories were told\nOh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains\nOf roundups and rustlers and home on the range\nTurn on the TV, shut out the lights\nRoy Rogers is riding tonight\n[Verse 2]\nNine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings\nI'd liven the pace if I could\nOh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese\nBut complaining wouldn't do any good\nLay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear\nI can hear hoofbeats ahead\nRoy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop\nWhile the wife and the kids are in bed\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight\nReturning to our silver screens\nComic book characters never grow old\nEvergreen heroes whose stories were told\nOh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains\nOf roundups and rustlers and home on the range\nTurn on the TV, shut out the lights\nRoy Rogers is riding tonight"
