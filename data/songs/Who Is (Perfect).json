(Oh)\nShe wanted someone that's perfect\nOkay, but can you tell me who is?\n(Oh, oh, oh)\n(Oh, oh oh)\n[Verse 2]\nShe set the bar just above the stars\nA rocket couldn't reach it, but I still kept on reaching\nShe watched me try at least a thousand times\nIf she loved me she'd stopped me, but no (Oh)\n[Chorus]\nI know I'm not perfect (Oh)\nBut at the end of the day who is? (Oh)\nShe wanted someone that's perfect\nOk, but can you tell me who is?\n\n[Bridge]\nI saw something worth my future\nSo wrong, so wrong\nIn my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong (Oh)\n[Chorus]\nI know I'm not perfect (Oh)\nBut at the end of the day who is? (Oh)\nShe wanted someone that's perfect\nOkay, but can you tell me who is?\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh"
