  "lyrics": "Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car\nNow she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star\nDraped around my kitchen sink, Happy as can be\nI just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me\nI'm not much to look at, nothing to see\nJust glad I'm livin' and lucky to be\nI got a woman crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nI can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent\nShe doesn't holler she'd live in a tent\nI got a woman crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nTho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day\nShe'd be so much better off if I went away\nBut why should I leave her, why should I go\nShe'd be unhappy without me I know\nI got a woman crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nShe should have the very best, Anyone can see\nStill she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me\nWhile I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do\nCan't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true\n\nNever had nothin'; no one to care\nThat's why I seem to have more than my share\nI got a woman, crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nWhen I hurt her feelings, once in a while\nHer only answer is one little smile\nI got a woman crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nI can see no other way and no better plan\nEnd it all and let her go to some better man;\nBut I'm only human, coward at best\nI'm more than certain she'd follow me west\nI got a woman crazy for me\nShe's funny that way"
