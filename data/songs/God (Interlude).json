To his surprise, God turns out to be a female and answers his requests with some extreme swiftness.\n[Spoken Word]\nGod\nCome in, God\nGod, come in, God\nDamn, you're a girl? Wow\nI guess the reason I'm talkin' to you tonight is\nBecause I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' and\nAnd I consider myself a pretty cool guy\nAnd I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends\nWell, well, except that one little time in Japan, but\nThat was just some head, and head don't count, right?\nAh, thanks God, I knew you'd understand\nWell, I just feel like\nWell, to be honest with you\nGod, I just need a sweet bitch\nYou know somebody not too\nNot too fast, but not too slow\n'Cause I don't have it all my damn self\nAnd life ain't easy\nYou know, you just want somebody by your side\nTo help smooth that thang out, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?\nAnd at this point, I mean, I'm not bein' picky\nShe doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass, you know?\nJust something well proportioned to her body\nYou know, a nice little tail, you know?\nWhat? You say you, you say you found somebody?\nIs she cute? So when do I get to meet her?\nOh God, you're the greatest\nWell, I guess I'll talk to you later\nAmen\nOh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry\nA-lady"
