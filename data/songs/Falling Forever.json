How long?\n[Verse 1]\nAre you good at holding on?\nI know the mind is quick to throw away the moment\nWhere this takes us, maybe I don't wanna know yet\n'Cause for now, you're all I want\nThey say you got it, then it's gone\nI don't believe that every flame has to get colder\nI hope the feelings that you give me carry over\nTill tomorrow and beyond\n[Chorus]\nHow long, how long\nCan it just keep getting better?\nCan we keep falling forever?\nHow long, how long\nCan we stay like this together?\nCan we keep falling forever?\n[Verse 2]\nYou could wake up all alone\nSo tonight, I'll give you something to remember\nAnd eternity's impossible to measure\nBut it feels right where we are\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm (\nI'm\n) falling deep (\nFalling deep\n)\nDeep in your arms, baby\nBaby, I'm yours to keep\nKeep me close\nTill tomorrow and beyond\n[Chorus]\nHow long, how long\nCan it just keep getting better?\nCan we keep falling forever?\nHow long, how long\nCan we stay like this together?\nCan we keep falling forever?\n[Bridge]\n(How long)\nI wanna know\nCan you ride through any storm?\nCan you ride from night till dawn?\nTill tomorrow and beyond\n[Chorus]\nHow long, how long\nCan it just keep getting better?\nCan we keep falling forever?\nHow long, how long\nCan we stay like this together?\nCan we keep falling forever?\n\n[Outro]\nHow long\nCan it just keep getting better?\nCan we keep falling forever?\nOh, ooh-ooh\nHow long?\nHow, how long?"
