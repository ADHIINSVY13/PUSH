  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nStars in my eyes,\n \nhiking up Griffith\nThinking about who was sad and what didn't\nGet said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now\nI wrote you a note, but I didn't send it\n'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about\nWhat you don't really understand\nI've got magic in my hand, stars in my eyes\n[Chorus]\nI'm a different kind of woman\nIf you want some basic bitch, go to the Beverly Center and find her\nI'm sweet, bare feet\nIf you wanna go where nobody goes\nThat's where you'll find me\nIn the sweet north country\nIf I'm not there, comе to my house on Genesee\n[Bridge]\nWhat you doin' with your lifе? Do you think about it?\nDo you contemplate where we came from?\nLately, we've been makin' out a lot\nNot talkin' 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things\nDo you want children? Do you wanna marry me?\nDo you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?\nI've got things to do, like nothing at all\nI wanna do them with you\nDo you wanna do them with me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want someone, then just call me up\nAnd remember where I'll be\nSweet in barefeet\nYou can find me where no one will be\nIn the woods somewhere, in the night\nIn the heart of a valley\nIn the sweet north country\nIf I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee"
