  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou were riding your bike to the sound of \"It's No Big Deal\"\nAnd you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels\nNothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now\nSo you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal\n[Chorus]\nYou can let it go\nYou can throw a party full of everyone you know\nAnd not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love\nYou don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm\n[Verse 2]\nMatilda\n, you talk of the pain like it's all alright\nBut I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе\nYou showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days\nIt's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind\n[Chorus]\nYou can let it go\nYou can throw a party full of everyone you know\nAnd not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love\nYou don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up\nYou can see the world, following the seasons\nAnywhere you go, you don't need a reason\n'Cause they never showed you love\nYou don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own\n\n[Bridge]\nYou're just in time, make your tea and your toast\nYou framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh\nYou don't have to go\nYou don't have to go home\nOh, there's a long way to go\nI don't believe that time will change your mind\nIn other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore\nAs long as you can let them go\n[Chorus]\nYou can let it go\nYou can throw a party full of everyone you know\nYou can start a family who will always show you love\nYou don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own\nYou can let it go\nYou can throw a party full of everyone you know\nYou can start a family who will always show you love\nYou don't have to be sorry, no"
