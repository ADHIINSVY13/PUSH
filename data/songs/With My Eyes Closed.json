  "lyrics": "Say you never send me away\nMakin' me a memory and\nTellin' me to find me a life\nChange, there's nothing changing\nWhat cannot be changed\nAnd you are witness to a silent conversation\nNothin' but the black of night\nNo-one ever takes your place\nGotta let the pantomime\nPlay\nNot to worry, my telepathy\nI bring you into me there's be no seperation\nAnd I tell you\nI will climb inside your world\nAnd all my history\nMust revolve around this girl\nAnd I can see you with my eyes closed\nI can feel you when you're near me\nJust the knowing that you\nHear me, could be\nYou could measure my love\nI can touch you with my hands tied\nIt don't take no extra feeling\nLet your imagination, just run\nYou can measure my love\nAnd they tell you\nThey can stop these tears you cry\nAnd we can ride this storm together\nAnd all the love that lasts forever\nAnd forever, and forever\nCling to the vine and the vine never breaks\nIt's a message from a ship to store\nFor the soul and the sacrifice\nPain\nThere's no fury\nLike a woman scorned\nWe could be victims of a lethal combination\nIt's the hourIt's the sword that hides the stone\nAnd one of us holds the power\nThere to forge our hearts together\nHere forever, and forever"
