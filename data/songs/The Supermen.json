  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen all the world was very young\nAnd mountain magic heavy hung\nThe supermen would walk in file\nGuardians of a loveless isle\nAnd gloomy browed with superfear\nTheir tragic endless lives could heave nor sigh\nIn solemn, perverse serenity\nWondrous beings chained to life\n[Chorus 1]\nStrange games they would play then\nNo death for the perfect men\nLife rolls into one for them\nSo softly a supergod cries\n[Verse 2]\nWhere all were minds in uni-thought\nPowers weird by mystics taught\nNo pain, no joy, no power too great\nColossal strength to grasp a fate\nWhere sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers\nNightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold\nA man would tear his brother's flesh\nA chance to die, to turn to mold\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFar out in the red-sky\nFar out from the sad eyes\nStrange, mad celebration\nSo softly a supergod cries\nFar out in the red-sky\nFar out from the sad eyes\nStrange, mad celebration\nSo softly a supergod dies"
