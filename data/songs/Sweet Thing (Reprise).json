  "lyrics": "The reprise of “Sweet Thing”. The end of the previous song, “Candidate” leads into it. The song completes the medley between “Sweet Thing”, “Candidate”, and itself.\n[Chorus]\nIf you want it, boys, get it here, thing\nFor hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing\n[Outro]\nIs it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?\nDo you think that your face looks the same?\nThen let it be, it's all I ever wanted\nIt's a street with a deal and a taste\nIt's got claws, it's got me, it's got you"
