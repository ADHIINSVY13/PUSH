  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen you want to do something that is new\nAnd it seems really, really hard to do\nYou feel like quitting, you feel you’re through\nWell I have some advice for you\n[Chorus]\nDo not give up, keep on trying\nYou all going to make it (ah yeah) do not give up\nDo not ever quit, try and try and you can do it, do not give up (yeah)\n[Verse 2]\nIf you want to catch a ball, but you are having no luck at all\nThe ball hits your head, it hits your nose\nIt hits your belly, your chin and toes\nWell try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon\nYou will put your hands out in the air\nYou will catch that ball, yes this I swear\n[Chorus]\nDo not give up, keep on going\nYou are on a boat, so keep on rowing\nDo not give up, don’t ever stop\nTry and try and you will come out on top, do not give up\n[Verse 3]\nYou got yourself new roller-skates\nYou put them on and you feel great\nStand up, but then you fall\nDo not think you can skate at all\nYou get back up and then you trip\nYou skip and tip and slip and flip\nWell try and try and try some more\nAnd soon you are skating across the floor\n\n[Chorus]\nDo not give up, keep on moving\nYou are going to get there just keep on grooving\nDo not give up, do not pack it in\nTry and try and you will win, do not give up\nNo no no, do not give up\nNo no no, do not give up\nNo no no, do not give up, no no\nDo not give up"
