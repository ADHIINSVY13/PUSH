Nightmare or dream?\nSo disorienting, who knows what they mean?\nDream or nightmare? Nightmare or dream?\nIn one we slumber, in one we scream!\n[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo]\nOnce I had this crazy dream I was a huge rock star\nMy biggest psycho fan was trapped inside my guitar\nIt was a little monster who kept banging on a drum\nThe worst part was it tried to bite my hand each time I strummed\n[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo]\nWait a minute, how could all of this be true?\nThere goes my dog doing something very bad\nOh my gosh, he's walking my dad!\n\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]\nDream or nightmare? Nightmare or dream?\nSo disorienting, who knows what they mean?\nDream or nightmare? Nightmare or dream?\nIn one we slumber, in one we scream!"
