Bang! Bang! You're so mean\nDon't we look good? Don't we look good?\nSwing, swing, guillotine queen\nCut me back down to size\nBang! Bang! Bang! Know what I mean?\nDon't we look good? Don't we look good?\nCloudspotter\n\n[Verse 2]\nHead ringin' in the dead of night\nJust a pair of lovesick parasites\nPut me on hold, hold on tight\nEverything's wrong when you've got no right\nCloudspotter (cloudspotter)\nCloudspotter (cloudspotter)\nEverything's wrong when you've got no right\nCloudspotter, cloudspotter\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI need to know, but I don't ask why\nRefuse me while I kiss the sky\n[Chorus]\nSwing, swing, guillotine queen\nSwingin' from the left to the right\nBang! Bang! Bang! You're so mean\nDon't we look good? Don't we look good?\nSwing, swing, guillotine queen\nCut me back down to size\nBang! Bang! Bang! Know what I mean?\nDon't we look good? Don't we look good?\nCloudspotter\nCloudspotter!\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI need to know, but I don't ask why\nRefuse me while I kiss the sky!\n[Chorus]\nSwing, swing, guillotine queen\nSwingin' from the left to the right\nBang! Bang! Bang! You're so mean\nDon't we look good? Don't we look good?\nSwing, swing, guillotine queen\nCut me back down to size\nBang! Bang! Bang! Know what I mean?\nDon't we look good? Don't we look good?\nCloudspotter\nCloudspotter!"
