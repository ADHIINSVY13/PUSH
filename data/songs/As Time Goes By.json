  "lyrics": "You must remember this\nA kiss is still a kiss\nA sigh is just a sigh\nThe fundamental things apply\nAs time goes by\nAnd when two lovers woo\nThey still say \"I love you\"\nOn that you can rely\nNo matter what the future brings\nAs time goes by\nMoonlight and love songs never out of date\nHearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate\nWoman needs man and man must have his mate\nThat no one can deny\nIt's still the same old story\nA fight for love and glory\nA case of do or die\nThe world will always welcome lovers\nAs time goes by"
