  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat does it matter, if rain comes your way?\nAnd raindrops patter all day\nThe rain descending should not make you blue\nThe happy ending is waiting for you\n[Chorus]\nTake your share of trouble, face it and don't complain\nIf you want the rainbow, you must have the rain\nHappiness comes double after a little pain\nIf you want the rainbow, you must have the rain\n[Verse 2]\nWhat if your love affair should break up\nAs they sometimes will\nWhen you kiss and make up\nOoh, oh boy what a thrill!\n[Refrain]\nSadness ends in gladness, showers are not in vain\nIf you want the rainbow, you must have the rain\n[Chorus]\nTake your share of trouble, face it and don't complain\nIf you want the rainbow, you must have the rain\nHappiness comes double after a little pain\nIf you want the rainbow, you must have the rain\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat if your love affair should break up\nAs they sometimes will\nWhen you kiss and make up\nOoh, what a thrill!\n[Refrain]\nSadness ends in gladness, showers are not in vain\nIf you want the rainbow, you must have the rain"
