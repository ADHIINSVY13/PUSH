  "lyrics": "This is an unreleased song from 2017, a ballad with a simple piano accompaniment, with a Country and Weston flavour.\nI'm not going your way\nBut I don't want to take a leap of faith\nWe come from a different place\nAnd the road ahead makes me so afraid\nWhen you disappear from view\nI don't know what I will do\nI'm never gonna look behind me\nYou could find me if you wanted to\nI've never been so dislocated\nHow I hated that I had to choose\nCome to me\nCome to me\nI'm not going your way\nI guess I lost a friend at the journey's end\nThis is the price you pay\nFor giving your heart to a new cliche\nWhen you disappear from viеw\nI don't know what I will do\nI'm never gonna look behind mе\nYou could find me if you wanted to\nI've never been so dislocated\nHow I hated that I had to choose\nCome to me\nCome to me\n\nCome to me\nCome to me\nYeah\nWhen you disappear from view\nI don't know what I will do\nI'm not going your way\nI'm not going your way"
