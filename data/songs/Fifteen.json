  "lyrics": "In “Fifteen,” Taylor looks back at her freshman year at Hendersonville High. Taylor wrote the song about her best friend, Abigail Anderson, who she met during ninth grade and is still best friends with.\n[Verse 1]\nYou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\nIt's the mornin' of your very first day\nYou say \"hi\" to your friends you ain't seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\n\"You know, I haven't seen you around before\"\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nFifteen\n[Verse 2]\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough, you're best friends\nLaughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be outta here as soon as we can\nAnd then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feelin' like flyin'\nAnd your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin 'round\nBut in your life, you'll do things greater than\nDating the boy on the football team\nBut I didn't know it at fifteen\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nI've found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to be\nAt fifteen\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\n[Outro]\nYour very first day\nTake a deep breath, girl\nTake a deep breath as you walk through the doors"
