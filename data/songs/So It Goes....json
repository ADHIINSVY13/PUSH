(One, two, three)\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd all the pieces fall (Pieces fall) right into place\nGettin' caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up), lipstick on your face\nSo it goes\nI'm yours to keep (Oh) and I'm yours to lose (Baby)\nYou know I'm not a bad girl, but I (I do) do bad things with you\nSo it goes\n[Refrain]\nCome here, dressed in black now\nSo, so, so it goes\nScratches down your back now\nSo, so, so it goes\nCome here, dressed in black now\nSo, so, so it goes\nScratches down your back now\nSo, so, so it goes"
