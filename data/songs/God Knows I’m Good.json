  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was walking through the counters of a national concern\nAnd a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder\nAnd I saw the multitude of faces: honest, rich and clean\nAs the merchandise exchanged and money roared\nAnd a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak\nInto the paper bag at her side\nAnd her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed\nSo she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind...\n[Chorus]\nCrying: \"God knows I'm good!\"\n\"God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good!\"\nGod may look the other way today\n\"God knows I'm good!\"\n\"God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good!\"\nGod may look the other way today\n[Verse 2]\nThen she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag\nPerspiration trickled down her forehead\nAnd her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder\nShe was led away bewildered and amazed\nThrough her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter\nAs her escort asked her softly for her name\nAnd a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady\nWho had fainted to the whirling wooden floor...\n\n[Chorus]\nCrying: \"God knows I'm good!\"\n\"God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good!\"\nSurely, God won't look the other way\n\"God knows I'm good!\"\n\"God knows I'm good, God knows I'm good!\"\nSurely, God won't look the other way\nHey!"
