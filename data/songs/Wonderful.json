'Cause I am\nWonderful, 'cause I am\n[Verse 2]\nI wrote a song about your eyes\nAte a slice of cherry pie\nI cried all night\nOn a bench inside the park\nI'll kiss you slowly in the dark\nI'll never stop\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI really can't believe I lost myself again\n[Chorus]\nLooking for something crazy\nBeautiful love\nAnd now I'm talking in circles again\nHave my love, baby\nAre you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am\nWonderful, 'cause I am\n[Bridge]\nBaby, take me for a ride\nMaybe get a little high in a place we have never been\nTime is nothing but a line\nWe leave everything behind\nIt'd be so wonderful, wonderful\n[Chorus]\nLooking for something crazy\nBeautiful love\nAnd now I'm talking in circles again\nHave my love, baby\nAre you hungry for wonderful? 'Cause I am\nWonderful, 'cause I am\n\n[Outro]\n(\nLooking for something crazy\n)\nWonderful I am (\nbeautiful nothing, now\n)\nI am, I am (\nI'm talking in circles again\n)\nIt's killing me, boy, yeah\nI am, I am\nYou'll know how wonderful I am\nWonderful I am\nWonderful I"
