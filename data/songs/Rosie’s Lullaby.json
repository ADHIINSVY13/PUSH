  "lyrics": "She walked by the ocean\nAnd waited for a star\nTo carry her away\nFeelin' so small\nAt the bottom of the world\nLookin' up to God\nTries to take deep breaths\nTo smell the salty sea\nAs it moves over her feet\nThe water pulls so strong\nAnd no one is around\nAnd the moon is looking down\nSayin', \"Rosie, come with me\nClose your eyes and dream\"\nThe big ships are rollin'\nAnd lighting up the night\nAnd she calls out, but they just her pass by\nThe waves are crashin'\nBut not making a sound\nJust mouthing along\n\nSayin', \"Rosie, come with me\nClose your eyes and dream\"\nClose your eyes and dream\nClose your eyes and dream"
