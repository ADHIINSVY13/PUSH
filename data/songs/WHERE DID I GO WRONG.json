Is there someone out there?\nTake me by my heart, self-destructions I'm in\nYuh, yuh\n[Verse: Pouya]\nI been singing the same songs, I'm running in place, I got nowhere to go\nNothing to show, couple bad sold out shows when I look in the room\nBaby Bone got flows, galorе, more money, more prеssure\nI endure, baby, you were the one that I kill for\nNow I'm so lonely, I'm mentally frozen\nCan't break what's already broken\nMy heart has been stolen, seems to be my slogan\nAnd I'm losing my focus\nLosing myself as I fade away, nothing you say is saving me\nMy grip, my grasp, been so stuck in the past\nBitch, you don't know how longer will let\nI'm on my last breath, I can bet, yuh\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rocci]\nWhere did I go wrong? Is there someone out there?\nTake me by my heart, self-destructions I'm in\n[Chorus: Rocci]\nWhere did I go wrong? Is there someone out there?\nTake me by my heart, self-destructions I'm in\n[Outro: \nPouya\n]\nI don't wanna play the blame game\nYou can put it all on me, I'm defeated\nMy heart is no longer beating\nI don't wanna play the blame game\nYou can put it all on me, I'm defeated\nMy heart is no longer beating\nI don't wanna play the blame game\nYou can put it all on me, I'm defeated\nMy heart is no longer beating\nI don't wanna play the blame game\nYou can put it all on me, I'm defeated\nMy heart is no longer beating"
