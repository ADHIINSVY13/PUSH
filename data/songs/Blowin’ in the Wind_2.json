Yeah\nHow many years can a man exist before he's allowed to be free? Yeah\nNow, how many times can a man turn his head and he pretends that he just doesn't see?\nWhoa, yeah\n[Chorus]\nYou know the answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind\nUh-huh\n[Outro]\nUh-huh\nAnd let me tell you it's blowin' (Blowin')\nBlowin' (Blowin')\nAnd it's blowin'\nOh, the answer is blowin' in the wind\nAnd it's blowin', yeah yeah yeah\nThe answer is blowin' in the wind"
