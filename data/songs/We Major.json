Now, nigga, that's a chaser\nTurn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior\nBest things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper\nHigh off the ground, from stair to skyscraper\nCool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major\n[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]\nWe major? C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major? C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major! C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major! C'mon\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nFeeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon\nBetter than a chick that say \"Yes\" too soon\nUntil you have a daughter; that's what I call karma\nAnd you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon\nProjects tore up, gang signs is thrown up\nNiggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up\nWhy else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?\nGet they first car and then, IRS show up\nHe ain't never had shit, but he had that nine\nNigga come through flicking and he had that shine\nPut two and two together and a little bad weather\nGon' be your whole family on that funeral line\nAsked the reverend, \"Was the strip clubs cool?\nIf my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?\"\nThat's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey\nI ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me\n\n[Chorus: Really Doe]\nYou motherfuckers better do your job and roll up\nAnd watch how we roll up, and\nI can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts\nI take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck\nI take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck\nBut really, what's amazing is how I keep blazing\nTowel under the door, we smoke until the day's end\nPuff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation\nHpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser\nTurn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior\nBest things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper\nHigh off the ground, from stair to skyscraper\nCool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major\n[Post-Chorus: Nas]\nWe major? C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major? C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major! C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major! C'mon, homie, we major\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nI heard the beat and I ain't know what to write\nFirst line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?\nFour-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice\nRap about big paper or the black man plight\nAt the studio console, asked my man to the right\n\"What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?\nHe said, \"Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still\"\nLooked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel\nBeen like twelve years since a nigga first signed\nNow, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time\nTo build my very own Motown\n'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives\nAnd it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life\nAnd I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic\nSo y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt\nI'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed\nI survived the livest niggas around\nLasted longer than more than half of you clowns\nLook, I used to cook before I had the game took\nEither way, my change came like Sam Cooke\n\n[Refrain: Tony Williams & \nNas\n]\nBah-dah-bah-bah (\nYeah, yeah,\n yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah\n)\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today\nLike better late than never; it's orientation\nStill, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!\n[Chorus: Really Doe & \nTony Williams\n]\nYou motherfuckers better do your job and roll up\nAnd watch how we roll up, and (\nBah-dah-bah-bah\n)\nI can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts\nI take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck\nI take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck\nBut really what's amazing is how I keep blazing\nTowel under the door, we smoke until the day's end\nPuff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation\nHpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!\n)\nTurn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (\nBah-dah-bah-bah\n)\nBest things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper\nHigh off the ground, from stair to skyscraper\nCool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major\n[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & \nNas\n]\nWe major? (\nC'mon, homie, we major\n)\nWe major? (\nC'mon, homie, we major\n)\nWe major! (\nC'mon, homie, we major\n)\nWe major!\n\n[Refrain: Tony Williams]\nOh, oh, oh, ooh! Bah-dah-bah-bah\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today\nBut better late than never; it's orientation\nStill, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away!\n[Interlude: Kanye West & \nTony Williams\n]\nCan I talk my shit again?\nCan I talk my shit again?\nI can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker\nI'ma be late, though\nI gotta figure out what I'm finna wear\nYeah\nThe Roc is definitely in the building\nG.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh\nI gotta say \"What's up\" to Tony Williams\nOn the vocals!\nSings—He sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?\nDon't you agree?\nUgh\nAnd Jon Brion on the keys right now\nAnd Warryn Campbell on the keys right now\nSo they asked me:\n\"Why you call it \nLate Registration\n, 'Ye?\"\n'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school\nLa, la, la, la-la-la-la la\nIf you know this part right here, feel free to sing along\nLa la la la la, la-la-la\n[Refrain: Tony Williams & \nKanye West\n]\nBah-dah-bah-bah (\nOh\n)\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today (\nIf you feeling good\n)\nBut better late than never; it's orientation (\nIt's orientation\n)\nBut we can make it better, throwing all your cares away\n[Outro]\nWe want you \nto get used to this\nOh, oh, oh, ooh! Bah-dah-bah-bah\nUgh, they can't do what we do, baby\nUh-uh, uh-uh! \nThey\n can't do what we do, baby\nUh-uh, uh-uh! They can't\n do what we do, baby\nYeah\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!"
