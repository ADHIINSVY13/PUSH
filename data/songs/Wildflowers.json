  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIvy vines that clothe the tree, daisies look and take a peak\nSun takes colours from the green and bleaches\nDecember white, a cotton dress, open lawn to make a nest\nTry to think what I love best in your features\n[Chorus]\nYou were born to run and run till you find your fire\nI saw what you'd become, I know, I know\nBlossoming among the wildflowers, flowers\n[Verse 2]\nDaggers wide, they cut through skin, a new addition to your grin\nTo reach the end, we must begin to feel it\nLie and trace you on the grass, hair that makеs a question mark\nYou'll always be in my heart, I mеan it\n[Chorus]\nYou were born to run and run till you find your fire\nI saw what you'd become, I know, I know\nBlossoming among the wildflowers, flowers\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Chorus]\nYou were born to run and run till you find your fire\nI saw what you'd become, I know, I know\nBlossoming among the wildflowers, flowers"
