  "lyrics": "A silent night, a lonely night\nI didn't mean to wake you up I was leaving anyway\nWe never asked each other why\nWe only made each other cry\nWhen the day becomes the night\nAnd all that I have left inside is scattered on the wind\nDidn't I give you all that love could bring\nDidn't I give you more than everything\nYou know it hurts to end like this, when we've come so far\nDon't tell me love is blind\nCause I know what I see\nTell me how you walk away when all you know is me\nAnd all that might have been\nAnd what we left behind\nDon't ever let a living person tell you love is blind\nMemories of summer days\nLaughing like a little child lying in you arms\nAnd we would own the stars like days of old\nWe'd make a vow to have and hold\nNow we see the empty stage\nThe actors gone the empty page\nThe tears between the lines\n\nSave me from these wild imaginings\nTry to stop my heart remembering\nActing like there's someone else when there's only me\nSo tell me what to say\nTell me what to do\nTell me how to walk away when all I see is you\nShadows on the wall\nPictures in your mind\nNever let a living person tell you love is blind"
