My God, you're divine\nGimme them, gimme them dope and diamonds\n\n[Chorus]\nDiet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City\nNever was there ever a girl so pretty\nDo you think we'll be in love forever?\nDo you think we'll be in love?\nDiet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City\nCan we hit it now, low-down and gritty?\nDo you think we'll be in love forever?\nDo you think we'll be in love?\n[Bridge]\nYou're no good for me\nBaby, you're no good for me\nYou're no good for me\nBut baby, I want you, I want you\nYou're no good for me\nBaby, you're no good for me\nYou're no good for me\nBut baby, I want you, I want you, I want you\n[Chorus]\nDiet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City\nNever was there ever a girl so pretty\nDo you think we'll be in love forever?\nDo you think we'll be in love?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBaby stoppin' at 7-Eleven\nThere in his white Pontiac Heaven\nDo you think we'll be in love forever?\nDo you think we'll be in love?\n[Chorus]\nDiet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City\nCan we hit it now, low-down and gritty?\nDo you think we'll be in love forever?\nDo you think we'll be in love?\nDiet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City\nNever was there ever a girl so pretty\nDo you think we'll be in love forever?\nDo you think we'll be in love?"
