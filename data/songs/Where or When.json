  "lyrics": "When you're awake the things you think\nCome from the dream you dream\nThought has wings, and lots of things\nAre seldom what they seem\nSometimes you think you've lived before\nAll that you live today\nThings you do come back to you\nAs though they knew the way\nOh the tricks your mind can play\nIt seems we stood and talked like this, before\nWe looked at each other in the same way then\nBut I can't remember where or when\nThe clothes you are wearing are the clothes you wore\nThe smile you are smiling you were smiling then\nBut I can't remember where or when\nSome things that happened for the first time\nSeem to be happening again\nAnd so it seems that we have met before\nAnd laughed before, and loved before\nBut who knows where or when"
