  "lyrics": "With virtually identical lyrics to ‘Hyper Music’, but devoid of the searing guitar presence, this song paints a much more melancholiac reflection on days gone by.\n[Verse 1]\nGolden lies feed my role\nThis forgotten space race under my control\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho's returned from the dead?\nWho remains?\n[Verse 2]\nYou wanted more than I was worth\nYou think I was scared, yeah, and you needed proof\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho really cares anymore?\nWho restrains?\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nWell, I don't love you\nAnd I never did\nI don't love you\nAnd I never will"
