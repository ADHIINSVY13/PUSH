  "lyrics": "This song is about a stagnant relationship. It’s featured on Muse’s Newton Abbot Demo. A short snippet of the song recorded at Budstock 1997 surfaced in 2005.\n[Verse 1]\nWe should be in the summer spirit\nBut it might as well be rain\nWe should be having such a good time\nBut I'm so bored it's causing me pain\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy dear\nThis love is dead\nSomehow, someway\nYou'll come away\nWith you it's dead\n[Chorus]\nI can't let you pretend\nThese days\n(These days)\nAre the best you've had\nDoesn't matter cause I love you\n[Verse 2]\nStop telling me to try and cheer up\nI just don't wanna be here\nWe should be having such a good time\nBut you're no good\nNo, you are going blind\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy dear\nThis love is dead\nThere's no way\nYou'll come away\nWith you it's dead\n[Chorus]\nI can't let you pretend\nThese days\n(These days)\nAre the best you've had\n[Outro]\nMy dear, this love is dead\nSomehow, someway\nYou'll come away"
