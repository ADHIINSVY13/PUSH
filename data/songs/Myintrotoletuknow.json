You bite, you fucked up\nYou won't be gettin' away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up?\nI rip shit with pimp shit, I'm slingin' it from the South\nTalk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fuckin' mouth\nFuckin' true that, so true that\nSmoke one, yeah\n\n[Chorus: André 3000]\nIf you smoke a dime, yeah (Like that for the A-Town)\nSay I'll smoke a dime (This is my intro, just to let you know)\nIf you smoke a dime (Yeah, yeah, like that)\nSay I'll smoke a dime (Yeah)"
