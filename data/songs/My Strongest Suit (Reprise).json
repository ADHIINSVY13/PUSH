  "lyrics": "[AMNERIS]\nI may leave a great impression\nAs I race through a succession\nOf the latest crazes, chase the newest fad\nI feel better when beguiling\nFind that fashion keeps me smiling\nBut in my heart I know it's rather sad\n[AIDA]\nThat a life of great potential\nIs dismissed, inconsequential\n[AMNERIS]\nAnd only ever seen as being cute\nSo I'll flutter to deceive\n[AIDA]\nOh no you must believe\nThat one day you're bound to find\n[BOTH]\nA stronger suit"
