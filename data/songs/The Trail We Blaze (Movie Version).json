  "lyrics": "Tulio, Miguel, and Altivo travel through the island, hoping to find El Dorado\nLook out new world here we come\nBrave, intrepid, and then some\nPioneers of maximum audacity whose résumés\nShow that we are just the team\nTo live where others merely dream\nBuilding up a head of steam\nOn the trail we blaze\nChanging legend into fact\nWe shall ride into history\nTurning myth into truth\nWe shall surely gaze\nOn the sweet unfolding\nOf an antique mystery\nAll will be revealed\nOn the trail we blaze\nParadise is close at hand\nShangri-La\nThe Promised Land\nSeventh Heaven on demand\nQuite unusual nowadays\nVirgin vistas undefiled\nMinds and bodies running wild\nIn the man, behold the child\nOn the trail we blaze\n\nThe trail we blaze\nIs a road uncharted\nThrough \nterra incognita\n to a golden shrine\nNo place for the traveller to be faint-hearted\nWe are part of the sumptuous grand design\nChanging legend into fact\nWe shall ride into history\nTurning myth into truth\nWe shall surely gaze\nOn the sweet unfolding\nOf an antique mystery\nAll will be revealed\nOn the trail we blaze"
