My name is—you know what my name is\nBitch, I'm famous, like Tom Brady\nAnd hi—your name is? Not important\nWho cares? Not Weezy Baby, ugh\n[Verse 1]\nWake up, I see \"bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch\"\nUgh, makeup on my pillows make me mad, bitch\nWithout no makeup, I see that bitch as just average\nUgh, Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi\nLooking at my Rollie, I got boogers on my Rollie\n'Bout to hook up with my whoadie\nGot the hook-up on that codeine\nGot the sugar for your nose ring\nGot the blooka, I'm reloading\nAnd according to my darling, this dick feels so damn rewarding\nI'm reporting out of shorty, she so naughty, me so horny\nKilo on me like I'm Tony, break it down to Rice-A-Roni\nTake her out, look like she lonely\nI'm gon' candlelight the moment\nI'ma vandalize the pussy\nShe told him \"My phone was roaming,\" ugh\nShe be moaning 'til the morning, I be goin' in\nI be on it, I be in it, I'm like Foreman on the grill\nAnd I got doormen at the entrance\nThey got pistols in they trenches\nThey got rituals, religion\nAnd I'm like, \"Bitch, you know I'm sipping 'til I die\"\n\n[Chorus]\nMy name is Lil Wayne, bitch\nWeezy F. Baby, ha\nHer name went from whatever-it-was\nTo \"Lil Wayne' bitch\"\n—now, that's crazy\nAnd I, I camed in, regained strength\nRe-banged it, rotation\nHer guy? He's nameless, he ain't shit\nAlways on the same shit—poor baby\n[Verse 2]\nI pour up so much, they call me \"Pour Baby\"\nKush man, I need a sack like Charles Haley\nSipping to the Big Moe, I'm the Barre Baby\nSip got me moving slow, but my thoughts racing, \nerr\n!\nMy long days give me short patience\nMy heart vacant, awards taken\nWhat in tarnation? No information, no statements\nYoung Mula, old moolah, moolah all ages\nHa-Hallelujah, I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac\nRoc-A-Fella, new rock, hundred K in a shoebox\nAK and a new Glock go, \"Wop-bap-ba-loo-bop\"\nPray the vest you got save you like a coupon\nHustle 'til my dreadlock is grey as some Poupon\nEvery day is my birthday: I'm a newborn\nStay on my toes, ask a shoehorn\nI ain't got no roof on, gettin' my \nNo Ceilings 2\n on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd hi, I'm brainless\n, I'm stainless\nEntertainment: His lady\nAnd, um, if she ain't thick, then she ain't it\nI can't fuck with a slim lady\nI tried, but Superhead keep complaining\nBitch ancient, bitch shady, and she tired\nOkay, then—I'm skatin'\nDoing tricks—call me \"'Trick Swayze\"\n[Verse 3]\nOkay, In other news and other niggas' hoes\nYour wife taste like Honey Nut Cheerios\nI'm in the mirror, like \"Ooh, baby\"\nWho needs a miracle when I got you, baby?\nPimpin' in my last life; I'm the shit, you ass-wipe\nBeat the pussy, cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight\nWeed is like a airline, 'cause easily, I'm that high\nFistful of money: Mix some green in with your black eye\nGreedy like a fat guy, I'll eat a nigga franchise\nI beat him by a landslide, a leader like a rabbi\nI'm leading by halftime; he bleeding, I'm a vampire\nHis body in the trunk with his feet all on my Alpines\nWe the niggas—that's right, we all that and fries\nY'all on standby, my broads got cat eyes\nTraphouse landlines, boom like landmines\nAll my bitches allies with \"Tune\" on they backside\n\n[Chorus]\nSo hi, my name is on her anus\nOn her cranium, bitch cravin'\nAnd I'm fly, and I'm wavy, and her name is Bust-It-Baby\nAnd hi, my name is in your mouth, it must be tasty—gone!"
