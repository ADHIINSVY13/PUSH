  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nRain\nHe wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride, I was making my own name\nChasing that fame, he stayed the same\nAll of me changed like midnight\n[Verse 1]\nMy town was a wasteland\nFull of cages, full of fences\nPageant queens and big pretenders\nBut for some, it was paradise\nMy boy was a montage\nA slow-motion, love potion\nJumping off things in the ocean\nI broke his heart 'cause he was nice\nHe was sunshine, I was midnight rain\n[Chorus]\nHe wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride, I was making my own name\nChasing that fame, he stayed the same\nAll of me changed like midnight\n[Verse 2]\nIt came like a postcard\nPicture perfect shiny family\nHoliday peppermint candy\nBut for him, it's every day\nSo I peered through a window\nA deep portal, time travel\nAll the love we unravel\nAnd the life I gave away\n'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain\n\n[Chorus]\nHe wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride, I was making my own name\nChasing that fame, he stayed the same\nAll of me changed like midnight rain\nHe wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\nHe wanted a bride, I was making my own name\nChasing that fame, he stayed the same\nAll of me changed like midnight\n[Outro]\nI guess sometimes we all get\nJust what we wanted, just what we wanted\nAnd he never thinks of me\nExcept for when I'm on TV\nI guess sometimes we all get\nSome kind of haunted, some kind of haunted\nAnd I never think of him\nExcept on midnights like this\n(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"
