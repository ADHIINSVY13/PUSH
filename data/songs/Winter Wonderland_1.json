  "lyrics": "Sleigh bells ring\nAre you listening?\nIn the lane\nSnow is glistening\nA beautiful sight\nWe're happy tonight\nWalking\nIn a winter wonderland\nGone away\nIs the bluebird\nHere to stay\nIs a new bird\nHe sings a love song\nAs we go along\nWalking\nIn a winter wonderland\nIn the meadow\nWe can build a snowman\nAnd pretend\nThat he is Parson Brown\nHe'll say are you married?\nWe'll say No man\nBut you can do the job\nWhen you're in town\n\nLater on, we'll conspire\nAs we dream, by the fire\nTo face unafraid\nThe plans that we've made\nWalking\nIn a winter wonderland\nIn the meadow\nWe can build a snowman\nAnd pretend\nThat he's a circus clown\nWe'll have lots of fun\nWith Mr. Snowman\nUntil the other kids\nCome knock him down\nWhen it's cold\nAin't it thrilling\nWhen your nose\nGets to chilling\nWe'll frolic and play\nThe eskimo way\nWalking\nIn a winter wonderland\nWalking\nIn a winter wonderland"
