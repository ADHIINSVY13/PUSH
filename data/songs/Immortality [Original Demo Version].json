  "lyrics": "So this is who I am\nAnd this is all I know\nAnd I must choose to live\nFor all that I can give\nThe spark that makes the power grow\nBut I will stand for one dream if I can\nSymbol of my faith in who I am\nBut you are my only\nAnd I must follow on the road that lies ahead\nI won't let my heart control my head\nBut you are my only\nAnd we don't say goodbye\nWe don't say goodbye\nAnd I know what I've got to be...\nImmortality\nI make my journey through eternity\nI keep the memory of you and me\nInside\nFulfill your destiny\nIt's there within the child\nMy storm will never end\nMy fate is on the wind\nThe King of Hearts\nThe Joker's wild\n\nWe don't say goodbye\nWe don't say goodbye\nI'll make them all remember me\nCause I have found the dream that must come true\nEvery ounce of me must see it through\nBut you are my only\nI'm sorry I don't have the role for love to play\nHand over my heart I'll find my way\nI will make them give to me...\nImmortality\nThere is a vision and a fire in me\nI keep the memory of you and me\nInside\nAnd we don't say goodbye\nWe don't say goodbye\nIn all my love for you\nAnd what else we may do\nWe don't say goodbye..."
