Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane\nIn search of fame, won't hurt to change\nFollowing the foot steps of past dealers\nEquipped with Ski masks, no witnesses, we blast squealers\nAnd now they feel us in this act of war, more casualties, no survivors\nAny man that defy us, quickly dies 'cause we riders\nIn my quest for chips\nWe wear vests, equipped with automatic fire we reply when my enemies trip\nMe and you against the nation, whispering while we conversatin'\n'Cause niggas died over information\nHow much more can we take, expect us all to wait\nThe world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay\nThey never wanted us to make it\nEverything that we possess, we had to fight and take it\nI think the President is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat\nMakin' a livin' out of my misery\n 'til he got a friend like me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\n[Verse 3]\nPromise to visit, I know it's rough in your cell\nReceiving mail to the county jail, this is hell\nWhen I was younger I could picture livin'\nIn luxury\nSo how the fuck did I end up in prison\nFuckin' snitches, they got me crossed by my own side\nI found him by his self, no drama, he alone die\nNobody cry, should have never testified\nYou got my nigga 25, so now I sacrifice your life\nHelp to separate me and my dog\nBroken ties, why the fuck should I let you live when I'm dead inside?\nRapid fire my delivery\nI'm bustin' at they whole crew nigga, remember me\nHit up my Outlawz set then throw my pistol in the ocean\nDitch my ski mask and get to straight coastin'\nIt's visitin' day at San Quentin, always there to see your closest roaddog\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\n[Small Hook]\nCome after us, best be complete\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nCome after us, best be complete\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\n[Outro]\nRight! You ain't ever had a friend like me\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nYou ain't ever had a friend like me\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me"
