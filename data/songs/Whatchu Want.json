Whatchu-whatchu want, nigga?\n[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nI'm sticking ice picks on the tip of ya dick\nGive your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?\nAm I hard hardcore? Harder than the Plymouth\nIt ain't no myth, it's a nigga with a spliff and\nA chrome four fifth, pressed on ya back\nSo what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?\nI hope civilized, 'cause I love to see niggas die\nBrains all leaking out on the street\nAnd the pastor preaching, \"He was a good man!\"\nPlayed the bad man when the burner was in his hand\nNow he's singing sad songs with Elvis\nThree to the head, 'bout six cross the pelvis\nYou fuck with the high guy, ya die\nYou're the same motherfucker kickin' \"Look up in the sky!\"\nI'm on some ole next shit, suplex shit, hardcore sex shit\nAnd TEC shit – whatchu want, nigga?!\n[Hook: Puff Daddy, The Notorious B.I.G, talking]\nWhatchu want, nigga?

Whatchu-whatchu want, nigga?\n\n[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nFuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga (Yeah)\nWhen I get busy, throw your hands to the sky, nigga\nI got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me\nKnowing that they'd rather be stabbing me\nAll up in my back, trying to take my track (Fuck that!)\nWhen I used to sell crack, I ain't have problems like that\nStreet rules – watch your pockets and your jewels\nA nigga front, throw the gat to the fools\nTears don't effect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G\nDisrespect me? My potency is deadly\nOnce the venom hits the cerebellum\nMy lips get chapped and my hands start swellin' (Yeah yeah yeah)\nKeep the nine millimeter by the Peter\nTo kill a motherfucker, don't a thing feel sweeter\nOooohh, it make my head hurt, the blood squirt\nThe robbery expert's berzerk\nWhatchu want, nigga?!\n[Hook: Puff Daddy]\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu-whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu-whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga? Whatchu-whatchu want, nigga?\nWhatchu want, nigga?
