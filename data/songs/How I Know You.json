  "lyrics": "[MEREB]\nI grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow\nI hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow\nEgyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains\nYou witnessed our abduction, which possibly explains\nHow I know you\nHow I know you\nBefore that fateful morning, my family enjoyed\nA privileged existence, for my father was employed\nAs advisor to the King, no less, which surely rings a bell\nFor as you are his daughter, you probably can tell\nHow I know you\nYes, I know you\n[AIDA]\nYou know too much, and what you say is better left unknown\nAnd now I'm just a slave like you, our lives our not our own\n[MEREB]\nI never have abandoned, and nor I think could you\nThat spark of hope for freedom no terror can subdue\n[AIDA]\nMy only hope is silence, you've never seen my face\n\n[MEREB]\nNo, you remain a princess in any time or place\n[AIDA]\nYou don't know me\n[MEREB]\nYes, I know you\n[AIDA]\nYou don't know me\n[MEREB]\nHow I know you\nHow I know you"
