  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was sitting in the classroom\nTrying to look intelligent\nIn case the teacher looked at me\nShe was long and she was lean\nShe's a middle-aged dream\nAnd that lady means the whole world to me\n[Verse 2]\nIt's a natural achievement\nConquering my homework\nWith her image pounding in my brain\nShe's an inspiration\nFor my graduation\nAnd she helps to keep the classroom sane\n[Chorus]\nOh, teacher, I need you like a little child\nYou got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild\nYou give me education in the lovesick blues\nHelp me get straight, come out and say\nTeacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you\n[Verse 3]\nI have to write a letter, ooh\nTell about my feelings\nJust to let her know the scene\nFocus my attention\nOn some further education\nIn connection with the birdies and the bees\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh, so I'm sitting in the classroom, woo!\nI'm looking like a zombie\nI'm waiting for the bell to ring\nI've got John Wayne stances\nI've got Errol Flynn advances\nAnd it doesn't mean a doggoned thing\n[Chorus]\nOh, teacher, I need you like a little child\nYou got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild\nYou give me education in the lovesick blues\nHelp me get straight, come out and say\nTeacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you\nOh teacher, I need you like a little child\nYou got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild\nYou give me education in the lovesick blues\nHelp me get straight, come out and say\nTeacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you"
