(La La Na Na)\nNow I'm getting older\nAm I getting over you? (La La Na Na)\nNow I'm getting older\nAm I getting over you?\nI guess you’ll never know, oh\n[Verse 2: Harry Styles]\nOh, I Know he’s got the money\nBaby honey does he make your night?\nIs it true he doesn’t touch you in the place the way I know you like\nAnd I swear that I’m not thinking about you all the time\nJust today, yesterday, every day, and tomorrow night\n[Chorus: Harry Styles]\nNow I'm getting older\nAm I getting over you? (La La Na Na)\nNow I'm getting older\nAm I getting over you? (La La Na Na)\nNow I'm getting older\nAm I getting over you?\nI guess you’ll never know, ow\n\n[Outro: Harry Styles]\nI swear I'm not thinking about you now\n(Over, over, over, over)\nI swear I'm not thinking about you now\n(Over, over, over, over)\nNow I'm getting older\nAm I getting over you?\nI guess we’ll never know, aye!\nHa!"
