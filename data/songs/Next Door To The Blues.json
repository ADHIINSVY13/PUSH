  "lyrics": "Sorrow\nIs the street that I'm living on\nAcross Pain Avenue\nIn a town call Moan\nThe people I see are sadder than me\nA river of tears\nDon't you know it flows by my door\nAnd I'm living\n(Next door to the Blues)\nYes I'm living\n(Next door to the Blues)\nAnd after all I've been through\nI've had to move\nOh Lord\nNext door to the Blues\nMemory\nYou can tell it in my talk\nMy heart hurts\nEven when I walk\nI cry on\nA pillar made of stone\nPity is my name\nAnd that thing called love is to blame\n\nAnd I'm living\n(Next door to the Blues)\nYes I'm living\n(Next door to the Blues)\nAnd after all I've been through\nI've had to move, oh Lord\nNext door to the Blues\nBittersweet\nIs the food that I cook\nMy only joy is in a storybook\nThe talk I give\nEvery word brings a tear\nEvery hello\nJust ends with a sad goodbye\nAnd I'm living\n(Next door to the Blues)\nYes I'm living\n(Next door to the Blues)\nAnd after all I've been through\nI've had to move, Oh Lord\nNext door to the Blues"
