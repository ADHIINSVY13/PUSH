  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder\nWatchin' your husband swing in time\nI guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute\nIt was Woodstock in my mind\nIn the next mornin', they put out the warnin'\nTensions were risin' over country lines\nI turned off the music, tried to sit and use it\nAll of the love that I saw that night\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause what about all these children\nAnd what about all their parents?\nAnd what about all their crowns they wear\nIn hair so long like mine?\nAnd what about all their wishes\nWrapped up like garland roses\nAround their little heads?\nI said a prayer for a third time\n[Chorus]\nI'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)\nI'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)\nI'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway)\nI'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question\nI'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder\nWatchin' your husband swing and shine\nI'd say he was hella cool to win them over\nCritics can be so mean sometimes\nHe was on his knees and I thought he was breakin' 'em down\nWith his words and his voice divine\nDoesn't take a genius to know what you've got goin'\nAnd to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat about all these children\nAnd all their children's children?\nAnd why am I even wonderin' that today?\nMaybe my contribution could be as small as hoping\nThat words could turn to birds\nAnd birds would send my thoughts your way\n[Chorus]\nI'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)\nI'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)\nI'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway)\nI'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question\nI'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question\n[Post-Chorus]\nA stairway, stairway to Heaven\n(Na-na, na-na)\nA stairway\n\n[Bridge]\nGot a million things I wanna say\nLike, what's it all for? Will it be okay?\n(A stairway, stairway to Heaven)\nMillion things I wanna say\nLike, what's it all for?\n(A stairway)\n[Outro]\nOoh\nOoh (Stairway, stairway to Heaven)\nOoh (Na-na)\nOoh (Stairway)\nOh (Stairway, stairway to Heaven)\nOh (Stairway)"
