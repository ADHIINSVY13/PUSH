(Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum)\nHaha (Okay, okay) (Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-du)\nY'all don't look too happy to see me (Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum)\nFuck, man (Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-du)\nDon't everybody welcome me back at once (Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum)\nAlright, fuck you all then (Dum, du-du-du-dum, dum)\n[Verse 1]\nYou can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts\nMichael Vick in this bitch, dawg, fall back, you mutts\nFuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy\nFuck it, a sick duck,\n \nI want my duck sicked, mummy\nAnd my nuts licked, gobble 'em up, trick, yummy\nBitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick? Dummy\nYou'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey\nYeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny\nShorty, dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words\nYou don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker\nMo'fucker, might as well let my lips pucker\nLike Elton John 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker\nThe shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off\nNow I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong\nSo puff the Buddha, light a bong\nBut take a look at Mariah next time I inspire you to write a song\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh\nI'm as cold as the cold wind blows\nWhen it snows and it's twenty below\nAsk me why, man, I just don't know\nKnow-know-know, know-know, know\nI'm as cold as the cold wind blows\nBl-bl-blows, blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh\n[Verse 2]\nFuck it, I'm a loose cannon\nBruce Banner's back in the booth\nY'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'\nI'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out\nStick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around\nMotherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'\nI'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion\nWho the fuck is you pushin'?\nYou must've mistook me for some sissy soft punk \nlookin' for some nookie or bosom\nGo ahead, fuckin' hater, push me\nI told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me\nCall me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy\nMan the fuck up, sissy, Gs up\nAll you gardeners freeze up, \nput your hoes down\n\"Shady, ease up, man, chill,\" nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill\nDrop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill\nShit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'\nAnd Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill (Woo)\nDuring an earthquake\n, \nurine in your face 'cause you're fake\nOw, what the fuck? That hurt, wait\nOw, what the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'\nAlright then, I quit, God, I give up\nCall it evil that men do\nLord, forgive me for what my pen do\n\"This is for your sins, I cleanse you\nYou can repent, but I warn you, if you continue\nTo Hell, I send you\"\nAnd just then the wind blew, and I said—\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh\nI'm as cold as the cold wind blows\nWhen it snows and it's twenty below\nAsk me why, man, I just don't know\nKnow-know-know, know-know, know\nI'm as cold as the cold wind blows\nBl-bl-blows, blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh\n[Verse 3]\nHow long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day\n'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say \"So long\"\n'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs like I missed the pass when I went long\nIf you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong\nNow sing along, \"Slut this, slut that,\" learn the words to the song\n\"Oh, bitches don't like that\"\nHomie, I'll be nicer to women when Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'\nMan, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo\nSo don't compare me to them other bums over there\nIt's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah\nI'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair\nBut I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you\nI put that on everything like everyone does with Auto-Tune\nThe last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme, and say\n\"I was writing this, and I thought of you\"\nSo—\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh\nI'm as cold as the cold wind blows\nWhen it snows and it's twenty below\nAsk me why, man, I just don't know\nKnow-know-know, know-know, know\nI'm as cold as the cold wind blows\nBl-bl-blows, blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh\n[Outro]\nI don't know, I don't know what caused—\nI don't know what caused me to be this way\nI don't know, I don't know\nBut I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day\nI don't know why I'm so—, I'm so cold\nMean things I don't mean to say\nI guess this is how you made me"
