On April 13, 2019, Del Rey shared the full poem on her Instagram account.\n[Stanza 1]\nI saw you in the mirror\nYou were wearing your hair differently\nCarrying the air differently\nYou said you wear your hair long parted in the middle\nLong in solidarity just like all his women\n[Stanza 2]\nIn Long Beach\n[Stanza 3]\nAimless\n[Stanza 4]\nYour fingers wiping oil on the paper with precision\nWith decision like an artist never seen yet with a vision\n[Stanza 5]\nWith a reason\nStared with venom at the ceiling\nNot the grass\nBut straight ahead\nJust at the skyline\nWith precision\nLaser vision\n\n[Stanza 6]\nTime was stopping\nMoving through you\nYou dictated\nby what moved you\n[Stanza 7]\nOnly moving, never thinking\n[Stanza 8]\nMatch to the sun that’s slowly sinking\nAt the height of the afternoon\nIn the heat of the summer evening\nLike a phoenix, like a chem trail, like a wavelength no one’s claiming\n[Stanza 9]\nGeorgia o Keefe\nGeorgia peaches\nDoing nothing but your painting\nFor forever\nForget teachers\nForgive him for ever leaving\n[Stanza 10]\nLove is rising\nNo resisting\nCheeks are flushing\nNow you’re living\n\n[Stanza 11]\nSay goodbye now\nNo resisting\nLive your life like\nNo one's listening\n[Stanza 12]\nBe the art the life is breathing\nBe the soul the world is living\n[Stanza 13]\nFor you only\nNot for giving\nJust for taking\nNo one's listening\n[Stanza 14]\nAt the end of Rose and Rich\nDown the street that’s green and winding\nPast the bushes cypress thriving\nPast the chain link fence and driving\nFurther down the road less travelled\nThere you are athleisure wear unraveled\nNow I see you clear\n[Stanza 15]\nStanding stoic blue and denim\nEyes not blue but clear like heaven\n\n[Stanza 16]\nYou don’t want to be forgotten\n[Stanza 17]\nYou just want to disappear"
