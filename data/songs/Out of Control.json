  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAw, yeah\n[Verse 1]\nOh, my, don't the sky look spacious\nWith the stars all shining down?\nWell, I can hear the night wind howling\nIt's a high and lonesome sound\nAnd I ain't had a woman in so long\nI need to feed my starving soul\nCome on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town\nWe're gonna get a little out of control\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a card game in the corner\nAnd the barmaid smiled at me\nWell, I tipped her a sliver dollar and\nShe brought me a drink for free\nAll the town-folk call her the cheap one\nAnd the gamblers call her Flo\nCome on, set 'em up again, I got me a friend\nAnd I think I'm getting out of control\n[Refrain]\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nShe's cool water, mama taught her\nI got news, she's mine and mine alone\n[Verse 3]\nWell, if anybody's looking for trouble\nYou know I'm the one you want to try\nWell, I'll fight any man who wants to\nAnd I don't care who or why\nYou got to gamble on your story\nYou got no guts, you get no glory\nAnd I'm betting my money on an ace in the hole\nThink I'm getting out of control\n[Outro]\nYou've done it now\nWhere's my baby? Where'd you go, baby?"
