  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nFree like the river\nFlowing freely through infinity\nFree to be sure of\nWhat I am and who I need not be\nFree from all worries\nWorries prey on oneself's troubled mind\nFreer than the clock's hands\nTickin' way the times\nFreer than the meaning of free that man defines\nLife running through me\n'Til I feel my father God has called\n[Verse]\nMe having nothin'\nBut possessing riches more than all\nAnd I'm free\nTo be nowhere\nBut in every place I need to be\nFreer than a sunbeam\nShining through my soul\nFree from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold\nFree from conceiving the beginning\nFor that's the infinite start\nI'm gone - gone but still living\nLife goes on without a beating heart\nFree like a vision\nThat the mind of only you can see\nFreer than a raindrop\nFalling from the sky\nFreer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm free like a river\nFlowin' freely through infinity\nI'm free to be sure of what\nI am and who I need not to be\nI'm much freer, than the meaning of the word free that man, oh, man defines\nFree, free like the vision that\nThe mind of only you are ever gonna see\nFree like the river\nMy life goes on and on through infinity"
