  "lyrics": "Last year, when I wrote you my last letter\nthe beginning of my future poetry\nI acknowledged who you really were for the first time\nI didn’t call you by any other name\nI let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart\nThat it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real\nthat the devil is a real devil\nand that monsters don’t always know that they’re monster\ns\nBut projection is an amazing thing\nafter you left and burnt the house down\nyou tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches\nYou told me that I didn’t know who I was, but I do\nI love rose gardens\nI plant violets every time someone leaves me\nI love the great sequoias of Yosemite\nAnd if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me\nshe would say \"camp fire smoke\"\nI’m gentle\nI’m funny when I’m drunk\nBut I haven’t been drunk for 14 years\nI go on trips with my friends to the beach who don’t know that I’m crazy\nI can do that\nI can do anything\nEven leave you\n\nBecause my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed\ntelling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later\nAnd there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, \nhand carved by old pals from Big Sur\nAnd the longer I stay here\nthe more I am sure\nBut the more I step into becoming a poet\nThe less I will fall into being with you\nThe more I step into my poetry\nThe less I will fall into being with you\nThe more I step into my poetry\nThe less I will fall into bed with you"
