  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's a little bit funny\nThis feelin' inside\nI'm not one of those who can easily hide\nI don't have much money, but boy, if I did\nI'd buy a big house where we both could live\n[Verse 2]\nIf I was a sculptor, heh\nBut then again, no\nOr a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh\nI know it's not much, but it's the best I can do\nMy gift is my song and this one's for you\n[Chorus]\nAnd you can tell everybody\nThis is your song\nIt may be quite simple, but\nNow that it's done\nI hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind\nThat I put down in words\nHow wonderful life is\nWhile you're in the world\n[Verse 3]\nI sat on the roof\nAnd kicked off the moss\nWell, a few of the verses\nWell, they've got me quite cross\nBut the sun's been quite kind\nWhile I wrote this song\nIt's for people like you that keep it turned on\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo excuse me forgettin'\nBut these things I do\nYou see, I've forgotten\nIf they're green or they're blue\nAnyway, the thing is\nWhat I really mean\nYours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen\n[Chorus]\nAnd you can tell everybody\nThis is the song\nIt may be quite simple, but\nNow that it's done\nI hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind\nThat I put down in words\nHow wonderful life is\nWhile you're in the world\n[Outro]\nI hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind\nThat I put down in words\nHow wonderful life is\nWhile you're in the world"
