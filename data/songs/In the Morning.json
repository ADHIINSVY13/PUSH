  "lyrics": "In the morning, when the moon is at its rest\nYou will see me at the time I love the best\nWatching rainbows play on sunlight\nPools of water iced from cold nights\nIn the morning\n'Tis the morning of my life\nIn the daytime I will meet you as before\nYou will find me waiting by the ocean floor\nBuilding castles in the shifting sands\nIn a world that no one understands\nIn the morning\n'Tis the morning of my life\n'Tis the morning of my life\nIn the morning of my life\nThe minutes take so long to drift away\nPlease be patient with your life\nIt's only morning and you're still to live your day\nIn the evening I will fly you to the moon\nTo the top right hand corner of\nThe ceiling in my room\nWhere we'll stay until the sun shines\nAnother day to swing on clothes lines\nMay I be yawning\n'Tis the morning of my life\n'Tis the morning of my life\n\nIn the morning\nIn the morning\nIn the morning"
