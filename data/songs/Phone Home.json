That'll lead to my advantage\nBecause I've got to eat, and for real I'm feeling kind of famished\nHotter than the Earth core, don't show me where no fan is\nShow me where your fans is, so they can see the real\nI'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill\nMe feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend\nBut I'm not an actor, put that in my will\nGimme a second, uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing\nShe want the raw, so I fed her lines like Kevin\nTell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5'6\" Bigfoot\nLearjet overlook the country like Garth Brooks\nLyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks\nLike Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn\nI'm not concerned about the SoundScan\n'Cause most of y'all is drowning, a lifeguard that's lounging\nMeaning I don't worry about none of you rappers\nI'm way more live, that's \"evil\" backwards\nNow with that great wordplay, I tend to let my words play\nLike children on a Saturday, it's sad to say\nYou're not up to par, and I don't play with mini-golf and sharks\nJump inside the pool of sharks,\n we're biting off your head\nYour heart, your legs, arms, \nbled\nLike Jay Rock or Big Wy\nAnd make sure you wear a vest, because they my family ties\nSuit up\nYou got a three piece?\n I got a three piece\nA MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE, \nhe backpedaling like a DB\nI'm such a Martian, call me ET\nAlways behind it like I own the TP\nI shit, fart, pee-pee\n \non anybody track\nWalk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax\nWassup, now phone home\nMy nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down\n\n[Verse 2: Punch]\nYour boy carry that flame, I am a arsonist\nI spit arsenic at you niggas' cartilage\nI'll wwip, drive by, niggas carsick\n20 on the charm, VVS studded flawless\nTry and reach, we specialize in garbage\nTaking out the trash, put you underneath the Tar Pits\nHow many times I gotta tell y'all niggas?\nThe big fish in the small pond, I wail on niggas, I'm vicious\nNo, I'm serious, skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean\nYou niggas ain't listening\nI'm not from 'round these parts, I'm non-existent\nHit you with brake light, leave you missing"
