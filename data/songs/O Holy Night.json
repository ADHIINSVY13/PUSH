  "lyrics": "O holy night! The stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night of the dear Saviour's birth\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\nTill He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth\nA thrill of hope\nThe weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn\nFall on your knees!\nOh, hear the angel voices!\nO night divine, the night when Christ was born;\nO night, O holy night, O night divine!\nO night, O holy night, O night divine!\n[?] [sounds like a non-English language]\nLed by the light of faith serenely beaming\nWith glowing hearts by His cradle we stand\nO'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming\nNow come the wisemen from out of the Orient land\nThe King of kings lay thus lowly manger;\nIn all our trials born to be our friends\nHe knows our need, our weakness is no stranger\nBehold your King! Before him lowly bend!\nBehold your King! Before him lowly bend!\nTruly He taught us to love one another\nHis law is love and His gospel is peace\nChains he shall break, for the slave is our brother\nAnd in his name all oppression shall cease\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we\nWith all our hearts we praise His holy name\nChrist is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we\nHis power and glory ever more proclaim!\nHis power and glory ever more proclaim!"
