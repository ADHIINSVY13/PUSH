  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPlease don't go\nStay though it hurts you, I know\nIn the moonlight bright\nAnd the shadows cold\nYou know you belong to me\n[Verse 2]\nI see your face\nYour love seems a lifetime away\nBut the shadows come\nAnd the shadows go\nYou know you belong to me\n[Bridge]\nWhen the night falls\nWhen the tears come\nWhen the pain makes you afraid\nLet the wind blow\nLet the clouds come\nLet the rain wash it away\n[Verse 3]\nFor love is strange\nIt goes through every possible change\nWhen the crying’s done\nAnd the shadows go\nYou know you belong to me\n\n[Outro]\nIn the moonlight bright\nAnd the shadows cold\nYou know I belong to you"
