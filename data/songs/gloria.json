You looked at me and said, \"Baby, dry your eyes\nDepend on me as your relief, let your anger be mine\"\nWe was locked in ever since then\nSo territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hmm, hmm (Gah, gah, gah)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nScared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass\nI just gotta let you know, woah\nWhenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time\nOoh, just gotta let you know\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nSaid you gon' see other people if I didn't grow with you\nWasn't no more holdin' them pistols in front of stores with you\nYou want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you\nTo tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do\nIn 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger\nMy eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us\nOf course I had to wrap it up, I didn't fully trust you\nFabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, \"Fuck you\"\n[Interlude: SZA & \nKendrick Lamar\n]\nNigga, what?\nI gave you life, I breathe the motherfuckin' charisma in this bitch\nI bring the blessings, I gave you power\nNigga, I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle\nThen fall right back in love the very moment that I touch you\n (Gah, gah, gah)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nScared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass\nI just gotta let you know\nWhenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time\nOoh, just gotta let you know\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nYou were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous\nLife of passion, laughin' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin'\nDumb enough to ill reaction, ain't no disrespect\nHighly sensitive, possessed, saw potential, even when it's tragic\nSo jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some bitches\nWrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious\nWho you foolin'? I know what you doin', you my contradiction\n'Member when you caught that body and still wiggled through that sentence?\nLoved you more, when you flip and lose your shit, I hugged you more\nIt's sexy to me, cuss they ass out and hold that grudge some more\nDown bitch, I know your favorite movie, is it \nNotebook?\nSo good, if they all sub me, get 'em all booked\nMy baby boo, you either heal niggas or you kill niggas\nBoth is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you\nLogical explanation don't exist, flippin' pages\nChapter after chapter, probably remarry and head to Vegas\nBitches gettin' marked out, they can't erase our history\nThey margins ain't big enough, they all led by bigotry\nMy woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin\nAin't no bitch like my bitch 'cause that bitch been my pen\n\n[Outro: SZA]\nGloria, I wanna take you to euphoria\nBitches want, but they ain't strong enough\nI heard they talking, we notorious\nIf someone talking on me\nI see you, you see me\nBoth see what we want, oh, oh\nI see you, you see me\nBoth see what we want"
