No way, let's go buy 'em\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]\nWe want flyin' shoes\nWe want shoes that can fly\n[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo, \nMadison Hu\n & \nBoth\n]\nCan we see your flying shoes?\nEverything came to a halt\nHe said, \"Follow me, 'cause we keep 'em in a vault\"\nLed me and Paige to the back of the store\nTo a room that said \"Flyin' shoes only\" on the door\nHe punched in the code, and to our surprise\nThere were two pair left, \njust in our size\nOne was all silver,\n one gold and white\nWe had our flyin' shoes, \nwe were ready to take flight\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]\nWe got flyin' shoes\nWe got shoes that can fly\nLift off!\n\n[Verse 3: Olivia Rodrigo, \nMadison Hu\n & \nBoth\n]\n'Cause you know we on fleek\nLet's do a fly-by,\n \nour friends are gonna freak\nYou wish you had these shoes,\n now what should we do?\nLet's pull a U-ey and hit the drive-thru\nWhat do we want? \nTwo chocolate shakes\nOur shoes are actin' funny, \nthere's a problem with the brakes\nScreech\n, shake to the face, \nwe can't see\nCrash into each other, \nthen we crash into a tree\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]\nWe don't need no flyin' shoes\nJust some shoes that are fly\nLet's return these flyin' shoes\n'Cause we're too young to die\n[Outro: Madison Hu, \nOlivia Rodrigo\n & \nBoth\n]\nLooks like these have been used\nJust normal wear and tear,\n from the street\nNo problem, we can take these back, assuming you still have your receipt\nReceipt? No!"
