(How bad, bad do you want me?)\n(How bad, bad do you want me?)\n'Cause you hate thе crash, but you love the rush\nAnd I'll make your hеart weak every time\nYou hear my name, 'cause she's in your brain\nAnd I'm here to kiss you in real life\n'Bout to cause a scene\nHow bad, bad do you want me?\n[Verse 2]\nYou panic in your sleep (Panic in your sleep)\nAnd you feel like such a creep (Feel like such a creep)\n'Cause with your eyes closed, you might peek\nSo hot, hot that you can't speak\nYou're so fucked up with your crew (Fucked up with your crew)\nBut when you're all alone, it's true (All alone, it's true)\nYou know exactly what we'd do\nHow bad, bad do you want to?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans\nYou like the bad girl I got in me\nShe's on your mind, like, all the time\nBut I got a tattoo for us last week\nEven good boys bleed\nHow bad, bad do you want me?
