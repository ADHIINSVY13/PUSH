  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy eyes are dry, my love\nSince you've been gone, I haven't shed a tear\nI'll never cry, my love\nThough every day seems like a hundred years\nFor I'm just a fool who clings to his pride\nBut when I'm alone, I can hear the sound of\n[Chorus]\nRain in my heart, of the tears that I hide\nAnd it tears me apart 'cause I keep them inside\nI can't get away from the sound of the rain in my heart\n[Verse 2]\nHow could I know, my love\nI was a toy? Only a game to you?\nHow could you go, my love\nWithout a thought of what I'm going through?\nHow can I forget I still love you so?\nIt echoes each time that I hear the sound of\n[Chorus]\nRain in my heart from the tears that I hide\nThough it tears me apart, I still keep them inside\nBut I can't escape from the sound of the rain in my heart\n\n[Outro]\nI hear that rain in my heart, of the tears that I hide\nAnd it tears me apart 'cause I keep them inside"
