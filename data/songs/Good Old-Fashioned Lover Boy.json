  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can dim the lights and sing you songs\nFull of sad things\nWe can do the tango, just for two\nI can serenade and gently play\nOn your heart strings\nBe a Valentino, just for you\n[Chorus]\n\"\nOoh love, ooh lover boy\nWhat're you doing tonight?\"\nSet my alarm, turn on my charm\nThat's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy\n[Verse 2]\nOoh, let me feel\nYour heartbeat (Grow faster, faster)\nOoh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)\nCome on and sit on my hot seat of love\nAnd tell me how do you feel, right after all\nI'd like for you and I to go romancing\nSay the word, your wish is my command\n[Chorus]\n\"Ooh love, ooh lover boy\nWhat're you doing tonight? Hey boy\"\nWrite my letter, feel much better\nI'll use my fancy patter on the telephone\n\n[Bridge: Freddie Mercury, \nMike Stone\n]\nWhen I'm not with you, think of you always\nI miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)\nWhen I'm not with you, think of me always\nLove you, love you\nHey boy where do you get it from?\nHey boy where did you go?\nI learned my passion in the good old-fashioned\nSchool of lover boys\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 3]\nDining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine\n(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock) precisely\nI will pay the bill, you taste the wine\nDriving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely\nJust take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)\n[Chorus]\nOoh love \n(There he goes again)\nOoh lover boy (Who's my good Old-fashioned lover boy?)\n(Ooh ooh)\nWhat're you doing tonight? Hey boy!\nEverything's all right, just hold on tight\nThat's because I'm a good old\nFashioned (Fashioned) lover boy"
