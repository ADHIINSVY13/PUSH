  "lyrics": "Ooh you're a holiday, ev'ry day, such a holiday\nNow it's my turn to say, and I say you're a holiday\nIt's something I think's worthwhile\nIf the puppet makes you smile\nIf not then you're throwing stones\nThrowing stones, throwing stones\nOoh it's a funny game\nDon't believe that it's all the same\nCan't think what I've just said\nPut the soft pillow on my head\nIf millions of eyes can see\nYet why am I so blind\nWhen that someone else is me\nIt's unkind, it's unkind\nDe de de de de    de de de de de de de\nDe de de de de de de de de de de\nI walk the lonely streets\nI watch the people passing by\nI used to smile and say hello\nI guess that I was just a happy guy\nThen you happened, girl\nThis feeling that possesses me\nI just can't move myself\nI guess it all just had to be\n\nI can't see nobody...no\nNo, I can't see nobody...oh no\nMy eyes can only look at you...\nBaby...\nI can't see nobody...oh no\nNo, I can't see nobody...oh no\nMy eyes can only look at you...\nI started a joke, which started the whole world crying\nBut I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no\nI started to cry, which started the whole world laughing\nOh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me\nI looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes\nAnd I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said\nTil I finally died, which started the whole world living\nOh, if I'd only seen, oh no, that the joke was on me...oh no\nThat the joke was on me\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh no\nFeel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts\nSomething's telling me I must go home\nAnd the lights all went out in Massachusetts\nThe day I left her standing on her own\n\nTalk about the life in Massachusetts\nSpeak about the people I have seen\nAnd the lights all went out in Massachusetts\nAnd Massachusetts is one place I have seen\nI will remember Massachusetts...oh yeah\nI will remember Massachusetts...oh yeah\nOh"
