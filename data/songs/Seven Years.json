  "lyrics": "Spinning, laughing\nDancing to her favorite song\nA little girl with nothing wrong\nIs all alone\nEyes wide open\nAlways hoping for the sun\nAnd she'll sing her song to anyone\nThat comes along\nFragile as a leaf in autumn\nJust fallin' to the ground\nWithout a sound\nCrooked little smile on her face\nTells a tale of grace\nThat's all her own\nFragile as a leaf in autumn\nJust fallin' to the ground\nWithout a sound\nSpinning, laughing\nDancing to her favorite song\nShe's a little girl with nothing wrong\nAnd she's all alone\nA little girl with nothing wrong\nAnd she's all alone"
