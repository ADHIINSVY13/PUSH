Can they hear us? (Ooh)\n[Verse 2]\nAnywhere that I turn to got me goin' in circles\nNo matter what, I'll make sure we get out\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause we all die, but right now I feel like livin'\nAnd we all cry, but right now I'm not gonna give in\nWhen we collide I know I can do anything\n'Cause I got ya, and you got me\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ooh) Can they hear us?\nBlame it on my mind, blame it on delirious\nWe all die, but right now I feel like livin'\nCan they hear us? Can they hear us?\n[Saxophone Solo]\n[Chorus]\n(Ooh) Can they hear us? (Us)\nBlame it on my mind, blame it on delirious\nWe all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')\nCan they hear us? Can they hear us?\nCan they hear us?\nBlame it on my mind, blame it on delirious (Blame it on delirious)\nWe all die, but right now I feel like livin' (I feel like livin')\nCan they hear us? Can they hear us?"
