(What, uh)\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\n[Verse 2]\nFrom Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat\nTwenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back\nHolding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back\nLiving with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet\nTwo sips from bein' alcoholic\nNine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich\nBut now, I'm all for it\nMy man saw it like Dionne Warwick\nA wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with\nThe cartel, Argentina coke with the nina\nUp in the hotel, \nsmokin' on Sessamina\nTrina got the fishscale between her\nThe way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her\nShe got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar\nGuess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins\nBitches blow me while I'm hoppin' in the drop-top BM'\nWord is bond (Uh), son (What), I had that bitch down on my shit  (What, uh) like this (\nWord\n)\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\n[Verse 3]\nGrowing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming\nScoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing\nCars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans\nG'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing\nYoung, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady\nWorshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me\nThe street raised me up giving a fuck\nI thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up\nI knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\nCut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy\nAin't that funny? Getting put on to crack money\nWith all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry\nA case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years\nSome niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career\nBut I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt\nWith Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out\n(Uh, what, what, uh)\n\n[Chorus]\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nNiggas push Bimmers and 300 E's\nA drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key\nEverybody's looking for something\nStreet dreams are made of these\nShorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese\nWho am I to disagree?\nEverybody's looking for something\n[Skit]\n*Gunshot*\n\"Yeah nigga, what?!\"\n\"Oh, shit!\"\n\"Queensbridge, boy, what?!
