  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSitting in my room\nWhat's it all about?\nFeels like the world is gonna end\nBefore I figure her out\nDrink up, my friend\nMy potion of emotion\nCan you feel the love, the hate\nThe jealousy, the sheer confusion?\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I don't really know who I am\nOr how to present that to you\nI don't really know just who I am\nI'm a rebel without a clue (Ooh, oh)\n[Verse 2]\nLet's sit\nWatch the trains all derail\nThey want me to learn\nWell, they can sit and watch me fail\nAre my friends changing\nOr is it in my mind?\nWill I ever shake hands\nWith time? (Mmm)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I don't really know who I am\nOr how to present that to you\nI don't really know just who I am\nI'm a rebel without a clue (Ooh)\nNo, I don’t really know who I am\nAnd now you want me to change\nI don't really know what I am\nIsn't everything just so strange?\n[Outro]\nSitting in my room\nWhat's it all about?"
