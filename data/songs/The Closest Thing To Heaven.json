The answer to all of my prayers\nPromise me you'll always be there\n[Chorus]\nYou're the closest thing\nTo heaven in my world\nNever take this heaven from my arms\nDon't take your love from me\nOr you'll take everything\nYou're the closest thing\nTo heaven that I've ever seen\nYou are, you are the closest thing to heaven\nYou are [2x]"
