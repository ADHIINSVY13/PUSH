  "lyrics": "I know how I feel\nLonely in the black of night\nThere can be no love for me now\nNobody listens when the words ain't right\nAnd you get into someone else\nIt's hard for me to know\nWho's lovin' who\nAnd where do I stand\nWhat did I do it all for\nThere's no one I could love more\nI did it for your heart alone\nAll that I try to be growin' inside to me\nI can be strong if you're there\nAnd there is someone belonging to someone\nAnd I got no one belonging to me\nCaught in a world where the face of an angel is all that a fool can see\nYou got the power to find me whenever I'm lost\nWhere are you? Who are we?\nI believe in time\nCan eat away a heart of stone\nAnd baby if I leave you too late\nIt's just a feather and the bird has flown\nIt's colder when the fire dies\nWith all the trouble I'm in if I lose you too\nThen what is my life\nIf I don't wanna go through\nAnything without you\nCouldn't be a life at all\nI could be lyin' on\nYou are the only one\nWe didn't make it by chance\n\nAnd there is someone belonging to someone\nAnd I got no one belonging to me\nI'm caught in a world on the edge of tomorrow\nIt's all that a fool can find\nI don't belong in the arms of a love that is lost\nNowhere to cry\nThere must be something we can say my love\nSomething except goodbye\nThen what is my life\nIf I don't wanna go through\nAnything without you\nCouldn't be life at all\nI could be lyin' on\nYou are the only one\nWe didn't make it by chance\nAnd there is someone belonging to someone\nAnd I got no one belonging to me\nAnd there is someone belonging to someone\nAnd I got no one belonging to me"
