  "lyrics": "This is a man's world, this is a man's world\nBut it wouldn't, it wouldn't be nothing\nNothing without a woman or a girl\nYou see, man made the cars to take us over the road\nMan made the trains to carry the heavy load\nMan makes the electric lights to take us out of the dark\nMan made the boat for the water like Noah made the ark\nThis is a man's, a man's world\nBut it wouldn't be nothing\nWithout a woman, a woman or a girl\nNow listen\nMan thinks about little bitty baby girls and baby boys\nMan makes them happy 'cause man, he makes them toys\nAnd after man has made everything, everything, everything he can\nYou know that man makes money to buy from other man\nBut this is a man, a man's world\nBut it wouldn't be nothing, nothing\nWithout a woman or a girl\nI said, \"He's lost, lost in the world of a man, oh yeah\"\nAnd he's lost, lost in bitterness\nThis is a man, this is a man's world, oh yeah\nThis is a man's world\n\nThis is a man, man, a man's world\nOh, but it would be nothing without a woman or girl\nI said it would be, it would be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing\nWithout a woman, nothing without a woman or a girl\nThis is a man's world, this is a man's, this is a man's world\nI know, you know it this is a man`s world\nThis is a man's, a man's world\nBut it would be nothing, nothing without a woman or girl\nWithout a woman or girl\nThis is, this is, this is a man, a man's world"
