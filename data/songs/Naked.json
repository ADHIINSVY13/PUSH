Ah\n[Verse 1]\nI don't think 'bout anybody\nBut bein' beside your body, baby (La-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)\nYou can leave open windows\nDon't care who see me out my clothes, baby\nYeah, I like bananas and peaches\nAnd some might say it's indecent\nThat's just crazy (That's just crazy)\nCan I slide outta mine and into yours?\nHeels on, waitin' at your door\nI don't wanna play no more\nLeave everything on the floor\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou don't need a pole to see me strip\nOnly thing I want zipped is your lips\nTake it to the top, boy, skinny dip\n(So hot, your body on mine, your body on)\nI don't even wanna get a grip\nI just like it when you grab my hips\nCan you feel it through your fingertips? (How do I?)\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I keep this on?\nHow do I let you know?\nBoy, you deserve a show\nDeserve to get comfortable\nIt's only natural\nI could tell when you locked the door\nJust what was going on\nBoy, can we take off all our clothes?\nWhen can we take off all our clothes?\nWhen can we take off all our clothes? (When? Oh whoa)\nWhen can we take off all our clothes?\n[Refrain]\nBaby, you're so anxious\nYou can't take it\nCan we take this off and get naked?\nCan we take this off and get naked?\nCan we take this off and get nake—?\nBaby, you're so anxious\nYou can't take it\nCan we take this off and get naked?\nCan we take this off and get naked?\nCan we take this off and get naked? Ah\n[Verse 2]\nFollow me to my dressin' room\nLet me know if you ain't 'bout that NSFW\nNow it's safe to finish what we started\nFirst impression of you is you really like to party\nSwirlin' all up on you 'cause you know I wanna dance\nLet me cordially invite you to this party in my pants\nHow you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?\nShow me all your tatts, not just the ones that's on your hands\nWho's your designer?\nIs that birthday suit one of a kind, uh?\nEverything about you look like it's on purpose\nGod was workin', probably took some extra time though\nAyy, all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mmm\nJigsaw, let me see your muscleses, mmm\nAfter we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle\nWe could take it to the kitchen\nI'll be on the island, come and eat, mmm\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do I keep this on?\nHow do I let you know?\nBoy, you deserve a show\nDeserve to get comfortable\nIt's only natural\nI could tell when you locked the door\nJust what was going on\nBoy, can we take off all our clothes?\n(Anxious, you can't take it)\n(Can we take this off and get naked?)\nWhen can we take off all our clothes?\n(Can we take this off and get naked?)\n(Can we take this off and get naked?)\nWhen can we take off all our clothes? (When? Oh, whoa)\n(Feelin' so anxious, can't take it)\n(Can we take this off and get naked?)\nWhen can we take off all our clothes?\n(Can we take this off and get naked?)\n(Can we take this off and get naked? Ah)\n[Outro]\nTouch, touch my body\nJust touch, touch my body\nJust touch me\nAyy, touch my body, just\n(Touch me, touch me)\nYeah, touch, touch my body\nJust touch, touch my body\nJust touch me\nUh, touch my body, yeah\nTouch me, baby\n(Touch, touch my body)\n(Just touch me, touch me, baby, yeah)\n(Touch you, touch my body, just)"
