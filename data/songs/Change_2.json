Oh\nRight now I know the truth about you and your new lover\n(Why you wanna hurt the man that gave you everything I could possibly give you?)\nI'm running for cover\nCome say what you wanna say\n(Now you gon' walk out on me?)\nSay what you're gonna do\n(Now you gon' step on my heart?)\nI can't stand the way you treat me\n(I can't stand it, baby)\nI'm giving up on you\n(I got to walk away from you) Oh\n\n[Outro]\nYou know I had to realize your love was just a game\nOh, change\nNow I've got to take time to stop and rearrange\nChange\nI've got to walk away from you before I lose my mind\nOh, change\n'Cause all I'm gonna do with you is just keep wasting time\nChange\nYou hurt me (Oh, change)\nEverybody's talking, walking around talking about me and you\nYour lover (Change)\nCan't believe it, baby, just can't believe it (I need a change)\nHow could this happen? (Ooh) What did I do to you? (Change)\nWhat did I do wrong? Tell me, baby (Oh, change)\nTell me something (Uh, uh, uh, uh, change)\nI need a change, I need to walk away (I need a change)"
