  "lyrics": "“Animals” is about the bloodthirsty capitalists who will get what’s coming to them for eating the public alive.\n[Verse 1]\nAnimal, you're an animal\nDon't take anything less\nOut of control, you're out of control\nStrike those in distress\n[Chorus]\nAnalyse, advertise, expand\nBend more rules and buy yourself an island\n[Verse 2]\nAnimals, we're animals\nBuy when blood is on the street\nOut of control, we're out of control\nCrush those who beg at your feet\n[Chorus]\nAnalyse, franchise, spread out\nKill the competition and buy yourself an ocean\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nAmortise, downsize, lay off\nKill yourself, come on and do us all a favour\n\n[Instrumental Outro]"
