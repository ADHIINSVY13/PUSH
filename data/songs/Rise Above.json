These niggas is all alike”\nShe gon' set it off, her daughter gon' witness it all tonight, damn\n\n[Chorus]\nRise above, rise above\nAnd you've got to\nRise above, rise above\n[Verse 2]\nShe said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition\nNow she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference\nAye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don't listen\nA ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?\nI'm fuckin' with you, but for real, she say they hopeless\nA class full of jokesters, creatin' all the obstacles, impossible to focus\nLittle niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need\nAnd they don't even try\n, \none little boy, he caught her eye\n'Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin' to call his mother\nBut she act like she don't care\nWhat father? He ain't here\nNow she frustrated, thinkin' that she just made the mistake of her life\nUnderpaid, be havin' to waitress at night\nSix years of college down the drain, drinkin', tryna drown her pain\nParty with her girls, feeling sorry for the world\n'Cause ain't no hope for the youth, well ain't that the truth\nWhen all your role models either rappin' or they hoop, damn\n[Chorus]\nRise above, rise above\nAnd you've got to\nRise above, rise above"
