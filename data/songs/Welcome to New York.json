  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWalkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow\nKaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats\nEverybody here wanted somethin' more\nSearchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before\nAnd it said\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore\nThe lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\n[Verse 2]\nWhen we first dropped our bags on apartment floors\nTook our broken hearts, put them in a drawer\nEverybody here was someone else before\nAnd you can want who you want\nBoys and boys and girls and girls\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore\nThe lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me\nWelcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\n\n[Bridge]\nLike any great love, it keeps you guessing\nLike any real love, it's ever-changing\nLike any true love, it drives you crazy\nBut you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nWelcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York\nIt's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat\nThe lights are so bright, but they never blind me\nWelcome to New York (New soundtrack), it's been waitin' for you\nWelcome to New York, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me\nWelcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me, yeah\nWelcome to New York, welcome to New York"
