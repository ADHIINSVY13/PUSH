Nigga, I can name several\nSituations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'\nA baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?\nWhere was your antennas?\nWhere was the influence you speak of?\nYou preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her\nI fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader\nI never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you\nThe world don't need you, don't let them deceive you\nNumbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication\nThought money would change you, made you more complacent\nFuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nI swear, loving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, \nSZA & Bilal\n]\nLovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100 proof\nI can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me\nYes, I hate you, too\n[Part II]\n[Intro: Jessica Vielmas & \nWhoarei\n]\n(\nLoving you ain't really complicated\n)\nHousekeeping, housekeeping\n(\nWhat I got to do to get to you?\n)\n¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta, tengo que limpiar el cuarto!\n(\nTo you\n)\n¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo! ¡Tengo que limpiar el cuarto!\n(\nLoving you ain't really complicated\n)\n¡Disculpe!\n(\nWhat I got to do to get to you?\n)\n(\nTo you\n)\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nAnd you the reason why mom and them leavin'\nNo, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it\nI know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it\nYour trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it\nEveryone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out\nYou was deserted, where was your antennas again?\nWhere was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?\nYou ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend\nA friend never leave Compton for profit,\n or leave his best friend, \nlittle brother\nYou promised you'd watch him before they shot him\nWhere was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches\nYou FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven\nYou even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit\nGuess you thought he'd recover well\nThird surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real\nThen he died, God himself will say, \"You fuckin' failed,\" you ain't try\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga\nI know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga\nI know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga\nY'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga\nAnd if this bottle could talk\nI cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault\nFaults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend\nBecause you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed\nI know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world about that shit you thinkin'\nAnd that time that— I'm 'bout to hurl\nI'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you\nYou just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof\nShould've killed yo' ass long time ago\nYou should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago\nAnd if these mirrors could talk, it'll say, \"You gotta go\"\nAnd if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness"
