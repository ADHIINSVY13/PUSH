  "artist": "David Bowie",
  "lyrics": "[Intro riff]\n[Verse 1]\nI staggered through this criminal reign\nI'm not in love, no phony pain\nCreeping through this tidal wave\nNo warm embrace, just a lover's grave\nThis symphony\nThis rage in me\nI've got a handful of songs to sing\nTo sting your soul\nTo fuck you over\nThis furious reign\n[Hook]\nI'm falling, man\nI'm choking, man\nI'm fading, man\nI'm the broken line\nI'm falling, man\nI'm choking, man\nI'm fading, man\nJust killing a little time\n[Verse 2]\nI love the sound of an empty room\nThe screams of night, the end of love\nTwo beating hearts, one labored start\nOne open wound, wasted and drawn\nNo sympathy\nThis furious reign\nI lay in bed\nThe monster fed, the body bled\nI turned and said\n\"I get some of you all the time\nAll of you some other time\"\nThis rage in me\nGet away from me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm falling, man\nI'm choking, man\nI'm fading, man\nI'm the broken line\nI'm falling, man\nI'm choking, man\nI'm fading, man\nJust killing a little time\n[Outro]\nThis symphony\nGet away from me"
