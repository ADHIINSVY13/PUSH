(How?)\nHow you be using your tongue? (How?)\nYou be so worried 'bout mine (Mine)\nCan't even get yourself none\nYou know you sound so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)\nYou know you sound so dumb (So dumb)\n[Chorus]\nSo maybe you should shut up, mmm\nYeah, maybe you should shut up\nSaid if only you would shut up (Mmm)\nYeah, that's right, you should shut up (Ah)\n[Verse 2]\nI vibrate high and my circle lit\nWe ain't really with drugs and shit\nLove the game so I ain't nevеr miss\nKeep opinions muted for the hell of it\n'Causе I like my shit (Mmm, yep)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHow you been spending your time? (How?)\nHow you be using your tongue? (How?)\nYou be so worried 'bout mine (Mine)\nCan't even get yourself none\nYou know you sound so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)\nYou know you sound so dumb (So dumb)\n[Chorus]\nSo maybe you should shut up, mmm\nYeah, maybe you should shut up\nSaid if only you would shut up (Mmm)\nYeah, that's right, you should shut up (Ah)"
