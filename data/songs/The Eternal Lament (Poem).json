  "lyrics": "pages 16 & 17\nFrom my mind 2 the depths of my soul\nI yearn 2 achieve all of my goals\nAnd all of my free time will be spent\nOn the 1's I miss I will lament\nI am not a perfectionist\nBut still I seek perfection\nI am not a great romantic\nBut yet I yearn 4 affection\nEternally my mind will produce\nways 2 put my talents 2 use\nand when I'm done no matter where I've been\nI'll yearn 2 do it all again."
