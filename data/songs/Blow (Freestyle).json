  "lyrics": "Pusha nails this freestyle on The Funkmaster Flex show chronicling how his art is his way of explaining his life while rebuking all the phonies out there.\n[Verse]\nMalice found religion, Tony found prison\nI’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen\nA birds eye view got me channelling my vision\nTurn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling\nFather knows best, wash my hands all's forgiven\nWe kicking up dust like the colosseum floors\nWalls full of safes like they mausoleum doors\nPussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue\nGrants, Jacksons, no room for George\nYeh, the fear of God’s in you muthafuckas\nThis art imitate my life\nYour World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white\nEliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice\nMy music for your soul, inspiration for your life\nEvery dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous\nHelp my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors\nSent my old bitch right back to get her Masters\nSame graduation I was clapping in the rafters\nThe truth hurts everytime it’s revealed\nWhat goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel\nGrab hold and reverse the steering wheel\nAs I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill\nThe fact that I’m free lets me know God is great\nTen year marathon of me selling concentrate\nThese rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear\nVillain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear\nNo weapon formed against me shall prosper\nHakuna matata,\n \nfeet up sipping java\nStrolling up the totem pole, what’s my only problem?\nScrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler\nSo many hands raised as the band plays\nI’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change\nFirst class flights, Ciroc soaked nights\nWaking up to models, what a motherfuckin life"
