(Will you take me there?)\nWill you (Oh), take me (Wanna go)\nTo the planet (Yeah), you're from?\n(All women are beautiful where I come from)\n[Verse 2]\nYou gotta be from something out of this world\n('Cause they don't make 'em quite as bad as you on this planet baby)\nYour eyes make me feel\n(Like flying far away with you tonight)\nTake me for a ride I wish that you will\n(So look and tell me more about you)\nOr maybe show me something else just as beautiful\n(But you know that ain't happening)\n\n[Chorus]\nWill you, take me\nTo the planet, you're from?\nWill you, take me\nTo the planet, you're from?\n[Verse 3]\n(Hey) Can't imagine being in a place where everybody as fine as you\n(Trust me, beyond your wildest dreams)\nCouldn't live without it baby there's no doubt about it\n(Okay then, come with me)\n[Chorus]\nWill you, take me\nTo the planet, you're from?\nWill you, take me\nTo the planet, you're from?\n[Chorus]\nWill you, take me\nTo the planet, you're from?\nWill you, take me\nTo the planet, you're from?\n(You're from, you're from, you're from)"
