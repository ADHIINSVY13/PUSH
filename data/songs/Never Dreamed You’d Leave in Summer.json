  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI never dreamed you'd leave in summer\nI thought you would go then come back home\nI thought the cold would leave by summer\nBut my quiet nights will be spent alone\n[Verse 2]\nYou said there would be warm love in springtime\nThat is when you started to be cold\nI never dreamed you'd leave in summer\nBut now I find myself all alone\n[Verse 3]\nYou said then you'd be the life in autumn\nSaid you'd be the one to see the way\nNo, I never dreamed you'd leave in summer\nBut now I find my love has gone away\nWhy didn't you stay?"
