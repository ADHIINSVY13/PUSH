Look\n\n[Chorus]\nMy bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop\nI tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop\nGetting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots\nThen I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy\nMy bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop\nI tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop\nGetting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots\nThen I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy\nLondon"
