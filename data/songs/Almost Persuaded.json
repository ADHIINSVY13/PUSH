  "lyrics": "Last night, all alone at a party\nI met a man with a drink in his hand\nHe had soft brown eyes and coal black hair\nAnd a smile a girl could understand\nThen he came and sat down at my table\nAnd placed his warm hand on mine, now\nAnd I found myself wanting, longing to kiss him, yes I did\nFor temptation was flowing like wine\nAnd oh I was all, almost persuaded\nTo strip myself apart, apart, yes\nOh almost, nearly persuaded now\nTo push my, push my ole conscience right on the side\nThen we danced, then we danced, he whispered, \"Baby, I need you now\"\nHe said to me, \"Let me take you away, ooh I wanna be your man\"\nThan I looked in his eyes and I saw it, yeah I saw it\nI saw the reflection of my, my wedding band\nOh I was almost, almost, almost persuaded, yes I was\nTo let a strange lips, somebody's lips lure me, lure me on, now\nOh I was almost, yeah nearly, nearly persuaded\nBut your, your sweet love made me stop, made me stop and go on"
