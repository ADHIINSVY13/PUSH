Get to be by your side\nI say these words tonight\nYou are my pure daylight\nI want to stay with you\nAnd love my life away it's a brand new day\nIt seems like heaven\nWhen I'm laying with you\nIt feels so good. There's no angel\nThat can compare to you\nYou're not of this world\nGirl I smile, xause you let\nEverybeat of my heart\nFeels so right, with you I have\nA brand new start\nYour beauty is in my eyes\nMy heart I can't deny\nI want to stay with you, and love my life away\nIt's brand new day\nIt feels like heaven, when I'm laying with you\nIt feels so good.There's no angel\nThat can compare to you\nYou're not of this world\n\nYour beauty is in my eyes\nMy heart I can't deny\nI want to stay with you, and love my life away\nIt's brand new day\nIt feels like heaven, when I'm laying with you\nIt feels so good.There's no angel\nThat can compare to you\nYou're not of this world\nIt feels like heaven, when I'm laying with you\nIt feels so good.There's no angel\nThat can compare to you\nYou're not of this world"
