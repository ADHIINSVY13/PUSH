  "lyrics": "In the history of\nA life takes a heart\nWhen the power of love comes together\nThere is nothing can tear us apart\nAnd the touch of your hand I can feel\nThat what we got is stronger than steel\nThat's when you hear\nMy lover's prayer\nIt's my own silent message to you\nTakes me there, my lover's prayer\nAnd my soul is divided in two\nWith my love on the line\nI send it all over the world\nOut on the air\n'Cause I can't let go\nAnd my heart has a mind of it's own\nIt's my lover's prayer\nIt's the mystery of\nA place blessed by us\nAnd the moment of truth is forever\nIn the face of incredible odds\nAnd the look in your eyes tells me why\nLet our words burn a sign in the sky\n\nMy lover's prayer\nIt's as easy as talking to you\nAll my life, having you there\nIn my own private vision come true\nYou're heaven on earth\nYou're the fire and all that I'm worth\nAnd I can be strong\nYou hold the key\nDon't say it's over\nDon't say it's over for me\nMy lover's prayer\nIt's as easy as talking to you\nAll my life, having you there\nIn my own private vision come true\nIn my search for your love\nI send it all over the world\nIt's all I can bare\nAnd the nights get long\nBut my heart holds on\nIt's no empty words\nIt's my own silent message to you\nTakes me there, my lover's prayer\nAnd my soul is divided in two\n'Cause I can't let go\nAnd my heart has a mind of it's own\nIt's my lover's prayer"
