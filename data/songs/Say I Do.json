I am now\n[Chorus]\nSay I do, I do, I do\nIf you really love me\nSay I do, I do, I do\nIf you want to be with me\nSay I do, I do, I do\n'Cause I really want to be with you, oh oh\nSay I do, I do, I do\n[Bridge]\nOh baby, my lady\nI can't wait to give you my heart\nMy lady, sweet lady\nGive me your hand in love, love, love\nOh baby I\n\n[Chorus]\nSay I do, I do, I do\nOh, oh, oh\nSay I do, I do, I do\n'Cause I really want to be with you, girl\nSay I do, I do, I do\n[Outro]\nIf you want me girl like I want you\nWhy don't you \nsay I do, I do, I do\nIf you need me girl like I need you\nWhy don't you \nsay I do, I do, I do\nSurrender\nForever\nSay I do, I do, I do\nForever\nSay I do, I do, I do\nKnow that I care\nSay I do, I do, I do\nSay it, baby, tonight\nSay I do, I do, I do\nSay the word, say the words"
