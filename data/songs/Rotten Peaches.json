Marie\nAnd I've always had trouble wherever I've settled\nRotten peaches are all that I see\n[Chorus]\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\nSeems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun\nMercy, I'm a criminal, Jesus, I'm the one\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\n(Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun)\n(Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun)\nMercy, I'm a criminal, Jesus, I'm the one\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\n[Verse 3]\nThere ain't no green grass in a U.S. state prison\nThere is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife\nAnd each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches\nYou'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh, I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills\nFor I lie in the light of the Lord\nAnd my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away\nAnd I guess I won't see it no more\n[Chorus]\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\nSeems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun\nMercy, I'm a criminal, Jesus, I'm the one\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\nSeems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun\nMercy, I'm a criminal\nJesus, I'm the, Jesus, I'm the one\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\nRotten peaches, rotting in the sun\n[Instrumental Outro]\n[Vocal Harmonies]"
