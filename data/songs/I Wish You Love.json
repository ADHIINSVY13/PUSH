  "lyrics": "Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends\nNever lovers ever friends\nGoodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away\nI sincerely want to say\nI wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing\nAnd then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love\nAnd in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade\nI wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love\nMy breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be\nSo with my best, my very best, I set you free\nI wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm\nBut, most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love\n(musical interlude)\nI wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm\nMost of all, when snowflakes fall, hot damn, I wish you love\nAll kinds of love, a whole gang of love"
