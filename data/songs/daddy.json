(Oh yeah)\nDo it girl, I don't wanna get it (Oh yeah)\nWhy yo' neck always on a million (Oh yeah)\nPop two then I won't feel it (Oh yeah)\n[Chorus: Billie Eilish]\nDaddy said stop coming around\nYou just can't stop runnin' your mouth\nYour pretty, your pretty mouth\nYou're pretty bad, boy\nYou're pretty bad, boy\nMake me cry, make me [?]\nYou make me sad, boy\nNow look who's sad, daddy\n\n[Verse: Billie Eilish]\nI'm breaking up and down\nI'm climbing up the walls\nI swear I'd rather drown than pick up when you call\n'Cause we don't really talk\nI cry and you console\nBut you can't make me stop\n'Cause I won't take control\nYou got me on all fours, the only play I role\nThere's nothing I love more than doing what I'm told\nI do what I'm told\nTell me what to do\nTell me what to do\nTell me what to do, daddy\nDaddy"
