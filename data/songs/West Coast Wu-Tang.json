Tell the medics it's okay\nA beast when the beat break\nYou probably think I'm dope, like this the realest shit I wrote\nBut to me, it's a throw-away\nI stare at the four walls and rap like I'm mad at God\nNice enough to throw a spear at Nas\nLaunch at Jay, matter fact, let me take that back\nSee, I don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do\nI'm crucial, concealed by real Crips and Suwoo\nAnd they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nIs it real, son? Is it really real, son?\nIs it really real, son? Is it really real?\nTell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son\nTell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel\nYou rappers got nothing for me when Soun-Sounwave record me\nEvery MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nCome again, no introduction, you know my name\nSoul brother, deuces suck the juice from my ding-a-ling\nOrangutan arms, banging niggas like a set\nWhen I speak, they fucking silent, like sex for the deaf\nViolence, I play it like violins\nIn the orchestra, treat you like vitamins\nThen spit you back out\nLike a verse I had way back before I had it mapped out\nRip a page out the Almanac, then cross reference when I wreck shit\nI wish jaw bone fractures on all of you rappers bumping your gums\nLike the measles when the record meets the needle\nHeads spinning like a 12-inch, \nSmoking the best Celtic\nLike I shot Larry Bird, follow my word\nBig Herb\n, ill with it, I need a hospital gown\nYou need 54 cards, deal with it\nYou may think I'm killing it, but I'm healing it\nLike a bitch in the club' shoe game – touché\n\n[Verse 3: Punch]\nAy yo yo, the flow potent\nWho's more focused? Kick doors open\nDeliver the golden opus, leave with two guns smoking\nIt's me, the podium closing, a poet well-spoken\nThe gropes is most consistent with imminent penmanship\nMind-bending, co-existing with the written\nVerbal assassin, internally smashing\nSpazzing on tracks – translation: I'm disgusting in action\nA lyrical glutton busting over Sounwave productions\nY'all don't want nothing\nThe sum of all fears\nMercury rising, I'm summer all year\nI sixteen 'em to death and wish them the best\nI guess that's the gift and a curse, you see my pattering\nY'all still rapping like that's what's happening\nI write rhymes with fire on stone tablets, peep the malice\nI'm a monster, ya Boy running like William Joseph Crawford\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nIs it real, son? Is it really real, son?\nIs it really real, son? Is it really real?\nTell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son\nTell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel\nYou rappers got nothing for me when Soun-Sounwave record me\nEvery MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nStraight up\nDon't get ate up\nPut rappers in quicksand\nDot leaned on 'em like kickstands\nI'm so hot, kids put me in their iPod\nEven atheists play my shit and say, \"My God\nJesus, Joseph, and Mary, he's nice\" – don't compare me to them\nJust compare me to Mike Jordan\nWhen I record and the verse and the chorus is ill\nYou can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa\nWatch I lay-up, bar after bar, like I'm trying to build a gate up\nSee me on the way up, like an elevator\nI'ma let you take the stairs\nThat metaphor meaning I'm already there (Greatness)\nI'm in the booth with an apron\nCooking up shit like Martha Stewart was my bitch – amen\nStay on the curb like a spray paint can\nBlowing herb with my nigga Herb\nFuck what you niggas heard\nWe the new West Coast Wu-Tang, bitch\nAnd I'm the best, think less? You can suck my dick\nWho from the West can kill it like us? Give me their name\nNow I take 'em to the house of pain\nTop Dawg headquarters\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nIs it real, son? Is it really real, son?\nIs it really real, son? Is it really real?\nTell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son\nTell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel\nYou rappers got nothing for me when Soun-Sounwave record me\nEvery MC, I'm sure to rip them, I guarantee you will forgive them"
