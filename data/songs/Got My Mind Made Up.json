  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Daz]\nYou find a MC like me who's strong\nLeavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support\nAnd when I command the microphone\nI get deadly as Khan, though\nWith a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those\nWho can withstand the more power I gain?\nThat make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo' brain\nImagine and keep on wishin' upon a star\nFinally realizin' who the fuck we are\nWhen I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded\nWould it be the greatest MC of all-time? When I created rhyme\nFor the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride\nOur intention to ride, every time, all night\nI'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar\nFor me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride\nBreakin' in gas with a .68 all day\nIn-and-out with my pay, assume to count the bodies\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nSo mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation\nSo you could be more familiar with the nigga you facin'\nWe must be patient, nothin' better than communication\nKnown to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations\nSorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination\nGive up to fate, and get that ass shakin'\nI'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic\nDon't take your life for granted\nPut that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted\nMy lyrics motivate the planet\nIt's similar to \"Rhythm Nation\", but thugged out, forgive me, Janet\nWho's in control? I'm activatin' your souls\nYou know the way the games gettin' told\nYo, two years ago, a friend of mine\nTold me Aliz√© and Cristal blows your mind\nBear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote\nTakin' off my coat, clearin' my throat\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nI got my mind made up, come on (Come on)\nGet in, get into it (Get on it)\nLet it ride (Get with it), tonight's the night\nI got my mind made up, come on\nGet in, get into it (To it)\nLet it ride, tonight's the night\n[Verse 3: Kurupt]\nWell, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylac's\nFor protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse (Uh)\n'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays\nSendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave\nI wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs\nShows my heart's as cold as the tundra\nElectrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much\nRough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch\nI'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay\nYou got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei\nMy rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind\nAs the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm\nThere's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'\nI use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'\nOpposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain\nLaughter enhances the chances of the killin'\nWhy is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive\nYou best believe, to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease\nMy thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe\nYour whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees\n (Uh)\nIn the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics\nMy verbal snipe your vocab on site\nI'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all\nSo all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall (Yeah)\nShould already have an idea about the superior sphere\nThe greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator (Equation)\nI rock from here to there, to Philly and back\nTo L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust like straps\nAs your views get overshadowed when you come in contact\nBeware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat\n\n[Verse 4: Method Man]\nFuck you losers\nWhile you fake jacks, I make maneuvers\nLike Hitler stickin' up **** with German ****\nThe mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle\nWill be back after this message, don't touch the dial (Yeah)\nRarely do you see an MC out for justice\nGot my gun powder and my musket, blaow\nMelons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan\nHalf of my clans repeat felons\nNiggas best protect they joints for nine-nickels\nMan, I stay on point like icicles\nNow, who wanna test \nTical\n, then tes-ticles\nAll up in your motherfuckin' mouth\nHeadbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie\nMethod Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me\nBetter take one and pass or that's that ass\nYour vital statistics are low and fallin' fast\nJohnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash\nPlay a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast\n[Verse 5: Redman]\nAyo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics\nNon-believers get my dick and genital backwards\nLet's face it, there's no replacement\nTaste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with\nAvalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted\nFunk Doctor, who? Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted\nI got connects like Federal Express\nTo get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch\nGot the clear spot from the rear block\nTo bust 'til every nigga \nhere\n drop, men, I fear not\nHold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop\nSince your crew suit you to shift\nNow, you claim that your gears locked\nWhiff this underground cannabis\nI'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst\nFlip MCs like ki's\nMy degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs\nLick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake\nSo I erase the whole front row at the wake\nI planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake\nBust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place\nConfidence for you shaky-ass folks\nPump for Rockafella for the day he got smoke\nChoke off this antidote, got you hope\nGet roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt\n(And I'm out for nine-nickel)\n\n[Outro: Inspectah Deck]\nI-N-S the Rebel\nWist, bliss, this\nSis', bliss"
