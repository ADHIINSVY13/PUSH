  "lyrics": "When I was young I dreamed of you\nFar and away, my dreams come true\nNow I know what love has done\nChildren of mine, we all are one\nWhen I was young I looked to you\nYou were the world I never knew\nThrough the years we all have grown\nKnowing your love forever strong\nWould you walk away if I raised my voice?\nDo you think I taught you well?\nTime after time after time\nIn younger days I felt for you\nWith all the pain that we went through\nWe believe the one above\nFather and Son, forever love\nHand in hand, the future's here\nNow that we crossed the bridge of tears\nFinding truth and facing fears\nWe can walk on, the road is clear\nWalk across the bridge\nTake my hand\nWalk across the bridge\nCome to me\n\nWould you walk away if I raised my voice?\nDo you think I taught you well?\nTime after time after time\nWalk across the bridge\nCome to me\nWalk across the bridge\nYou'll never be far away\nYou'll never be far away\nYou'll never be far away"
