  "lyrics": "[Spoken]\nWho studies honesty with wilder gaze,\nWhile through its oddity must wings take flight?\nThrough alchemy the artist's mind a maze,\nA labyrinth of souls make joy and plight.\nAdmired by all faithful to their craft,\nMy gasp is quick, imagining we're free.\nSo, like the way all children learn to laugh,\nSo effortlessly I have love for thee.\nIf fantasy could surely make a friend,\nThe palette of your dreams would draw them mad—\nBeyond the universe—you know no end,\nWhilst some still search for color never had.\nThis life is only art on life support.\nAnd nature is a knight—no king or court."
