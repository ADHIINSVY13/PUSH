nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unit\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nI blast, 50 Cent nigga that's what's up\n[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks & \n50 Cent\n]\nRight now my life movin' too fast to stop and pray\nSee every now and then I smile just not today\nIn my hood they let the choppers spray\nSomebody probably got shot today\nI name don' pop when niggas surfboard\nYou ain't stoppin' me dawg\nOnly time you left ya hood is on Monopoly boards\n \n(Yea)\nI'm grimy as birds shittin on the top of ya ford\nYou will, die by the gun if you ain't droppin ya sword\nI got tattoos as well as lead marks\nTo me \n(Woo)\n fucking is kinda like racin and I always get a head start\nMy opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC\nJust yesterday guns is blastin with red darts, beef, you a target\nCause when we come at yo ass, Aladdin won't be the only one the carpet,\n man you wanna play wit a ringer?\nI ain't a peoples person, I give my next door neighbor the finger (Fuck you)\nEven though I got the shit in the stores, I'm like a nigga that borrow clothes\nBitch, I'm tryna get in ya draws, man, I dump a whole clip in ya mans braids\nPussies love Nelly, he made it look cool to wear Band-Aids \n(Ha ha ha)\nI'm blowin on damn haze\nAll of a sudden I'm gassed, 'cause I'm on the radio and I can't wave\nIf you ain't up on thangs\nLloyd Banks is the name, G-Unit's the gang\nNow I know to keep low when the heat blow\nI have niggas post up on ya block like I'm shootin the free throw\nStill get the green from P-dro, better known as Pedro\nI'm ghetto like a patty or egg-roll\nYea they feinin to stick me, they don't know the ninas is wit me, snuck in wit Christina and Britney\nY'all only spend time at the mall\nOn New Years eve a body drops around the same time as the ball \n(Yea)\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unit\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unit\nG-Unit (That's what's up), G-Unittttttt\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nKeep thinkin I'm candy\nAin't nuttin' sweet about me\nNigaas talkin' in the pens, in the street about me (Wooo!)\nSome Jake, tryna watch every move I make\nCause my diesel'll make fiends do the up-town shake,\n \nI'm a pro\nI'm far from a amateur, holdin' more keys than your fuckin' janitor\nThey say \"God bless the child that could hold his own\"\nYou pay cops to hold you down, I just hold the chrome (Woo)\nEvery breath I take\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make, I got a ruger on my hip\nYou ain't gotta like or love me but you gon' respect me\nYou need a fifth and two clips to try and check me\n12 in the afternoon we can start the clappin' (Goddamn)\nLook homie I'm down for that daytime action\nKeep thinkin' it's a game till I'm in front of ya home\nGet the drop on that ass and shot shatter ya bones (Yea!)\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & \nTony Yayo\n]\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unit\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga that's what's up\nG-Unit, \n(Yea)\n G-Unittttttt\nG-Unit nigga \n(Uh)\n that's \n(Uh)\n what's up \n(Geah, uh, yea)\nG-Unit, G-Unit (Front, I blast ya up)\nG-Unit, G-Unittttttt\n[Verse 3: Tony Yayo & \n50 Cent\n, \nBoth\n]\nListen boy, Tony be the real McCoy \n(Uh huh)\nWhen hoes see the new toy, they jump for joy  \n(Yea!)\nAnd even though the kid rappin'\nI still got fiends in the hood puffin' on that \nMagic Dragon\n \n(Wooo!)\nMy guns under my pillow, I sleep wit my \nshoes on\nEvery single night me and my mac get \nour groove on\nDon't get moved on\nCause I shoot through your biceps your triceps then breeze through ya projects\nWhen the coke come back\nIt's the China White\nAnd the D don't sweat us in a bag of rice\nLet's ride OT \n([?] ya self)\nAnd burn the tape\nI got this bad mommy, her mouth's a sperm bank\nSince Yayo be a fearless man\nI donate my heart to them niggas that ran\nAnd, the niggas in the hood don't wanna see me famous\nThey rather see my mom's make funeral arrangements\nI got enough rhymes, to fill six notebooks\nI been spittin' that shit ever since cold crush\nYou can hear me on your T.V. and radio at the same time\nI never ever say the same rhyme,\n \nit's Tony two times\nBeware of my wrath, I'm gon' school you niggas\nPrepare for class\nYo, I peep where your funds at, peep where you pumped that\nMoney you tryna stack, I spent that on blunt wraps\n\n[Outro: Bang Em Smurf]\nWord to my mother nigga 50 fuckin' Cent nigga (G-Unit nigga)\nG-Unit nigga\nWe about to gorrilla this industry' man\nY'all niggas better know\nY'all niggas better fear us nigga\nWord to my mother nigga\nFuck y'all niggas wanna do\n134 nigga, G-Unit\n50 Cent, Tony Yayo\nLloyd Banks nigga\nBllllatttt\nPop off"
