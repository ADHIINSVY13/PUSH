South Coast slums\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\n\n[Verse 2: André 3000]\nThis ol' sucka MC stepped up to me\nChallenged André to a battle and I stood there patiently\nAs he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling\nWhole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding\nI say, \"Look, boy, I ain't for that fuck shit—so fuck this\"\n\"Let me explain 'only child' style so you don't dis'\"\nI grew up to myself not round no park bench\nJust a nigga busting flows off in apartments\n[Hook: André 3000 & \nPeaches\n]\nNow who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion\nThis side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing\nBut in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs\nAsking where we come from? South  Coast slums\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\nIt's just two dope boys in a cadillac\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nIt goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods\n, \nCoupes to De Villes\nHitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill\nIn this atmosphere this ain't no practice here\nWe cutting the fool now\nI'm doing you at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now\nDon't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead\nLooking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted\nFainted when you heard the burban serving on the block\nAnd all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop\n\n[Verse 4: André 3000]\nYeah, tight like nuts and bolts,\n \nsluts and hoes they get evicted\nI'm dealing wit Queens in my castle—ain't worth it to risk it\nNow tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects\nCan't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex\nOr no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying \"We'll rap for food\"\nMy face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood\nWhile my partner got the squeegee and the Windex\n'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error\nBring the terror to your dome like PE\nProne to finish this out because this be a freestyle\n[Hook: André 3000]\nNow who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?\nThis side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'\nBut in the middle we stay calm\nWe just drop–\n(Explosion)"
