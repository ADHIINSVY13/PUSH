  "lyrics": "I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate\nWe'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake\nMy set is amazing, it even smells like a street\nThere's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend\nSomeone scrawled on the walls \"I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses\"\nWho wrote up scandals in other bars\nI'm having so much fun with the poisonous people\nSpreading rumours and lies and stories they made up\nSome make you sing and some make you scream\nOne makes you wish that you'd never been seen\nBut there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier-mâché\nMaking bullet-proof faces;\n \nCharlie Manson,\n \nCassius Clay\nIf you want it, boys, get it here, thing\nSo you scream out of line:\n\"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?\"\nTres butch little number whines \"Hey dirty, I want you\nWhen it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces\"\nIf you want it, boys, get it here, thing\nWell, on the street where you live\nI could not hold up my head\nFor I put all I have in another bed\nOn another floor, in the back of a car\nIn a cellar like a church with the door ajar\nWell, I guess we must be looking for a different kind\nBut we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds\n'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights\nWho press you on the \nground\n while shaking in fright\nI guess we could cruise down one more time\nWith you by my side, it should be fine\nWe'll buy some drugs and watch a band\nThen jump in the river holding hands"
