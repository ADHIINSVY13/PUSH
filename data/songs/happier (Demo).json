  "lyrics": "Picking her apart\nLike cutting her down will make you miss my wretched heart\nBut she's beautiful\nShe looks kind\nShe probably gives you butterflies\nI hope you're happy\nBut not like how you were with me\nI'm selfish, I know\nI can't let you go\nSo find someone great, but don't find no one better\nI hope you're happy, but don't be happier"
