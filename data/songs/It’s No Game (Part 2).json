  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSilhouettes and shadows\nWatch the revolution\nNo more free steps to heaven\nJust walkie-talkie\nHeaven or hearth\nJust big heads and drums\nFull speed and pagan\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's no game\n[Verse 2]\nI am barred\nFrom the event\nI really don't understand the situation\nSo where's the moral?\nPeople have their fingers broken\nTo be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's no game\n[Bridge]\nDocumentaries on refugees\nCouples 'gainst the target\nThrow a rock against the road\nAnd it breaks into pieces\nDraw the blinds on yesterday\nAnd it's all so much scarier\nPut a bullet in my brain\nAnd it makes all the papers\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's no game\n[Verse 3]\nChildren round the world\nPut camel shit on the walls\nThey're making carpets on treadmills\nOr garbage sorting\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's no game"
