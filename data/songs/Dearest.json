The Lord took you away\nAnd if you could see my today, I will remember you\nI will remember you\nMy dearest, sincerest\nThere's no one but you and\nHere in my heart you're my dearest too\nWhere do I go from here? The Lord took you away\nAnd if you could see me today, I will remember you\nI will remember you\nMy dearest, sincerest\nThere's no one but you and\nHere in my heart you're my dearest too"
