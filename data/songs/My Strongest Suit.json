Wit? I am a doubter\nManners? Charm? They're no way to impress\nSo forget the inner me, observe the outer\nI am what I wear and how I dress\nOh, now I believe in lookin'\nLike my time on earth is cookin'\nWhether polka dotted, striped or even checked\nWith some glamour guaranteeing\nEvery fiber on of my being\nIs displayed to quite remarkable effect\nFrom your cradle via trousseau\nTo your deathbed you're on view, so\nNever compromise, accept no substitute\nI would rather wear a barrel\nThan conservative apparel\nFor my dress has always been...my strongest suit\n(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)\n\nStaying in or hitting town-wards\nFrom the top and working downwards\nI ensure that every stitch is stitched in time (Is stitched in time)\nWhether wig or hat or turban\nWhether clad boudoir or urban\nNot to strut your stuff outrageously is a crime (It's such a crime)\nAnd the few who are invited (Overwear)\nTo my wardrobe are delighted (Underwear)\nAs they wander through my things (Anytime)\nTo find en route (We're wandering through your things)\nThat in negligee or formal (Negligee)\nI am anything but normal (Anything but normal)\nAnd dress has always been my strongest suit\n(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)\n(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)\nI am what I wear\n(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)\nI said anytime...\n(Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere)\nAnywhere\nSo bring me all my finest (Finest)\nMost audacious, my divinest (Divinest)\nMost revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)\n(Most arresting) Most arresting\n(Most heartstopping) Most heartstopping\nMost free-flowing (Overwear)\nMost eye-popping (Underwear)\nMost arresting (Anytime)\nMost heartstopping, yeah (Anywhere)\nDress has always been my strongest suit!\n\n(I am what I wear)\nMy strongest suit\n(I am what I wear)\nYou know that I am what I wear\n(I am what I wear)\nDress has always been my strongest suit!\nSo bring me all my finest (My finest)\nMost audacious, my divinest (Divinest)\nMost revealing, most expensive and to boot (Most revealing, most expensive)\nMost arresting, most heartstopping\nMost free-flowing, most eye-popping\nDress has always been my strongest suit!\n(I am what I wear)\nMy strongest suit\n(I am what I wear)\nYou know that I am what I wear\nDress has always been my strongest\nMy strongest, my strongest\nMy strongest, my strongest\nMy strongest suit!"
