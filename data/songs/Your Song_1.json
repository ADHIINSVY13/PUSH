  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's a little bit funny, this feeling inside\nI'm not one of those who can easily hide\nI don't have much money, but boy if I did\nI'd buy a big house where we both could live\n[Verse 2]\nIf I was a sculptor, but, but then again, no\nOr a woman who makes potions on a traveling show\nI know it's not much, but it's the best I can do\nMy gift is my song, and this one's for you\n[Chorus]\nAnd you can tell everybody this is your song\nIt may be quite simple, but now that it's done\nI hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind\nThat I put down in words\nHow wonderful life is now you're in the world (Ooh hoo)\n[Verse 3]\nI sat on the roof and kicked off the moss\nWell, a few of these verses, well, they've got me quite cross\nBut the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song\nIt's for people like you that keep it turned on\n[Verse 4]\nSo excuse me forgetting, these things I do\nYou see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue\nWell anyway, the thing is, what I really mean\nIt's yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you can tell everybody this is your song\nIt may be quite simple, but now that it's done\nI hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind\nThat I put down in words\nHow wonderful life is now you're in the world\n[Outro]\nI hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind\nThat I put down in words\nHow wonderful life is now you're in, you're in, you're in, you're in the world\nAh"
