Reid, yeah, he pays me\nAnd it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets\nAnd all that other fat stuff like that, yeah\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nYou got to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high, high\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\nThat's why\n[Verse 4: André 3000]\nY'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?\nAin't nobody black running but crac-kers, so, why\nI got to register? I thinking of better stuff to do with my time\nNever smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep-est rhymes\nSo let me take y'all way\nBack to whipping dammies in Southwest Atlanta, ayy\nY'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock\nAt age 13, start working at the loading dock\nThey laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping\nBut I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping\nDoing dumb things, not knowing what I... know now\nYeah, that petty stuff will have you cased up and locked down\nI dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool\nWasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool\nCool is how I played the tenth grade\nI thought it was all about macking goods and wearing pimp fade\nInstead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some, in some\nNot thinking about them six courses that I need to pass\nGraduation rolled around like rolly-pollies\nDamn, that's messed up, I should've listened when my mama told me\nThat, if you play now, you gonna suffer later\nFigured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention\nAnd kept missing the point she tried to poke me with\nThe doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit\nHuh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast\nSo get up off your ass\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nDon't spend all your time tryna get high\nYou need git up, git out and git something\nHow will you make it if you never even try?\nYou need to git up, git out and git something\nCause you and I got to do for you and I\n[Outro: Cee-Lo]\nYou need to...\nYou need to...\nYou need to...\nYou need to..."
