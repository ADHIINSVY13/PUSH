Lovecraft\nYour Edgar Allan Poe\nYou got your unkind of ravens\nAnd your murder of crows\nCatty eyelashes\nAnd your Dracula cape\nBeen flashing triple-A passes\nAt the cemetery gates\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you're so dark, babe\nBut I want you hard\nYou're so dark, baby\n[Refrain]\nYou're so dark\nYou're so dark\nYou're so dark\nYou're so dark\n[Verse 2]\nAnd you're so mysterious\nGot that obsession with death\nI saw you driving your Prius\nAnd even that was Munster Koach-esque\nYou watch Italian horror\nAnd you listen to the scores\nLeather-cladded, spike collared\nI want you down on all fours\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you're so dark, babe\nBut I want you hard\nYou're so dark, baby\n[Bridge]\nI know you're nothing like mine\n'Cause she's walking on sunshine\nAnd your love would tear us apart\nAnd I know I'm not your type\n'Cause I don't shun the daylight\nBut, baby, I'm willing to start\n[Refrain]\nYou're so dark\n[Verse 3]\nGot your H.P. Lovecraft\nYour Edgar Allen Poe\nGot your unkind of ravens\nGot your murder of crows\n[Chorus]\nYou're so dark, babe\nBut I want you hard\nYou're so dark, baby\nBut I want you hard\nYou're so dark, oh\nBut I want you hard\nYou're so dark, baby"
