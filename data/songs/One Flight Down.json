  "lyrics": "One flight down\nThere's a song on low\nAnd your mind just picked up on the sound\nNow you know you're wrong\nBecause it drifts like smoke\nAnd it's been there playing all along\nNow you know\nNow you know\nThe reeds and brass have been weaving\nLeading into a single note\nIn this place\nWhere your arms unfold\nHere at last you see your ancient face\nNow you know\nNow you know\nThe cadence rolls in broken\nPlays it over and then goes\nOne flight down\nThere's a song on low\nAnd it's been there playing all along\nNow you know\nNow you know"
