  "lyrics": "Originally written by Bob Dylan. Dylan wrote this songs to call out american leaders and officials during the cold war.\n[Verse 1]\nCome ye masters of war\nYou that build the big guns\nYou that build the death planes\nYou that build all the bombs\nYou that hide behind walls\nYou that hide behind desks\nI just want you to know\nI can see through your masks\n[Verse 2]\nYou that never done nothin'\nBut build to destroy\nYou play with my world\nLike it’s your little toy\nPut a gun in my hands\nAnd you hide from my eyes\nAnd you turn and run farther\nAs the fast bullets fly\n[Verse 3]\nLike Judas of old\nYou lie and deceive\nA war can be won\nYou want me to believe\nBut I see through your eyes\nAnd I see through your brain\nLike I see through the water\nThat runs down my drain\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou fasten all the triggers\nFor the others to fire\nThen you sit back and watch\nAs the death count gets high\nAnd you hide in your mansion\nWhile the young people’s blood\nFlows out of their bodies\nAnd is buried in the mud\n[Verse 5]\nAnd you’ve thrown the worst fear\nThat can ever be hurled\nFear to bring children\nInto the world\nFor threatening my baby\nUnborn and unnamed\nWell, you ain't worth the blood\nThat runs in your veins\n[Verse 6]\nHow much do I know\nTo talk out of turn\nYou might say that I’m young\nYou might say I’m unlearned\nBut there’s one thing I know\nThough I’m younger than you\nEven Jesus would never\nForgive what you do\n\n[Verse 7]\nLet me ask you one question\nIs your money that good?\nWill it buy you forgiveness\nDo you think that it could?\nWell, I think you will find\nWhen your death takes its toll\nAll the money you made\nWill never buy back your soul\n[Verse 8]\nAnd I hope that you die\nAnd your death'll come soon\nAnd I'll follow your casket\nIn the pale afternoon\nAnd I’ll watch as you’re lowered\nDown to your deathbed\nAnd I’ll stand over your grave\nTo make sure that you’re dead\n[Outro]\nCool\nHe's an intense guy, isn't he?"
