  "lyrics": "She walks like an angel walks\nShe talks like an angel talks\nAnd her hair has a kind of curl\nTo my mind, she's my kind of girl\nShe's wise like an angel's wise\nWith eyes like an angel's eyes\nAnd a smile like a kind of pearl\nTo my mind, she's my kind of girl\nA pretty little face\nThat face just knocks me off my feet\nA pretty little feet\nShe's really sweet enough to eat\nShe looks like an angel looks\nShe cooks like an angel cooks\nAnd my mind's in a kind of whirl\nTo my mind, she's my kind of girl\n(full instrumental interlude)\nHmmm, pretty little face\nThat face just knocks me off my feet\nPretty little feet\nShe's really sweet enough to eat\n\nShe looks like an angel looks\nAnd she cooks like an angel cooks\nAnd my mind's in a kind of whirl\nTo my mind, she's my kind of girl\nYes, my poor heart's in a whirl\nShe's just my kind, she's a girl\nAnd I'm glad"
