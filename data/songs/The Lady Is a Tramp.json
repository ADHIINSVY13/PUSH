  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe gets too hungry for dinner at eight\nShe likes the theatre and never comes late\nShe never bothers with people she'd hate\nThat's why the lady is a tramp\n[Verse 2]\nDoesn't like crap games with barons or earls\nWon't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls\nWon't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls\nThat's why the lady is a tramp\n[Verse 3]\nShe likes the free, fresh wind in her hair, life without care\nShe's broke and it's oke'\nHates California, it's cold and it's damp\nThat's why the lady is a tramp\n[Verse 1]\nShe gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight\nShe loves the theatre, but never comes late\nShe'd never bother with people she'd hate\nThat's why the lady is a tramp\n[Verse 4]\nShe'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds\nAnd she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords\nAnd she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads\nThat's why the lady is a tramp\n\n[Outro]\nShe loves the free fresh wind in her hair, life without care\nShe's broke, but it's oke'\nHates California, it's so cold and so damp\nThat's why the lady, that's why the lady\nThat's why the lady is a tramp"
