Justin Bieber’s song about his alleged “baby mama” is an electronic mixture of “Billie Jean” and shots at the obsessive fan.\n[Intro: Matt Lauer & \nJustin Bieber\n]\nJustin Bieber\nPop star Justin Bieber\nDenied he fathered a child\nThere is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that\nYeah\nThere is also a pretty white hot spotlight\nOf course\nAnd you found yourself under it recently, some headlines\nTo set the record straight, none of it is true\nDo you know this woman?\nNever met the woman, so\nNo? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh\nExactly\nLife in the fast lane, as they say\n[Verse 1]\nShe said she met me on the tour\nShe keeps knockin' on my door\nShe won't leave me, leave me alone\nThis girl, she wouldn't stop\nAlmost had to call the cops\nShe was schemin', ooh, she was wrong\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause she wanted all my attention (Hey)\nAnd she was dragging my name through the dirt\n (Oh)\nShe was dying for my affection\nBut she got mad 'cause I didn’t give it to her\n (I'm talking to you)\n\n[Chorus]\nMaria, why you wanna do me like that?\nThat ain't my baby\n (No), \nthat ain't my girl\nMaria, why you wanna play me like that?\nShe ain't my baby\n (No), \nshe ain't my girl\n'Cause she's talking it and she needs to quit\n'Cause I never hit, so I know she's not mine\nThat ain't my baby\n (That's not my baby), \nthat ain't my girl\n (No)\nAnd she wilding out, what she talkin' 'bout?\nLet me tell you now, this girl, she's not mine\nShe ain't my baby, she ain't my girl\n[Verse 2]\nNow she's in the magazines\nOn TV making a scene\nOh, she's crazy, crazy in love\nAnd she's all over the news\nSaying everything but the truth\nShe's faking, faking it all\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause she wanted all my attention (Hey)\nAnd she was dragging my name through the dirt\n (Oh)\nShe was dying for my affection\nBut she got mad cause I didn’t give it to her\n (I'm talking to you)\n\n[Chorus]\nMaria, why you wanna do me like that?\nThat ain't my baby\n (No), \nthat ain't my girl\nMaria, why you wanna play me like that?\nShe ain't my baby\n (No), \nshe ain't my girl\n'Cause she's talking it and she needs to quit\n'Cause I never hit, so I know she's not mine\nThat ain't my baby\n (That's not my baby), \nthat ain't my girl\n (No)\nAnd she wilding out, what she talkin' 'bout?\nLet me tell you now, this girl, she's not mine\nShe ain't my baby, she ain't my girl\n[Bridge]\nWhy are you trying, trying to lie, girl?\nWhen I ain't never met you at all\nSaying goodbye\n, but how could ya\nYou do this, you prove this\nYour foolness, seduces\nMaria, why you wanna do me like that?\nThat ain't my baby\n (No), \nthat ain't my girl\nMaria, why you wanna play me like that?\nShe ain't my baby\n (No), \nshe ain't my girl\n[Chorus]\n'Cause she's talking it and she needs to quit\n'Cause I never hit, so I know she's not mine\nThat ain't my baby\n (That's not my baby), \nthat ain't my girl\n (No)\nAnd she wilding out, what she talkin' 'bout?\nLet me tell you now, this girl, she's not mine\nShe ain't my baby\n (This not my baby), \nshe ain't my girl\n (No)\n\n[Outro]\nThat ain't my baby\n (That ain’t my baby), \nthat ain't my girl\nShe ain't my baby\n (She ain’t my baby, yeah), \nshe ain't my girl\nShe ain't my baby, she ain't my girl\n, yeah\nShe ain't my baby\n, she's not my girl"
