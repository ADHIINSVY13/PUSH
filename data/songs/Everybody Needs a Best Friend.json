  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy words are lazy\nMy thoughts are hazy\nBut this is one thing I'm sure of\nEverybody needs a best friend\nI'm happy I'm yours\n[Verse 2]\nYou've got a double who brings you trouble\nAnd though you're better without me\nEverybody needs a best friend\nI'm happy I'm yours\n[Bridge]\nA fool could see decidedly\nThat you're a 10 and I'm a 3\nA royal breed is what you need\nSo how do you come to be stuck with a bummer like me?\n[Refrain]\nYou've got a head full\nOf someone dreadful\nBut having someone adore you\nEverybody needs a best friend\nI'm happy I'm yours\n\n[Bridge]\nA fool could see decidedly\nThat you're a 10 and I'm a 3\nA royal breed is what you need\nSo how do you come to be stuck with a bummer like me?\n[Refrain]\nOh, you've got a head full of someone dreadful\nAnd yet alas, that someone adores you\nEverybody needs a best friend\nI'm happy I'm yours\n[Outro]\nI'm just a clown\nAnd I'll bring you down\nBut you just don't care, cause your\nBest friend is me"
