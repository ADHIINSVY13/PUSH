It is featured in the “Holiday Special” episode.\n[Verse 1]\nComin' on Christmas\nThey're cuttin' down trees\nThey're puttin' up reindeer\nAnd singin' songs of joy and peace\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on\n[Verse 2]\nBut it don't snow here\nIt stays pretty green\nI'm gonna make a lotta money\nThen I'm gonna quit this crazy scene\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on\n[Chorus]\nI wish I had a river so long\nI would teach my feet to fly\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on\nI made my baby cry\n[Verse 3]\nHe tried hard to help me\nYou know, he put me at ease\nAnd he loved me so naughty\nMade me weak in the knees\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on\n\n[Verse 4]\nI'm so hard to handle\nI'm selfish and I'm sad\nAnd now I've gone and lost the best baby\nThat I ever had\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on\n[Chorus]\nI wish I had a river so long\nI would teach my feet to fly\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on\nI made my baby say goodbye\n[Verse 5]\nIt's comin' on Christmas\nThey're cuttin' down trees\nThey're puttin' up reindeer\nAnd singin' songs of joy and peace\nOh, I wish I had a river\nI could skate away on"
