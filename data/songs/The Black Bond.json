When we all know you pumpkin pie\nWhen we in the bus, we fly better shit than Emirates\nTo Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict\nHeaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out\nYou are what a thug about, I'm a fucking juggernaut\nNever sleep, never tire\n, keep a freak I tie up\nWho don't speak, she quiet\nSo I can think, conspire\nOn my feet's are tires, and sometimes sneakers\nWear ties at the Setai Miami\nTime-pieces are from Zurich\nIt's like I'm allergic, to Nonoxynol 9\nGive it to you raw so you can feel it"
