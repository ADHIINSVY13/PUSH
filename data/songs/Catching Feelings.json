It sounds similar to his previous single “Only Thing I Ever Get for Christmas”\n[Verse 1]\nSun comes up on another morning\nMy mind never wakes up without you on it\nAnd it's crazy to me\nI even see you in my dreams\nIs this meant to be?\nCould this be happening to me? Yeah\nWe were best of friends since we were this high\nSo why do I get nervous every time you walk by?\nWe would be on the phone all day\nNow I can't find the words to say to you\nNow what am I supposed to do?\n[Chorus]\nCould it be a possibility?\nI'm tryna see what's up\nIt's been me for you, and you for me\nMaybe now it's time for us\nTryna keep it all together, but enough is enough\nThey say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\nCatching feelings, girl\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n[Verse 2]\nIn my head, we're already together\nI'm good alone, but with you, I'm better\nI just wanna see you smile (See you smile)\nJust say the word and I'll be right there (Be right there)\nI ain't never goin' nowhere\nI'm just tryna see where this can take us\n'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious\nI think I finally got it down\nAnd all that's left to do now is get out the mirror\nAnd say it to her, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nCould it be a possibility?\nI'm tryna see what's up\nIt's been me for you, and you for me\nMaybe now it's time for us\nTryna keep it all together, but enough is enough\nThey say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\nCatching feelings, girl\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n[Bridge]\nShould I tell her how I really feel? (How I really feel)\nOr should I move in closer? Just be still? (How will I know?)\n'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?\nHow do I know if she feels the same? Whoa, ooh-ooh\n[Chorus]\nCould it be a possibility?\nI'm tryna see what's up (What's up?)\nIt's been me for you (Me for you), and you for me (You for me)\nMaybe now is time for us\nTryna keep it all together, but enough is enough\nThey say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\nCatching feelings, girl\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n[Outro]\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\nCatching feelings\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\nCatching feelings\nCatching feelings"
