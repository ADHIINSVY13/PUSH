  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSank into their calculations\nAnd snorted on a stench\nOf their arithmetic\nLook for the boy who was hanging his head low\nMore trophies and ideas\nTo follow their pretend\n[Chorus]\nWith a scowl in his pocket\nAnd a smile on his face\nHe followed with obedience\nAnd fell in the nettles\n[Verse 2]\nAfterwards those spiky whispers\nSaid he brought his own rope\nAnd skipped the bits they loathed\nDidnâ€™t scramble to find a dock leaf\nAnd capture back our hope\nTo advice his mind had closed\nHe lost all of his foot holds\n[Chorus]\nAnd with a scowl in his pocket\nAnd a smile on his face\nHe followed with obedience\nAnd fell in the nettles\nFell in the nettles, fell in the nettles\n\n[Bridge]\nHe was a toothpick and the garlic\nAnd the cinder upon the path\nHad failed to blunt or hinder\nThe slow collapse\nAnd clinging to the door frame\nHe was trapped\nOff to a reminder\nOf where he had been\n[Chorus]\nWith a smile in his pocket\nAnd a scowl on his face\nThere was nowhere to flee\nSo sat content in the nettles\n[Outro]\n(Ah!)"
