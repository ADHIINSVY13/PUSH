  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOut of the tree of life I just picked me a plum\nYou came along and everything started to hum\nStill, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come\n[Chorus]\nBest is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?\nYou think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA-Wait till the warm-up's underway\nWait till our lips have met\nAnd wait till you see that sunshine day\nYou ain't seen nothin' yet\n[Chorus]\nThe best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?\nBest is yet to come, come the day you're mine\n[Verse 2]\nCome the day you're mine\nI'm gonna teach you to fly\nWe've only tasted the wine\nWe're gonna drain the cup dry\n[Bridge]\nWait till your charms are right for these arms to surround\nYou think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA-Wait till you're locked in my embrace\nWait till I draw you near\nA-Wait till you see that sunshine place\nAin't nothin' like it here\n[Chorus]\nThe best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?\nThe best is yet to come, come the day you're mine\n[Outro]\nCome the day you're mine\nAnd you're gonna be mine"
