  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was biting the time zone\nAnd we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams\nAnd threw caution to the colourful\nThen we fell asleep in the car\nUntil the bumps woke me up in your grip\nAnd the tide took me to your mouth\nAnd then swept me back down to your palms\nIt's them that put me inside the reminder\nThat yours is the only ocean\n[Chorus]\nYours is the only ocean\nThat I wanna swing from\nYours is the only ocean\nThat I wanna hang on\n[Verse 2]\nI've got this ego mechanic\nShe's always trying to give me vitamins\nAh, she'd be frightened of your reflection\nI preferred her as a cartoon\nIf I could be someone else for a week\nI'd spend it chasing after you\n'Cause she's not shattering my attitudes\nNo matter how she folds the potion\nYours is the only ocean\n\n[Chorus]\nYours is the only ocean\nThat I wanna swing from\nYours is the only ocean\nThat I want to hang on to\n[Post-Chorus]\nYours is the only ocean\nYours is the only ocean\nYours is the only ocean\nYours is the only ocean\n[Bridge]\nPotion approaching, shield your eyes\nPotion approaching, visualise\nHolding a token, swollen in size\nPotion approaching, shield your eyes\n[Outro]\nOh, but if we're gonna escape though\nWe really ought to think it through\nWould you like me to build you a go-kart?"
