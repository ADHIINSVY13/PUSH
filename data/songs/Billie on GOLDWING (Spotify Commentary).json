  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\nUm... \"GOLDWING\", I... wrote a song that is kind of a metaphor for, you know, a young woman, especially in the industry, or in... you know, life, that is pure, and I don't mean \na virgin\n, I mean, like a young non-exploited, non-traumatized person. A metaphor for that being, you know, a goldwinged angel."
