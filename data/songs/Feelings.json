Ah\n'Cause I'm bad at reading signs\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do\nIf you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line\nKnow we've been friends\nAnd love only knows broken ends\nYeah, that's what you said\nBut girl, let me change your mind\n[Chorus]\nMmm, mmm, mmm\n'Cause feelings are hard to find\nMmm, mmm, mmm\nFeelings are hard\n[Verse 2]\nBut I feel 'em in my chest\nA tiny war within\nBut when I pull you closer\nGirl, I can't explain\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do\nIf you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line\nKnow we've been friends\nAnd love only knows broken ends\nYeah, that's what you said\nBut girl, let me change your mind\n[Chorus]\nMmm, mmm, mmm\n'Cause feelings are hard to find\nMmm, mmm, mmm\nFeelings are hard, yeah\n[Bridge]\nAnd I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes\nThat it hurts sometimes when I'm with you\nAnd I know, and I know that it hurts sometimes\nThat it hurts sometimes, but I miss you\nAnd I know, and I know that it's on your mind\nThat it's on your mind when I kiss you\nBut I wanna do whatever you wanna do\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wanna do whatever you wanna do\nIf you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line\nKnow we've been friends\nAnd love only knows broken ends\nYeah, that's what you said\nBut girl, let me change your mind\n\n[Chorus]\nMmm, mmm, mmm\n'Cause feelings are hard to find\nMmm, mmm, mmm\nFeelings are hard to find, yeah"
