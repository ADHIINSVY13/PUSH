  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTune me in to the wild side of life\nI'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife\nTake me to the garretts where the artists have died\nShow me the courtrooms where the judges have lied\nLet me drink deeply from the water and the wine\nLight colored candles in dark dreary mines\nLook in the mirror and stare at myself\nAnd wonder if that's really me on the shelf\n[Chorus]\nAnd each day I learn just a little bit more\nI don't know why but I do know what for\nIf we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon\nOh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune\n[Verse 2]\nTake me down alleys where the murders are done\nIn a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun\nWant to read books in the studies of men\nBorn on the breeze and die on the wind\nIf I was an artist who paints with his eyes\nI'd study my subject and silently cry\nCry for the darkness to come down on me\nFor confusion to carry on turning the wheel\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd each day I learn just a little bit more\nI don't know why but I do know what for\nIf we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon\nOh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune"
