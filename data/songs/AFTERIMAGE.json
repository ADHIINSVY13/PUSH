  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSinging for a while can put a damper in your mood\nLighting will strike twice in my heart cause I let you\n[Verse 1]\nInside of my brain\nGave you my body\nI made so many tunes\nAnd now none of them sound like you\n[Chorus]\nAfter sound\nJust keep moving on\nWaltzing around\nWith an afterimage through town\nJust an afterimage to me now\n[Verse 2]\nThat one night where we stood in the rain and let our lips fall together\nWoke up next morning sick as a dog and we laughed at each other before throwing up\n[Verse 3]\nNever before have I let mysеlf\nGo down the path of love\nLike this, it’s hard to lеt go\nOf something that made me forget\n\n[Chorus]\nThe fall down\nJust keep moving on\nWaltzing around\nWith an afterimage through town\nJust an afterimage to me now\n[Hook]\nI stared for too long\nI drew him too far away from me\nI painted our lives in the sky\nDid I overdo it now?\nOh, I hate that I’m so overbearing\nNothing ever goes to plan when you are the reason it's raining indoors\n[Chorus]\nAll gone now\nJust keep moving on\nWaltzing around\nWith an afterimage through town\nJust an afterimage to me now\n[Outro]\nMaybe that’s all it was from day one\nI let my thoughts run wild\nAnd I made this out to be more than it is\nOnce again"
