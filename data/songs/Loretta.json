  "lyrics": "Oh Loretta she's my barroom girl\nWears them sevens on her sleeve\nDances like a diamond shines\nTell me lies I love to believe\nHer age is always 22\nHer laughing eyes a hazel hue\nSpends my money like water falls\nLoves me like I want her to\nOh, Loretta, won't you say to me\nDarling, put your guitar on\nHave a little shot of booze\nPlay a blue a and wailing song\nMy guitar rings a melody\nMy guitar sings, Loretta's fine\nLong and lazy, blonde and free\nAnd I can have her any time\nSweetest at the break of day\nPrettiest in the setting sun\nShe don't cry when I can't stay\n'least not till she's all alone\nLoretta, I won't be gone long\nKeep your dancing slippers on\nKeep me on your mind a while\nI'll be back, babe, to make you smile"
