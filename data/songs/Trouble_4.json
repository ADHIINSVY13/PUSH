Let's get it. \n Aye shouts out to my lil homie, Young Oliver\n[Sample: Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), \n Guy \n , and \nGuy 2\n]\nWhat do you want fucko? You want something?\nL swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead\nDon't shoot\n[Verse]\nAll I see is\nBlack roses, drug dealer poses\nShoveling that devil's angel up they noses\nNever let jail turn my shine into Moses\nCouldn't cleanse my soul with them civil rights' hoses\nPanoramic roof under glass like a coaster\nBackseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur\nKilian loafers\n[?]\nPhoto op is priceless, frame my wanted posters\n[?]\nWar brings casualty\nBitch have my son before I face that tragedy\nI ordered hits, She orders Mahi\nR-I-P Vivian [?]\nShoutout to [?]"
