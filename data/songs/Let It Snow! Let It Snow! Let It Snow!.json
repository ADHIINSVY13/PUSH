Frank Sinatra]\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd my dear, we're still goodbying\nBut as long as you love me so\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n[Bridge: Swanson Quartet & (Frank Sinatra)]\nHe doesn't care if \nit's in below\nHe's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow\nHe don't care about the cold and the winds that blow\nHe just says, \"Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow\"\n(Let It Snow!)\nOooooh-Wee goes the storm\nWhy should he worry when he's nice and warm\nHis gal by his side and the lights turned low\nHe just says, \"Let it snow, let it snow\"\n(I Don't Care!)\n\n[Chorus: Frank Sinatra & (Swanson Quartet)]\nThe weather outside Is frightful\nBut that fire Is ummm... delightful\nSince we've no place to go\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow!\nIt doesn't show signs of stopping\nAnd I've brought lots of corn for popping\nThe lights are way down low\nSo let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!\n(Let it snow!)\n[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra]\nWhen we've finally say goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out In a storm\nBut If you'll only hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n[Verse 2: All]\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd my dear we're still goodbying\nLong as you love me so\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow!"
