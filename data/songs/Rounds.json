(Yes)\nMornin' slow strokes, got you runnin' late (Yes, haha)\nWhat if we never met? You'd be still in debt\nBecause we know the world lives, now the scene is set\nAlways chauffeurs, new trench coats\nHow I got her wet on a big boat?\nI get it ten bags at a time (At a time)\nI'm the richest and I did it off of rhyme (Woo)\nNo longer affiliated with these rap squads\nOne of one amongst rap gods\nWhite gloves with a head full of dark thoughts (Huh)\nSoft sex, first time with a mob boss\nPull up in a Rolls Royce, new chariot\nHeavenly angles, John Legend's an angel\nThis the moment, since we all needed the clarity\nThey wanna change you, all they want is the same you (\nMaybach Music\n)\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nBaby, I owe you rounds\nYou know I'm gon' put it down, oh, oh\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nAyy, ooh, ah, yeah\nBaby, I-I-I, I-I-I owe you rounds\nOoh, I-I'm gon' put it down, baby\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nBaby, I owe you rounds\nYou know I'm gon' put it down, oh, oh\n[Outro: John Legend]\nCotton candy fingertips\nPrint my lips\nI'ma slip inside those hips\nEase your grip"
