  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI write this song in memory of\nThe wayward smile, the boy we wonâ€™t forget\nThe soul you took away from us\nThe river flows the tears that we wept\n[Chorus]\nMissing you\nIs all that needs to be said\nMore than blue\nThe words inside my head\nAnd I know that you're gone\nAnd I know that you're gone\n[Verse 2]\nThe cheeky smile of jokes and laughs\nThe memories of times we crossed the line\nThe stepping stones across my mind\nWashed away, we all now feel so blind\n[Chorus]\nMissing you\nIs all that needs to be said\nMore than blue\nThe words inside my head\nAnd I know that you're gone (Goodbye)\nAnd I know that you're gone (Goodbye)\nAnd I know that you're gone (Goodbye)\nAnd I know that you're gone (Goodbye)"
