You and me\nMight be meant to be, can't unsee it\nBut I don't wanna cause no scene\nI'm usually so unproblematic\nSo independent, tell me why\n'Cause the boy is mine, mine\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSomethin' about him is made for somebody like me\nBaby, come over, come over (Over)\nAnd God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying\n[Chorus]\nThe boy is mine\nI can't wait to try him\nLe-let's get intertwined\nThe stars, they aligned\nThе boy is mine\nWatch me take my timе\nI can't believe my mind\nThe boy is divine\nBoy is mine\n[Verse 2]\nPlease know this ain't what I planned for\nProbably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on\nThere's gotta be a reason why\nMy girls, they always come through in a sticky situation\nSay, \"It's fine\" (It's fine)\nHappens all the time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSomethin' about him is made for somebody like me\nBaby, come over, come over (Over)\nAnd God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying\n[Chorus]\nThe boy is mine\nI can't wait to try him\nLe-let's get intertwined\nThe stars, they aligned\nThe boy is mine\nWatch me take my time\nI can't believe my mind\nThe boy is divine\nBoy is—\n[Bridge]\nAnd I know it's simply meant to be\nAnd I, I take full accountability for all these tears\nPromise you, I'm not usually like this\nShit, it's like news to me, to me\nBut I can't ignore my heart, boy\n[Chorus]\nThe boy is mine\nI can't wait to try him (Oh, yeah)\nLe-let's get intertwined\nThe stars, they aligned\nThe boy is mine\nWatch me take my time\nI can't believe my mind\nThe boy is divine\nBoy is mine"
