I meant every word\nTo my connection, it left me, in the moment I was gone\nI guess that I'll stumble along and\nI'll land where I land when I land\n[Chorus]\nJust get a little rest some time\nI'd care a little less if I could\nYou said it ought to be just fine\nSwear it on your life, it's alright\n(It's alright)\n[Verse 3]\nRed bag on your shoulder with the price tag on\nYour hair band through a cold phase, it's time we settle up\nIf my head won't turn in your direction\nI'll land where I land when I land\n\n[Chorus]\nJust get a little rest some time\nI'd care a little less if I could\nYou said it ought to be just fine\nSwear it on your life, it's alright\n(It's alright)"
