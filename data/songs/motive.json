(Motive)\nWhat's your motive?\nWhat's your motive? (Ah)\nSo tell me, what's your motive? (Motive)\nWhat's your motive?\nWhat's your motive? (Ah)\n[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]\nI could call bullshit out from a mile away (Don't say)\nYou want me if you can keep comin' back for me\nMight have to curve you if you just can't talk straight (Just say)\nSay what you mean 'cause you might get it\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]\n'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'\nTo see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms\nI admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it\nBut before I lead you on\n[Chorus: Ariana Grande & \nDoja Cat\n]\nTell me, what's your motive?\nWhat's your motive?\nWhat's your motive?
