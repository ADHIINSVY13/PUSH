I can't hear myself drink\nWe used to do the freak like seven days a week\nIt's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh\nTalk to me nicely, don't come at me loud\nYou had a Benz at sixteen, I could barely afford a Audi\nHow you gon' try to say sometimes it's not about me?\nMan, I don't know what I would do without me\nBillionaire sport, step up to the court\nThey rented a room, we bought the resort\nGod got me, baby, God got the children\nThe devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'\nTime and silence a luxury\nCussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody\nGod got us, baby, God got the children\nThe devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'\nTime and space is a luxury\nBut you came here to show that you still in love with me\nStartin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'\n'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah\nBut I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately\nTryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me\n (\nWheezy outta here\n)\nYour gun off safety\nSpeak first, don't break me\nHarsh words, you're angry\nLord, don't take me, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me\nWrap Your arms around with Your mercy\nLord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me\nI give up on doin' things my way\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh\n (\nWheezy outta here\n)"
