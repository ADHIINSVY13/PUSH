  "lyrics": "I took a trip on a train\nAnd I thought about you\nI passed a shadowy lane\nAnd I thought about you\nTwo or three cars parked under the stars\nWinding stream\nMoon shining down on some little town\nAnd with each beam, the same old dream\nAnd every stop that we made\nOh, I thought about you\nAnd when I pulled down the shade\nThen I really felt blue\nI peeped through the crack\nLooked at the track\nOh, I'm going back to you\nAnd what did I do? I thought about you\nThere were two or three cars parked under the stars\nWinding stream\nMoon shining down on some little town\nAnd with each beam, the same old dream\nAnd then I peeped through the crack\nAnd looked at the track\nOh, I'm going back to you\nAnd what did I do? I thought about you"
