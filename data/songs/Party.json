(Hey hey)\nCome back and play\nCome back and play, come back and play\nPlay, play it, play it (Yeah!)\n(Go get 'em, boy!)\n(Let's party!)\n[Guitar Solo]\n(Yeah!)\n(Hahahahaha!)\n(Give it, give it)\n(Ahh, ahh)\n\n[Bridge]\nWe had a food fight in somebody's face\nWe were up all night singing (Singing)\nAnd giving a chase\nBut in the cold light of day next morning\nEverybody was hung over\n[Chorus]\nHey, come back and play\n(Come back and play)\nCome back and play\nWe got all night, all day\nEverybody's gone away\nWhy don't you come back and play? (And play)\nCome back and play\nWe got all night\nWe got all day\nWe got all night and day, ah!\nCome back, come back, come back\nCome back, come back and play!\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\n(Hey, hey, hey!)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nThe party is over"
