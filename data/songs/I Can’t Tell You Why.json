  "lyrics": "Not only the first song finished for the album The Long Run, but also the first Eagles song to feature new bassist Timothy B. Schmit on lead vocals.\n[Verse 1]\nLook at us, baby, up all night\nTearing our love apart\nAren't we the same two people who live\nThrough years in the dark? Ahh-ah\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nEvery time I try to walk away\nSomething makes me turn around and stay\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd I can't tell you why\n[Verse 2]\nWhen we get crazy, it just ain't right\n(Try to keep your head, little girl)\nGirl, I get lonely, too\nYou don't have to worry, just hold on tight\n(Don't get caught in your little world)\n'Cause I love you\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nNothing's wrong as far as I can see\nWe make it harder than it has to be\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd I can't tell you why\nNo, baby, I can't tell you why\nI can't tell you why\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh)\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nEvery time I try to walk away\nSomething makes me turn around and stay\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd I can't tell you why\nNo, no baby, I can't tell you why\nI can't tell you why\nI can't tell you why\n[Outro Guitar Solo]"
