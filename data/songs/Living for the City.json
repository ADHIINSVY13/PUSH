I'm getting on there, hold it. \nThanks a lot. \nWow, New York, just like I pictured it. \nSkyscrapers and everything. \nHey, hey, brother, hey, come here, slick. (Huh?)\nHey, you look, you look hip, man. \nHey, you wanna make yourself five bucks, man? (Yeah)\nYou look hip, run this across the street for me right quick. \nOkay, run this across the street for me.\n \nWhat? Huh? I didn't know! What?\nGimme your hands up, you punk!\nI'm just going across the street. \nPut that leg up, shut your mouth. \nHell no, what did I do?\nOkay, turn around, turn around. \nPut your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go. \nA jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years. \nWhat?\nCome on, come on, get in that cell, nig​ger.\n \nGod, Lord. \n\n[Verse 5]\nHis hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty\nHe spends his life walking the streets of New York City\nHe's almost dead from breathing in air pollution\nHe tried to vote but to him there's no solution\nLiving just enough, just enough for the city\n[Verse 6]\nI hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow\nAnd that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow\nThis place is cruel, nowhere could be much colder\nIf we don't change, the world will soon be over\nLiving just enough, stop giving just enough for the city\n[Chorus]\nDa da da, da da da da\nDa da da da la la la\nDa da da da\nDa da da la la\nDa da da, da da da da\nDa da da da la la la\nDa da da da\nDa da da la la\nDa da da, da da da da\nDa da da da la la la\nDa da da da\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nOh lo lo\nLo lo, lo lo\nLo lo, lo lo\nLo \nlo"
