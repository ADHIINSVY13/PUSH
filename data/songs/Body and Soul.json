  "lyrics": "My heart is sad and lonely\nFor you I cry, for you dear only\nI tell you I mean it?\nI'm all for you, body and soul\nI spend my days in longing\nAnd wondering why it's me you're wronging\nWhy haven't you seen it?\nI'm all for you, body and soul\nI can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it\nThat you'd turn away romance\nAre you pretending? Don't say it's the ending\nI wish I could have one more chance to prove, dear\nMy life is hell you're making\nYou know I'm yours for just the taking\nI'd gladly surrender\nMyself to you, body and soul\nI can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it\nThat you'd turn away from romance\nAre you pretending? Don't say it's the ending\nI wish I could have one more chance to prove, dear\nMy life is hell you're making\nYou know I'm yours for just the taking\nI'd gladly surrender, dear\nMyself to you, body and soul"
