  "lyrics": "Living in a world that dies within\nYou are they who try and touch the wind\nYou could be the blessed one that\nMakes me love you\nAnd doing what you've never done before\nTaking every wave that hits the shore\nYou could be a silver star that shines\nOn my blue island\nSee you on a blue island\nTake you to a blue island\nYou can see the rain\nYou can feel the pain\nThat no part of me is going through\nEverybody say, we can find a way\nDo you know the place you're going to\nYou're going to a blue island\nThis is what the lonely heart must know\nThis is what it takes to make it grow\nYou could be a child alone\nBut you may save the world\nMaybe it's the words that mean goodbye\nThere but for the grace of God go I\nI can see an open door that leads to my blue island\nGonna be a blue island\nSee you on a blue island\nTake you to a blue island\n\nBlue island\nBlue island\nBlue island"
