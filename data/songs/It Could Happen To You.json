  "lyrics": "Hide your heart from sight, lock your dreams at night\nIt could happen to you\nDon't count stars or you might stumble\nSomeone drops a sigh and down you tumble\nKeep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring\nIt could happen to you\nAll I did was wonder how your arms would be\nAnd it happened to me\nKeep an eye on spring, run when church bells ring\nIt could happen to you\nAll I did was wonder how your arms would be\nAnd it happened to me\nAll I did was wonder how your arms would be\nAnd it happened to me"
