  "lyrics": "A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces\nAn airline ticket to romantic places\nAnd still my heart has wings\nThese foolish things remind me of you\nA tinkling piano in the next apartment\nThose stumblin'words That told you what my heart meant\nA fairground's painted swings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you\nYou came\nYou saw\nYou conquered me\nWhen you did that to me\nI knew somehow this had to be\nThe winds of March That made my heart a dancer\nA telephone that rings But who's to answer\nOh, how the ghost of you clings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you\nFirst daffodils\nAnd long excited cables\nAnd candle lights\nOn little corner tables\nAnd still my heart has wings\nThese foolish things remind me of you\nThe park at evening\nWhen the bell has sounded\nThe Isle de France\nWith all the gulls around it\nThe beauty that is spring\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you\nHow strange\nHow sweet\nTo find you still\nThese things are dear to me\nThey seem to bring you near to me\nThe sigh of midnight trains\nAt empty stations\nSilk stockings thrown aside\nDance invitations\nOh how the ghost of you clings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you\nGardenia perfume\nLingering on a pillow\nWild strawberries\nOnly seven francs a kilo\nAnd still my heart has wings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you\nThe smile of Garbo\nAnd the scent of roses\nThe waiters whistling\nAs the last bar closes\nThe song that Crosby sings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you\nHow strange\nHow sweet\nTo find you still\nThese things are dear to me\nThey seem to bring you near to me\nThe scent of smoldering leaves\nThe wail of steamers\nTwo lovers on the street\nWho walk like dreamers\nOh how the ghost of you clings\nThese foolish things\nRemind me of you"
