  "lyrics": "I can't believe that it's real\nThe way that you make me feel\nA burning deep down inside\nA love that I cannot hide\nOur love is you and me baby\nThat makes the world go 'round\nAnd if you've been doin' lovin' with me\nLayin' all my troubles down\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nTake me by the hand\nShow me\nHere I am, baby\nIt always ends up this way\nMe begging you every day\nA love that I cannot have\nYou broke my heart into half\nOur love is you and me baby\nThat makes the world go 'round\nAnd if you've been doin' lovin' with me\nLayin' all my troubles down\n\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nTake me by the hand\nSqueeze me\nHere I am, baby\nWhen I'm down\nI can always call you\nFor a helpin' hand\nI know you'll do the best you can\nBut it don't take much from me\nJust my cup of Joe\nOh there's love inside me\nI believe there's going to be an explosion\nIt's tough for me, oh baby\nI can do worry\nTell me all your troubles\nYou won't ever have to worry now\nJust one more thing, ask everybody\nEverybody you see, no, no\nYou'll find yourself lost\nAnd alone on a darkened street\n\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nTake me by the hand\nShow me\nHere I am, take me\nHere I am, show me, won't you\nHere I am, baby\nCome and take me\nWon't you teach me, baby?\nWon't you take me by the hand?\nTeach me\nHere I am, baby"
