Can’t you tell I'm wired?\nTell me nothing lasts, like I don't know\nYou could kiss my— asking about my motto\n\n[Interlude]\nYou should enter it in festivals or carnivals\nThoughts? Pretty good reaction\nPretty cool... right?\n[Chorus]\nYou are my strange addiction\nYou are my strange addiction\nMy doctors can't explain\nMy symptoms or my pain\nBut you are my strange addiction\n[Outro]\nDid you like it? Did you like that?\nUm, which part?"
