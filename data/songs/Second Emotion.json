(Do you?)\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\nYou really got me open (Do you?)\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\n[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]\nHigh heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seent ya\nMovies all around, but you look like the feature\nHad another meeting, now my plan is to meet you\nGot my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya\nAll I wanna do is greet ya\nInfatuated, sorry if I stare\nWhere you posted up? I wanna be there\nWay you curved up, it just ain't fair\nNo, it ain't\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nTry to bite my tongue, but I can't take it\nI got whiplash from me turnin' my head\nHave somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it\nI'd rather take my chance with you instead\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\nYou really got me open (Do you?)\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber & \nTravis Scott\n]\nGot me feeling giddy (\nAh\n), like, \"La, la, la, la\" (\nYeah\n)\nStruck a match, you got me litty, like, \"La, la, la, la\" (\nIt's lit\n)\nYou got the keys to my city (\nOoh\n), like, \"La, la, la, la\" (\nStraight up\n)\nDo you second that emotion, baby? (\nAh, yeah\n)\n[Verse 2: Travis Scott]\nMmm, yeah\nOut to big boys (It's lit)\nSpring her off the hitch (Yeah), everything legit\nMovin' like the blitz (Blitz), crib like the Ritz (Like the Ritz)\nSo you know there's room (Skrrt)\nSo, baby, please\n(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)\nDon't like to talk to bitch (Yeah), just like to play the wish\nI know the problem is they bothered by the kid (I'm tryna pop another one in)\nOh, you sent the jet out for me?\nYou tryna ball harder than me?\n[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]\nDid I come 'cross your radar?\nCross your mind now and later?\nDo you feel like you know me?\nIt's just a part of nature\nLet's ask each other questions\nCan we do each other favors?\nWould you mind the labor? Baby\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nTry to bite my tongue, but I can't take it (Ooh-wee)\nI got whiplash from me turnin' my head (Hey, hey, hey)\nHave somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it (Ooh-wee)\nI'd rather take my chance with you instead\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\nDo you second that emotion? (Do you?)\nYou really got me open (Do you?)\nDo you second that emotion?
