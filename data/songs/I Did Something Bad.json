(So good)\nThey say I did somethin' bad\nBut why's it feel so (Good) good?\nMost fun I ever had (Most fun I ever had)\nAnd I'd do it over and over and over again if I could\nIt just felt so good (Good), good\n[Post-Chorus]\nRa-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da\n (Bad)\nRa-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da\nOh, they say I did somethin' bad (They say I did somethin' bad)\nRa-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da\nThen why's it feel so good, good?\n[Outro]\nSo good (Bad), why's it feel so good?\nWhy's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)\nIt just felt so good, good"
