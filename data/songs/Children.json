Who's got it?\nWhose heart is the biggest?\nWear it on your sleeve\nBet we can make a difference\nWho's got the heart? Who's got it?\nWhose heart is the biggest?\nWear it on your sleeve\nBet we can make a difference\nOh yeah\nWho's got the heart?\nOh yeah\n\n[Verse]\nWhat about the children?\nLook at all the children we can change\nWhat about a vision?\nBe a visionary for a change\nWe're the generation\nWho's gonna be the one to fight for it?\nWe're the inspiration\nDo you believe enough to die for it?\n[Chorus]\nWho's got the heart?
