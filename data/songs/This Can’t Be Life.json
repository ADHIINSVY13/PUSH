Of course it's real\nPassing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans\n'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min\nDawg, you know a couple surahs out the Qur'an\nI guess you all on your Dīn and I ain't on mine\nStop that, \nAhki\n – 'fore I send shots through your body\nMake 'em feel \nHell on Earth\n before Allah drop me\nI feel the line's drawn here, nothing more can stop me\n'Til them Feds pick me up, or them boys pop me\nThere's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans –\nAmatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin\nMy seeds, dawg, \ngotta teach 'em that before I leave, dawg\nShit, I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dawg\nI come back in the afterlife\nLike, fuck it, I done touched Hell twice – what's the meaning?\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nThis can't be life, this can't be love\nThis can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us\nThis can't be life, this can't be love\nThis can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us\n[Verse 3: Scarface]\nLife... yeah... uhh...\nNow as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'\nI got a phone call from one of my nigs\nSaid my homeboy, Reek, he just lost one of his kids\nAnd when I heard that, I just broke into tears\nAnd see, in the second hand – you don't really know how this is\nBut when it hits that close to home, you feel the pain at the crib\nSo I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news\nNow we both depressed, counting our blessings, 'cause Brad's two\nPraying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars\nLoving your kids, just like you was ours\nAnd I'm hurting for you, dawg – but ain't nobody pain is like yours\nI just know that Heaven'll open these doors\nAnd ain't no bright side to losing life, but you can view it like this\nGod's got open hands, homie, he in the midst\nOf good company, who loves all and hates not one\nAnd one day, you gon' be with your son\nI could've rapped about my hard times on this song\nBut Heaven knows I woulda been wrong\nI wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love\nIt wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us\nThis can't be life\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nThis can't be life, this can't be love\nThis can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us\nThis can't be life, this can't be love\nThis can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us\nThis can't be life..."
