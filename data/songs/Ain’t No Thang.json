Say\nStay in your little hole, then coward, duck your head\n\"You don't know who you be fuckin' with, you's better off dead\"\nIs what I say, best run the other way\nIn case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now\nMy kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp'\nMake yourself exempt\nPussy-footin' around be gettin' y'all nowhere but stuck\nNowhere to duck, bullets flyin', niggas dyin'\nBy gettin' blasted, how drastic\nThey got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do\nI got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do\nBut naw (Naw, naw), I take that back, that's my problem\nTurnin' and walkin' away just ain't gon' work when they be robbin'\nAs long as Big Boi's still livin', never standin' by my lonesome\nStep up, nigga, if you want some\n[Chorus: OutKast & \nBig Boi\n]\nYeah, yeah\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke-out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, \nmack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke-out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, \nmack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWell, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits (Yeah)\nIt's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them player-istic hits (Yeah)\nI'm quick to stop a sucker flow like menopause at fifty\nOriginal ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch\nI used to sell dope, but in 1994, I'm makin' \nSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik\nBut, see, these voices in my skull has got me reminiscin'\nAbout the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens\nShe had me makin' better grades to make a better life\nBut I never had no love or respect 'cause we's gon' be alright\nI ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit\nI carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix\nYeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now\nI'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now\nI call the wild because it's time to take the streets\nSo if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat\nI'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal\nJust an international player, comin' through your stereo\n[Chorus: OutKast & \nBig Boi\n]\nYeah, you see\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing (\nIt don't stop\n)\nWe's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, \nmack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, mack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\n\n[Verse 3: André 3000]\n.357 to your forehead\nThere'll be more dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid\nBut Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my milli' right vi-near me\nMy nine be doin' fine until these niggas wants to clear me\nOff my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollerin' ghetto\nDon't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go\nBut I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you\nAin't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew\nOn the concrete, remember when we ran deep?\n'Member at the party when we served them niggas dandy?\nThey know not to test us, test me, do me, try me\nTrippin' with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me\nOne is in the air and one is in the chamber\nY'all ask me what the fuck I'm doin', I'm releasin' anger\nQuick to dodge danger, I'm takin' it one day\nAt a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way\nYou can sway with André, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch\nJust to let you know, yeah\n[Chorus: OutKast & \nBig Boi\n]\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, \nmack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, \nmack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nIt's on, my friend, on the road again, I'm travelin'\nDo more than sixty-five on 85 off in my Cadillac\nI got that nigga Dre, he ridin' shotgun\nAnd got my pump under my seat in case these youngsters wanna have some fun\nI'll do it if I have to, bustin' caps with this here heater\nLoadin' clip up after clip, I'm packin' my gauge if I feel it\nThe Glock, the gat, the nine, the heater\nSee, I be bustin' caps like my amp be bustin' speakers\nSo how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?\nYou 'posed to be the quickest draw, my man, well, hail 'em faster\nUh, one, two, three, you need to think about the future\nBefore I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead\nFrom my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave\nYou fuckin' slave, you better try another way\nTo take me out is truly somethin' difficult\nDon't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke\nI'm out of bullets, lettin' loose my last clip\nI'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga gettin' pistol whipped\nYeah, that's how I do\nYou know that's how I do, you know that's how I do\n[Chorus: OutKast & \nBig Boi\n]\nYeah, you see\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, \nmack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\nAin't no thing but a chicken wing\nWe's havin' a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just the \npimps\n, players, mack daddies, \nEast Point\nIt's\n all about that cess in your chest (\nIt's the joint\n)\n[Outro: Big Boi]\nYeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfuckin'\nOrganized Noize, PA\nGoodie Mob, Big Gipp, and all the niggas around the East Point way\nCollege Park is really on the map\nWe comin' around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped\nWith the motherfuckin' guns and the motherfuckin' Glocks\nThe heaters, the gats, nigga, don't— yeah, it don't stop"
