You smokin' crack?\n'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back\nI'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground\n'Fore I put some wack shit out\nI'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark\nY'all steady tryna drown a shark\nAin't gon' do nothin' but piss me off\nLid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off\nSee me leap out, pull a piece out\nFuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out\nFuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle\nTalk is cheap\nMotherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap\n\"Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?\nHe tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that\"\nMan, I hate this crap\nThis ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act\nWhen we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops\n\n[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]\nAin't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried\nThe only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide\nI have died clinically\nArrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy\nGot drunk then I finished him\nI'm every nigga's favorite archenemy\nPhysically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef\nI spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently\nI'm not what you think\nI appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered\nI can't stay away from a razor\nI just want my face in a paper\nI wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres \n(Bah)\nI'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into\nA mad man, Son of Sam, bitch,\n \nI'm surgical\nI'm allergic to dyin', you think not?\nYou got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops\n[Verse 3: Kon Artis]\nI was happy havin' a deal at first\nThought money would make me happy\nBut it only made my pain worse\nIt hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg\nAnd you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls\nAnd you're stressed from the calls of your new friends\nBeggin' with their hands out\nCheckin' for your record when it's sellin'\nWhen it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends\nNo girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin\nYou think, \"Damn\"\n when you slam into the wall and you fall\nOut the car and try to crawl with one arm\nI'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol\nIf my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call?\nWhen the music stops\n\n[Verse 4: Kuniva]\nLet's see how many of your men loyal\nWhen I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil\nI'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?\nYour head just explode with red stuff\nI'm handcuffed, tossed in the paddy-wagon\nBraggin' about how you shouted like a coward\nBullets devoured you, showered you niggas\nIf I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance\nUnderstand, I can enhance the spirit of man\nDeath itself, it can't hurt me\nJust the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me\nYou ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk\nBe smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark\nHug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war wit' your life\nFuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife (\nAh\n)\nDeliver that shit that coroners like\nYou hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night\nWhen the music stops\n[Verse 5: Proof]\nInstigators\n turn pits in cages\nLet loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors\nY'all don't want war, y'all want talk\nIn the dark, my dogs all bark like, \"Woof\"\nProof, nigga, I'm a wolf\nGet your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves\nStomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose\nThe more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves\nIt's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues\nPut a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga\nOr make the news, bet you all y'all move\nWhen the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop\n\n[Verse 6: Bizarre]\nMusic has changed my life in so many ways\nBrain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade\nLL told me to rock the bells\nN.W.A said \"Fuck tha Police,\" now I'm in jail\n'93 was strictly R&B\nFucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci\nMichael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?\nAss cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight\nFlyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack\nTransvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back\nM.O.P.\n had me grimy and gritty\nMarilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties\nLudacris told me to throw them bows\nNow I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow\nVoices in my head, I'm goin' in shock\nI'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops"
