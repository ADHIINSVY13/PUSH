  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou may not believe it\nBut I don't believe in miracles anymore\nAnd when I think about it\nI don't believe I ever did for sure\nAll the things I've said in songs\nAll the purple prose\n \nyou bought from me\nReality's just black and white\nThe sentimental things I'd write\nNever meant that much to me\n[Chorus]\nI used to be the main express\nAll steam and whistles headin' west\nPickin' up my pain from door to door\nRidin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime\nBut this train don't stop\nThis train don't stop\nThis train don't stop there anymore\n[Verse 2]\nYou don't need to hear it\nBut I'm dried up and sick to death of love\nAnd if you need to know it\nI never really understood that stuff\nAll the stars and bleeding hearts\nAll the tears that welled up in my eyes\nNever meant a thing to me\nRead 'em, as they say, and weep\nI never felt enough to cry\n\n[Chorus]\nI used to be the main express\nAll steam and whistles headin' west\nPickin' up my pain from door to door\nRidin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime\nBut this train don't stop\nThis train don't stop\nThis train don't stop there anymore\n[Bridge]\nWhen I say that I don't care\nIt really means my engine's breakin' down\nThe chisel chips my heart again\nThe granite cracks beneath my skin\nI crumble into pieces on the ground\n[Chorus]\nI used to be the main express\nAll steam and whistles headin' west\nPickin' up my pain from door to door\nRidin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime\nBut this train don't stop\nThis train don't stop\nThis train don't stop there anymore\n[Outro]\nBut this train don't stop\nThis train don't stop\nThis train don't stop there anymore\nOh yeah"
