  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wanna hear the music play\nI wanna dance and laugh and sway\nI want a happy holiday\nFor Christmas\nI could call you on the phone\nSing a song, it feels like home\nInstead of feeling all alone\nThis Christmas\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd the snow is falling, can't you see?\nIs it Christmas calling out to me?\n[Chorus]\nIf I could be with you tonight\nBeside a fire shining bright\nI'd open up to all of your light\nThis Christmas\nThis mistletoe hangs over me\nI'm looking all around for glee\nSo Santa, give me what I need\nFor Christmas\n[Bridge]\nAnd the friends who feel like family\nWith their secret angels holding me?\nAnd the snow is falling, can't you see?\nIs it Christmas calling out to me?\nIs it Christmas calling out to me?\nIs it Christmas calling out to me?\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna be a Jolly Jones\nInstead of feeling all alone\nI sing a song that feels like home\nThis Christmas"
