  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was searching\nYou were on a mission\nThen our hearts combined like\nA neutron star collision\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI had nothing left to lose\nYou took your time to choose\nThen we told each other\nWith no trace of fear that\n[Chorus]\nOur love would be forever\nAnd if we die, we die together\nLie, I said never\n'Cause our love would be forever\n[Verse 2]\nThe world is broken\nAnd halos fail to glisten\nYou try to make a difference, but\nNo one wants to listen\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHail, the preachers, fake and proud\nTheir doctrines will becloud\nThen they'll dissipate\nLike snowflakes in an ocean\n\n[Chorus]\nLove is forever\nAnd we'll die, we'll die together\nLie, I said never\n'Cause our love could be forever\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow I've got nothing left to lose\nYou take your time to choose\nI can tell you now\nWithout a trace of fear\n[Chorus]\nThat my love will be forever\nAnd we'll die, we'll die together\nLie, I will never\n'Cause our love will be forever\n[Outro]\nOoh\nOoh"
