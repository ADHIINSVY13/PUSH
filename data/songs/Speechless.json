(Oh) Could I give it all up for you? (Oh)\nAnd after all the boys and the girls that we've been through\nWould you give it all up? (Give it all up)\nCould you give it all up (Give it all)\nIf I promise, boy, to you?\nThat I'll never talk again\nAnd I'll never love again\nI'll never write a song\nWon't even sing along\nI'll never love again (Oh)\n[Chorus]\nSo speechless (Ah)\nYou left me speechless, so speechless\nWill you ever talk again?\nOh, boy, why you so speechless? (\nSpeechless, baby\n)\nYou've left me speechless, so speechless\n[Outro]\nSome men may follow me\nBut you choose \"death and company\"\nWhy you so speechless?\nOh-oh"
