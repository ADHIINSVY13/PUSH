This desire is the Electricity.\n[Verse 1]\nDarlin’, tell me something I don’t know\nBe my baby, be my GTO\nCall me something no one else calls me\nI forget how I want it,\n \nthat electricity\n[Chorus]\nWell, my heart was breaking and got left unlocked\nDidn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped\nTell me something I don’t already know\nLike how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?\n[Verse 2]\nLove like locked horns,\n \nlove like dominos\nBe my midnight,\n \nbe my ebb and flow\nI forget how I want it,\n how it crept up on me\nIt takes over, electricity\n[Chorus]\nAnd my heart was breaking and got left unlocked\nDidn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped\nTell me something I don’t already know\nLike how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?\n[Bridge]\nSeparated, there I face it\nLove like thunder, love like falling snow\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me something I don’t already know\nLike how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?"
