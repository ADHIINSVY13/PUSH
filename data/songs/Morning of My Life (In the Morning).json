  "lyrics": "In the morning when the moon is at it's rest\nYou will see me at the time I love the best\nWatching rainbows play on sunlight;\nPools of water iced from cold night,in the morning\n'Tis the morning of my life\nIn the daytime I will meet you as before\nYou will find me waiting by the ocean floor\nBuilding castles in the shifting sands\nIn a world that no one understands\nIn the morning\n'Tis the morning of my life\nIn the morning of my life the\nMinutes take so long to drift away\nPlease be patient with your life\nIt's only morning and you're still to live your day\nIn the ev'ning I will fly you to the moon\nTo the top right hand corner of\nThe ceiling in my room\nWhere w'll stay until the sun shines\nAnother day to swing on clothe's lines\nMay I be yawning\nIt is the morning of my life\nIt is the morning of my life\nIn the morning\nIn the morning\nIn the morning"
