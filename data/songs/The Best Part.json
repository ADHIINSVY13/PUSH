  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI think of you when the wind blows\nI see your face almost everywhere\nSure, maybe Salt Lake is not close\nBut I'm still breathin' you in the air\n[Chorus]\nBecause the best part is knowin'\nThere's somethin' in my dreams that always makes me smile\nIt's you\nThe best part is knowin'\nThere's someone in my life that makes it all worthwhile\nIt's you\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I don't know what to do\nKnow I'm never givin' up, never givin' up on you, baby\nThere's no need to be blue\n[Chorus]\nBеcause the best part is knowin'\nThеre's somethin' in my dreams that always makes me smile\nIt's you\nThe best part is knowin'\nThere's someone in my life that makes it all worthwhile\nIt's you\n\n[Outro]\nYou, you\nYou, you, it's you\nIt's you"
