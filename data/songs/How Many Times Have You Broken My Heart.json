  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nTime after time, you've proven untrue\nLeavin' me home to cry over you\nEach time you come back, say I'm your sweetheart\nBut how many times, dear, have you broken my heart?\n[Chorus]\nNight after night, I've cried over you\nHopin' and prayin' someday you'd be true\nYou took my world, tore it apart\nHow many times have you broken my heart?\n[Verse]\nYou promised, darlin', to be just mine\nBut now I know that was one of your lies\nYou've been untrue right from the start\nBut how many times have you broken my heart?\n[Chorus]\nNight after night, I've cried over you\nHopin' and prayin' someday you'd be true\nYou took my world, tore it apart\nHow many times have you broken my heart?\n[Chorus]\nNight after night, I've cried over you\nHopin' and prayin' someday you'd be true\nYou took my world, tore it apart\nHow many times have you broken my heart?"
