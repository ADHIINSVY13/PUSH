  "lyrics": "Everybody loves somebody sometime\nEverybody falls in love somehow\nSomething in your kiss just told me\n(That) My sometime is now\nEverybody finds somebody someplace\nThere's no telling where love may appear\nSomething in my heart keeps saying\n(That) My someplace is here\nIf I had it in my power\nI'd arrange for every girl to have your charm\nThen every minute, every hour\nEvery boy would find what I've found in your arms\nEverybody loves somebody sometime\nAnd although my dream was overdue\nYour love made it well worth waiting\nFor someone like you"
