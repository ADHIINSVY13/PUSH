  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThings fall apart\nAnd time breaks your heart\nI wasn't there, but I know\nShe was your girl\nYou showed her the world\nBut fell out of love and you both let go\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe was cryin' on my shoulder\nAll I could do was hold her\nOnly made us closer until July\nNow I know that you love me\nYou don't need to remind me\nI should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?\n[Chorus]\nBut I see her in the back of my mind all the time\nLike a fever, like I'm burning alive, like a sign\nDid I cross the line?\n(Mm) Hmm\n[Verse 2]\nWell, good things don't last\nAnd life moves so fast\nI'd never ask who was better\n'Causе she couldn't be\nMore diffеrent from me\nHappy and free in leather\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know that you love me\nYou don't need to remind me\nWanna put it all behind me, but baby\n[Chorus]\nI see her in the back of my mind all the time\nFeels like a fever, like I'm burning alive, like a sign\nDid I cross the line?\n[Bridge]\nYou say no one knows you so well (Oh)\nBut every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt\nValentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel\nI know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder\nDo you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?\n[Outro]\nYou say no one knows you so well\nBut every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt\nValentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel\nI know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself"
