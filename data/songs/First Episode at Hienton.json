  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was one as you were one\nAnd we were two so much in love forever\nI loved the white socks that you wore\nBut you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman\nI joked about your turned-up nose\nAnd criticized your school girl clothes\nBut would I then have paced these roads to love you\n[Chorus]\nFor seasons come and seasons go\nBring forth the rain the sun and snow\nMake Valerie a woman\nAnd Valerie is lonely\n[Verse 2]\nNo more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton\nUndecided with the guardians of the older generation\nA doormat was a sign of welcome\nIn the winter months to come\nAnd in the summer laughing\nThrough the castle ruins we'd run\nFor the quadrangle sang to the sun\nAnd the grace of our feeling\nAnd the candle burned low as we talked of the future\nUnderneath the ceiling\nThere were tears in the sky\nAnd the clouds in your eyes, they were just cover\nFor your thighs were the cushions\nOf my love and yours for each other\n\n[Chorus]\nFor seasons come and seasons go\nBring forth the rain the sun and snow\nMake Valerie a woman\nAnd Valerie is lonely\n[Bridge]\nThe songs still are sung\nIt was fun to be young\nBut please don't be sad where ever you are\nI am who I am\nYou are who you are\n[Outro]\nNow Valerie's a woman\nNow Valerie's a woman\nNow Valerie's a woman"
