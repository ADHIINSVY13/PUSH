I don't know\n[Chorus]\nYou don't wanna break me down\nYou don't wanna say goodbye and\nYou don't wanna turn around\nYou don't wanna make me cry, but\nYou caught me once\n​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again\nYou caught me once\n​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again\n[Post-Chorus]\nDrinks on the patio\n[Verse 2]\nAre you gonna tell me now?\nAre you gonna tell me later?\n'Cause if you think that I don't know\nI'm gonna have to say you're crazy\nI'm getting all dressed up tonight\nDressed up just to hear you, boy\nI already know what you got in store\nWhy I go? Baby, I don't know\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you don't wanna break me down\nYou don't wanna say goodbye and\nYou don't wanna turn around\nYou don't wanna make me cry, but\nYou caught me once\n​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again\nYou caught me once\n​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again\n[Bridge]\nSo you think you're in charge?\nDo you?\nActing like a big shot\nI'm sure\nSo you think you're in charge?\nDo you?\nYou're acting like a big shot\n[Chorus]\nYou don't wanna break me down\nYou don't wanna say goodbye\n and\nYou don't wanna turn around\nYou don't wanna make me cry but\nYou caught me once\n​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again\nYou caught me once\n​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again"
