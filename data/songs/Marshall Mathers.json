Give me back my sixteen dollars!\nAll I see is sissies in magazines smilin' (Hee-hee!)\nWhatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?\nWhatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'\nAnd gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?\nNew Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick\nBoy, girl groups make me sick\nAnd I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public\nI'ma love it (Hahaha)\nVanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh), he said some shit in \nVibe\n to spite me (Yo)\nThen went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)\nA bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me\nAnd run around screamin' \"I don't care, just bite me!\" (Na-na)\nI think I was put here to annoy the world\nAnd destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl\nPlus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer\nAnd call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer (Hehe)\nFaggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay\nClaimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)\nAnd I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out\nAsk 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out\nAfter they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (Ah!)\nDucked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!\nLook at y'all runnin' your mouth again\nWhen you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10\nAnd I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females\nIn make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails\n\"Slim Anus\"? You damn right, slim anus\nI don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause I'm just Marshall\nMathers (Marshall Mathers)\nI'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out\nIf you talk about me (Talk about me)\nCome and see me on the streets alone if you assholes\nDoubt me (Assholes doubt me)\nAnd if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot\nAt me (Best shot at me)\n[Verse 2]\nIs it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?\nYou little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy\nNow because of this blonde mop that's on top\nOf this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?\nThe underground just spunned around and did a three-sixty\nNow these kids diss me and act like some big sissies\n\"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy\nSo now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy\"\nMy fuckin' bitch mom's sued me for ten-million\nShe must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'\nShit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?\nAll I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress\nWhich is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?\nIt doesn't matter, [your attorney Fred Gibson’s a] faggot\nTalkin' about I fabricated my past\nHe's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)\nSo tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?\nFor every million I make, another relative sues\nFamily fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper\nAll of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins (Hey, it's me!)\nA half-brother and sister who never seen me\nOr even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV\nNow everybody's so happy and proud\nI'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)\nAnd then to top it off I walked to the newsstand\nTo buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp\nSkipped to the last page, flipped right fast\nAnd what do I see? A picture of my big white ass\nOkay, let me give you motherfuckers some help (Uh, here!)\n\"\nXXL\n! \nXXL\n!\"\nNow your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell\nAw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm just Marshall\nMathers (Marshall Mathers)\nI'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the\nFuss about me (Fuss about me)\nNobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did\nWas doubt me (Did was doubt me)\nNow everybody wanna run they mouth and try to\nTake shots at me (Take shots at me)\nBecause I'm just Marshall\nMathers (Marshall Mathers)\nI'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the\nFuss about me (Fuss about me)\nNobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did\nWas doubt me (Did was doubt me)\nNow everybody wanna run they mouth and try to\nTake shots at me (Take shots at me)\n[Instrumental]"
