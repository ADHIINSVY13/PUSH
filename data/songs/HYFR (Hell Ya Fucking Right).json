Time for me to revisit the past\nThere's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved\nThere's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn\nInterviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nUh, so much for being optimistic\nThey say love is in the air, so I\nHold my breath 'til my face turn purple\nKeep a few bad bitches in my circle\nMy nuts hang like ain't no curfew\nBitch, if you wave, then I will surf you\nI flew jet, she flew commercial\nBut we still met later that night\nAfter my session, she came over\nI was aggressive and she was sober\nI gave her a pill, she started confessin'\nAnd started undressin' and asked me to hold her\nAnd so I did, but that was last month\nAnd now she's texting me asking for closure, damn\nShe say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper\nWe eat each other whenever we at the dinner table\nShe say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average\nShit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married\nPromises, I hope I never break 'em\nMet a female dragon, had a fire conversation\nBut interviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne & \nDrake\n]\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah\n[Outro: Drake]\nYeah\nYeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah"
