(Chicka) GOAT\nNow fling that bitch from your fingertips\nHope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit\nAnything of wit that's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?\nLet your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit\nHow low can you go? \nLower than Chuck D, ho\nHear the bassiness in my voice?\n \nRocky's back, where my Adrians?\nNobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius\nI'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots\nTo rap;\n \nI'm not a man, I'm a weapon\nWho just happened to be a rapper, who just happen to be on the crapper\nWhen it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom\nI'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-\n-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster\nSo let's eat, 'cause I'm famished, \nevery deed is a dastardly one\nEvilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-\n-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody puts baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n[Verse 3]\nSo step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like an inside of an engine\nWhile I multiply your undivided attention\nBut be reminded: if I didn't mention\nI lose my mind and my temper, you'll be the first one who finds him offensive\nGot him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction\nBut look up \"rhyme\" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture\n\"Eminem\" is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma\nFuck it, let's get to the meatballs\nI'm gonna skip the veg' and potatoes, edumacator (They are)\nShit, legends are made of, \nspit treacherous data\nShit that you would say to your worst enemy\nThis wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada\nThen combine 'em with Method Man and Redman\n \nwith metham-\n-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer\nIn pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam\nBeatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam\nMaybe I need my head exam-ed, \nHannibal Lecter with a dead lamb\nHangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan\nI need meds, swear to God, 'cause if I go off the edge\nT.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man (Ah)\nHeart-throb that'll fart, ah, nah\nMore like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-\n-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Walmart walls\nLittle baby with large balls\nFuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'\nThere's nothing on this fuckin' Earth better than bein' the\nKing of the playground, I hate the swings, but I love bein' an underdog\n'Cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah)\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody puts baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya"
