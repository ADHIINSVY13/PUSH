  "lyrics": "Tell me how you've been\nAnd tell me what you've seen\nAnd tell me that you'd like to see me too\n'Cause my heart is full of no blood\nAnd my cup is full of no love\nCouldn't take another sip even if I wanted\nBut it's not too late, hm\nIt's not too late for love\nMy lungs are out of air\nAnd yours are holding smoke\nAnd it's been like that now for so long\nAnd I've seen people try to change\nAnd I know it isn't easy\nBut nothin' worth the time ever really is\nAnd it's not too late, hm\nIt's not too late for love\nFor love\nFor love\nFor love"
