It's a shame because the man's slain\nHe got caught in the chains of his own game\nHow can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?\nSweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community\nOne day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society\nWhy did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality\nWorked me like a slave while they laid back\nHomie don't play that\n, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback\nI'm tryin' to avoid physical contact\nI can't hold back, it's time to attack, Jack\n[Chorus: 2Pac & \nShock G\n]\nThey got me trapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nYou know they got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\nTrapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nNow I'm trapped and walkin' for my getaway\nAll I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay\nCan't use the phone 'cause I'm sure someone's tapping in\nDid it before, ain't scared to use my gat again\nI look back in hindsight, the fight was irrelevant\nBut now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him\nHe shot first and I'll be damned if I run away\nHomie is done away, I should've put my gun away\nI wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule\nGirlies was laughin', Tup saying, \"Damn, homie's dissin' you\"\nFired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane\nI got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain\nGot to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood\nNow I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer\nRan through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway\nCopper say, \"Freeze, or you'll be dead today\"\nTrapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light\nThoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life\nWhat do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?\nI'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell\n[Chorus: 2Pac & \nShock G\n]\nThey got me trapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\nTrapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nYou know they got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\n\n[Outro]\nTrapped\nYo, y'all seen 2Pac, man? Y'all seen 2Pac, man?\nThere he go! Ayy 'Pac, ayy, rollers out here, Pac, we gon' bail\nLet's go, man..."
