Who would'a even thought possibly\nCupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?\nIt's true that I got shot in the heart\nBut when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are\nBut see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see\n'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach\nUp under the seat as your heart starts to beat\nBefore you make a decision that's life-altering\nAnd just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave\nYou hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring\n\n[Chorus: \nUnknown\n & Eminem]\nSpend some time with me\n,\n say that you'll be mine\n (Ha-ha)\nI never thought I'd find someone to be mine\nLord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine\n (Ha-ha)\n[Interlude: Stat Quo]\nHa, ha, yeah right, bitch\nSpend some time on my dick\n[Verse 3: Stat Quo]\nIn most cases, Stat's attitude is, \"Fuck a bitch!\"\nMy only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch\nBut you was different, thought we shared a covenant\nEven held your hand in pub-a-lic\nWe sufferin' because of this\nShawty on some whole 'nother other shit\nTryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip\nI'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit\nFeedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss\nWe started off closer than close\nBut who could've predicted to know\nYour trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?\nAnd the final result, back in that same boat\nI asked myself: \"Do I love these hoes?\" — Nope!\n\n[Verse 4: 50 Cent]\n(Yeah) Em introduced us: \"50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50\"\nThen slid off and left her to kick it with me\nI complimented her, I said, \"You have very nice lips.\"\nWith my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick\nWe played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast\nHad her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass\nDowntown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline\nPenthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind\nShe got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too\nWhy talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?\nSaid she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice\nYeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?\n (Ha-ha!)\n[Chorus: \nUnknown\n & Eminem]\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine\nI never thought I'd find someone to be mine\nLord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
