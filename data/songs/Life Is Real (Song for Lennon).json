  "lyrics": "Mercury wrote “Life Is Real” as a tribute to John Lennon, who was murdered in December of 1980. The instrumentals were meant to capture the essence of John’s work, with a melancholy, light piano arrangement.\n[Verse 1]\nGuilt stains on my pillow\nBlood on my terraces\nTorsos in my closet\nShadows from my past\n[Chorus]\nLife is real, life is real\nLife is real, so real\n[Verse 2]\nSleeping is my leisure\nWaking up in a minefield\nDream is just a pleasure dome\nLove is a roulette wheel\n[Chorus]\nLife is real, life is real\nLife is real, oh yeah\n[Bridge]\nSuccess is my breathing space\nI brought it on myself\nI will price it\nI will cash it\nI can take it or leave it\nLoneliness is my hiding place\nBreastfeeding myself\nWhat more can I say\nI have swallowed the bitter pill\nI can taste it, I can taste it\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is real, life is real\nLife is real\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 3]\nMusic will be my mistress\nLoving like a whore\nLennon is a genius\nLiving in every pore\n[Chorus]\nLife is real, life is real\nLife is real, so real\n[Outro]\nLife is cruel\nLife is a bitch\nLife is real, so real\nLife is real, life is real\nYeah, life is real"
