  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI found a guy, told me I was a star\nHe held the door, held my hand in the dark\nAnd he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face\nDoes he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?\n[Verse 2]\nAnd there's one more boy, he's from my past\nWe fell in love, but it didn't last\n'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away\nAnd I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway\nAnd I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you\n[Chorus]\nAll I want is love that lasts\nIs all I want too much to ask?\nIs it something wrong with me?\nAll I want is a good guy\nAre my expectations far too high?\nTry my best, but what can I say?\nAll I have is myself at the end of the day\nBut shouldn't that be enough for me?\n[Bridge]\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nAnd I miss the days when I was young and naive\nI thought the perfect guy would come and find me\nNow happy ever after, it don't come so easily\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I want is love that lasts\nIs all I want too much to ask?\nIs it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh\nAll I want is a good guy\nAre my expectations far too high?\nTry my best but what can I say?\nAll I have is myself at the end of the day\nAnd all I want is for that to be okay"
