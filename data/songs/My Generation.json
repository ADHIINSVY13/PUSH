We 'bout to make a change)\nThis generation will make a change\n (Yeah)\n[Verse 1: Damian Marley]\n(Boom!) Now me love fi see the schoolers them a graduate\nA-study hard, and save the party for the holidays\nDiplomatic with them diploma and them bound fi great\nBecause them nah pick up no 'matic and a-perpetrate\nAnd then I love the energies, what them a-generate\nMy generation, it so special, it will make a change\nBecause the elders sow the seed and it a-germinate\nSo anytime them see the progress, them a-celebrate\nBecause we rising up despite of the economy\nAnd then a-we a-star the show like the astronomy\nAnd how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly\nBecause we keep remaining true without apology\nThe mission have fi carry through and finish properly\nSay Gambia to Guadeloupe, Paris to Napoli\nSay Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli\nAnd everybody want a future living happily\n[Chorus: Joss Stone]\nMy generation will make a change\n (We'll make a change, we'll make a change, yeah)\nThis generation will make a change\n (This generation, yeah)\nMy generation will make a change\n (We'll make a change, we'll make a change, we'll make a change, I swear we will)\nThis generation will make a change\n (I swear it now, yeah! Hey!)\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nCan you blame my generation? Subjected gentrification\nDepicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation\n'Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing\nPlacing my life in front of your eyes for your observation\nNow if you can't relate, then maybe you are too complacent\nAthletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements\nWhat's up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?\nImprove your values, education is real power\nI reach 'em like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow\nAdd some bravado, get wealthy like Wells Fargo\nIt's truth that I am you and I am proof\nSurviving through, we do what we gotta do\nYo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you\nThen maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school\n'Cause there's a mission, we gotta finish before we leave\nThis generation is destined to do historic deeds\n[Chorus: Joss Stone]\nMy generation will make a change\n (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nThis generation will make a change\n (My generation, this generation, yeah)\nMy generation will make a change\n (We'll make a change, we'll make a change, we'll make a change, yeah)\nThis generation will make a change\n (This generation now, hey!)\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nIf you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun\nBeen a long time coming, I know change gon' come (\nWe're makin' a change\n)\nMan, I gotta keep it moving to the beat of my drum\nLast night, I set the future at the feet of my son\nBut they thinking that my generation gotta die young\nIf we all come together, then they can't divide one\nDon't worry 'bout it, just be about it\nGot a message from God: \"Heaven too crowded\"\nBut I say, \"Hey, young world, you never looked better\nAnd I heard change start with the man in the mirror,\" uh\nThis generation, I'mma represent\nA generation led by a black president\nNow how's that for change? Who knew that can change?\nI donâ€™t even look at the flag the same, heck\nUh, so when you finish reading Revelations (Revelations)\nThank God for my generation\n\n[Chorus: Joss Stone]\nMy generation will make a change, yes\nThis generation will make a change, yeah\nMy generation will make a change for good, for better\nThis generation will make a change, yeah"
