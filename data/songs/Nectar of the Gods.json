Honey on the vine\nSchool kid dreams came true, then passed in the night\nI used to dream about people like you, now I don’t know why\nI used to sing about people like you, now I just get high\n[Chorus]\nI get wild on you, baby\nI get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew\nI get wild on you, baby\nI get wild and \nfuckin' crazy\n like \nthe color blue\n, ooh-ooh\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n[Chorus]\nI get wild on you, baby\nI get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, ooh, ooh\nI get \nwild\n on you, baby\nI get \nwild\n and fuckin' crazy like \nthe color blue\n, ooh-ooh\n[Outro]\nCaliforn-I-A, homeland of the Gods\nOnce I found my way, but now I am lost"
