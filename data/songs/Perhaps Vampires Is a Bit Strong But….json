What on earth's the plan\nHas he got one?\"\nYou better give me some pointers\nSince you are the big rocket launcher\nAnd I'm just the shotgun\nI ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes\nThat might be a surprise\nBut it's true, \nsaid, I'm not like you\nAnd I don't want your advice or your praise\nOr to move in the ways you do\nAnd I never will\n[Chorus: Alex Turner]\n'Cause all you people are vampires\nAnd all your stories are stale\nAnd though you pretend to stand by us\nI know you're certain we'll fail\n[Verse 2: Alex Turner, \nAlex Turner & Matt Helders\n]\nI've seen your eyes as they fix on me\nFull of confusion\nYour snarl is just so condescending\nTrying to explain that we're on to a win\nIf the fee we get in\nNear recoups what we're spendin'\nHe said, \n\"I can't believe\n that you drove all that way\nWell how much did they pay ya?\nHow much did they pay ya?\nYou'd have been better to stay round our way\"\nThinkin' 'bout things\nBut not actually doing the things\n\n[Chorus: Alex Turner, \nAlex Turner & Matt Helders\n]\n'Cause all you people are vampires\nAnd all your stories are stale\nAnd though you pretend to stand by us\nI know you're certain we'll fail\n'Cause all you people are vampires\nAnd all your stories are stale\nAnd though you pretend to stand by us\nI know you're certain we'll fail\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Interlude: Matt Helders]\n(All you people are vampires)\n[Instrumental Outro]"
