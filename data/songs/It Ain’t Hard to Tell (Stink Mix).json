  "lyrics": "[Produced by Dave Scratch]\n[Verse 1]\nIt ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail\nThe mic is contacted, I attract clientele\nMy mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath\nI exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps\nDeep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond\nSneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining\nHit the Earth like a comet – invasion!\nNas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing\nCause in my physical, I can express through song\nDelete stress like Motrin, then extend strong\nI drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell\nFrom the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell\n[Verse 2]\nThe Buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up\nNot stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up\nNas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L\nSchool a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell\nI kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill\nVocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic\nI freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik\nJam like a Tec with correct techniques\nSo analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me\nScannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me\nI leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose\nNas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen\nI'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen\nSpeak with criminal slang, begin like a violin\nEnd like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again\nWisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop\nI dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles\nStreet's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle\nAnd groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova\nYou're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra\nPacking like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks\nMC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak\nMy poetry's deep I never fail\nNas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell\n[Outro Scratches]\nThe type of lyrical terrorism I present"
