  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIs it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?\nI'm not cut out for all these cynical clones\nThese hunters with cell phones\n[Chorus]\nTake me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die\nI don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you\nThose Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry\nI'm setting off, but not without my muse\n[Verse 2]\nWhat should be over, burrowed under my skin\nIn heart-stopping waves of hurt\nI've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze\nTell me what are my words worth\n[Chorus]\nTake me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die\nI don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you\nThose Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry\nI'm setting off, but not without my muse\n[Bridge]\nI want auroras and sad prose\nI want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet\n'Cause I haven't moved in years\nAnd I want you right here\nA red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground\nWith no one around to tweet it\nWhile I bathe in cliffside pools\nWith my calamitous love and insurmountable grief\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die\nI don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you\nThose Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry\nI'm setting off, but not without my muse\nNo, not without you"
