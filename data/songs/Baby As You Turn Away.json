  "lyrics": "Here am I one sad and lonely guy\nOne shadow of the man I used to be\nNow it's past, the love I thought would last\nYou thought I had you chained\nAnd now you're free\nI know it's wrong but I'm still holding on\nStill praying you will soon come back to me\nBut then you go, you let your feelings show\nYou said I gave you pain, and now I see\nBut baby, as you turn away\nI will always think of what we had together\nBaby, this is just your way of breaking my heart\nAnd it's easier to say goodbye\nMaking me fall, making me try, try to make\nYou stay as you turn away\nNow you're gone, this road I walk upon is just\nAnother place where I can hide\nI'm still your man\nThere's proof of who I am\nExcept without your love I'm dead inside\n\nBut baby, as you turn away\nI will always think of what we had together\nBaby, this is just your way of breaking my heart\nAnd it's easier to say goodbye\nMaking me fall, watching me try, try to make\nYou stay as you turn away"
