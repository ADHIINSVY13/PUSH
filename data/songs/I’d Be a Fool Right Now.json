  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey say your love will surely fade girl\nWhen things go wrong and trouble calls\nBut they don't know that your sweet sunshine babe\nWill never fade when darkness falls\nThey say that when the chips are down girl\nYour love won't stay so long my friend\nBut they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe\nHas been around through thick and thin\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nIf I should hurt you girl\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nIf I should leave you girl\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nIf I wouldn't love you girl\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nOn the outside looking inside\n[Verse 2]\nThey say your love is surely goin'\nJust like a snowman in the sun\nBut they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe\nWas here when all my friends were gone\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nIf I should hurt you girl\nOh, such a fool right now\nIf I should leave you girl\nBaby, baby, a fool right now\nIf I wouldn't love you girl\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nOn the outside lookin' inside\n[Bridge]\nAll my dreams would fall and crumble into dirt\nIf I walk away from you I'd be the one to hurt\n[Verse 3]\nOne day my dreams were surely dying, dying, dying baby\nJust like a flower without rain\nThey just don't know that your sweet sunshine babe\nMade my life blossom again\nAnd so the story goes around baby yeah y-yeah\nThat this is just a passing thing\nBut I believe in your sweet lovin', lovin'... babe\nWith every summer fallin' rain\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nIf I should hurt you girl\nOh, such a fool right now\nIf I should leave you girl\nI'd be a fool right now\nIf I wouldn't love you girl\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nOh, hey!\n\nAnd I'd be a fool right now\nIf I should hurt you girl\nOh, such a fool right now\nIf I should leave you girl\nBaby, baby, a fool right now"
