  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nOnce upon a Christmas Eve\nA shepherd who believed\nThat peace could come to any man\nMade a promise to the star above\nThe day that love began\n[Verse 1]\nI will give to him my lamb\nA shepherd's all I am\nAnd so he walked the lonely sand\nTo find the place his heart was dreaming of\nThe day that love began\n[Bridge]\nOver meadows, over mountains\nThey came from valleys and from streams\nEvery poet and every king\nAnd one little shepherd with a dream\n[Verse 2]\nBut as the shepherd knelt to pray\nHis lamb just ran away\nAnd tear drops filled his empty hand\nHe broke his promise to a star above\nThe day that love began\n\n[Bridge]\nThen the smiling face of Mary\nBeckoned the shepherd to her side\nToday, you gave Him the best gift of all\nThe moment that you cried\n[Chorus]\nOh, once upon a Christmas Eve\nA shepherd who believed\nThat peace could come to an-any man\nFound the place his heart was dreaming of\nAnd he kept his promise to a star above\nThe day that love began, mmm, mmm-hmm"
