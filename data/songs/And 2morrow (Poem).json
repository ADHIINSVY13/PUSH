  "lyrics": "pages 140 & 141\nToday is filled with anger\nFueled with hidden hate\nScared of being outcast\nAfraid of common fate\nToday is built on tragedies\nwhich no one wants 2 face\nNightmares 2 humanities\nand morally disgraced\nTonight is filled with rage\nViolence in the air\nChildren bred with ruthlessness\nBecause no one at home cares\nTonight I lay my head down\nBut the pressure never stops\ngnawing at my sanity\ncontent when I am dropped\nBut 2morrow I c change\nA chance 2 build anew\nBuilt on spirit, intent of heart\nand ideals based on truth\nAnd 2morrow I wake with second wind\nAnd strong because of pride\n2 know I fought with all my heart 2 keep my dream alive"
