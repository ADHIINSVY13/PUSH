Ooh\nHow far would I travel to be where you are?\nHow far is the journey from here to a star?\nAnd if I'd ever lost you, how much would I cry?\nHow deep is the ocean? Baby, how high is the sky?\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nOoh, ooh, how far would I travel to be where you are?\nHow far is the journey from here to a star?\nAnd if I'd ever lost you, how much would I cry?\nHow deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?"
