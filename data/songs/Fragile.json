  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMore fragile than life\nAnd easier to destroy\nAnd faster to dissolve\nAnd cheaper to avoid\nAnd riskier to control\nAnd not so forgiving\nMore fragile than life\nIs living\n[Verse 2]\nMore fragile than time\nAnd tougher to tell\nAnd simpler to kill\nOh, and deeper to dwell\nAnd quicker to plash\nWhen both hands are climbing\nMore fragile than time\nIs timing\n[Verse 3]\nMore fragile than you\nAnd sweeter inside\nAnd sadder to leave\nOh, unidentified\nAnd sooner to fade\nAnd harder to trust\nMore fragile than you\nIs us"
