  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's blood on the side of the mountain\nThere's writing all over the wall\nShadows of us are still dancin'\nIn every room and every hall\nThere's snow fallin' over the city\nYou thought that it would wash away\nThe bitter taste of my fury\nAnd all of the messes you made\nYeah, you think that you got away\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze\nMy footsteps on the ground\nYou'll see my face in every place\nBut you can't catch me now\nThrough wading grass, the months will pass\nYou'll feel it all around\nI'm here, I'm there, I'm evеrywhere\nBut you can't catch me now\nNo, you can't catch mе now\n[Verse 2]\nBet you thought I'd never do it\nThought it'd go over my head\nI bet you figured I'd pass with the winter\nBe somethin' easy to forget\nOh, you think I'm gone 'cause I left\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze\nMy footsteps on the ground\nYou'll see my face in every place\nBut you can't catch me now\nThrough wading grass, the months will pass\nYou'll feel it all around\nI'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere\nBut you can't catch me now\nNo, you can't catch me now\n[Post-Chorus]\nOoh\nOoh\nOoh\nOoh\n[Bridge]\nYou can't, you can't catch me now\nI'm comin' like a storm into your town\nYou can't, you can't catch me now\nI'm higher than the hopes that you brought down\nYou can't, you can't catch me now\nI'm comin' like a storm into your town\nYou can't, you can't catch me now\nI'm higher than the hopes that you brought down\nYou can't, you can't catch me now\nI'm comin' like a storm into your town\nYou can't, you can't catch me now\nYou can't, you can't, you can't\n\n[Outro]\nThere's blood on the side of the mountain\nIt's turning a new shade of red\nYeah, sometimes the fire you founded\nDon't burn the way you'd expect\nYeah, you thought that this was the end"
