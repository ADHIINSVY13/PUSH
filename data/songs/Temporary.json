Where's she at?\nThis ain't Hailie\nWho is it?\nIt's a monster\n (Ahh)\n[Verse 1: Skylar Grey, \nHailie Jade\n & \nEminem\n]\nI've been waiting all night for the sunrise\nTo take away the dark sky\nYou the dad monster and them are the baby monsters and I'm the mom monster\n (\nOh\n)\nAll it takes is a new day sometimes\nTo get me in a better state of mind\nGive me a kiss, monster, give me a kiss\nLove you\n (\nI love you\n)\n[Pre-Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nIf I could just fall asleep\nI'd be lost in a dream\nBut right now, it's misery\nAnd I just have to remember\n\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nThat when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever\nThe pieces will grow back together\nAnd in time, I'll be fine\nThe tears are temporary\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nYeah, so Hailie Jade, I wrote you this song\nTo help you cope with life now that I'm gone\nHow should I start? Just wanna say\nLook after Alaina, Stevie, and Uncle Nate\nAnd, sweetie, be strong, I know I was your rock\nAnd I still am, saying goodbye is just not\nEver easy, but why you crying? Just stop\nHailie, baby, dry your eye, this is not\nForever\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nThat when a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever\nThe pieces will grow back together\nAnd in time, I'll be fine\nThe tears are temporary\n[Post-Chorus: Hailie Jade, \nSkylar Grey\n, \nEminem\n & \nKim Scott\n]\nDaddy (\nOoh\n)\nWhat?\n (\nOoh\n)\nWhen, I used to have this when I was a little kid (\nOoh\n)\nBaby, are you okay?\n (\nOoh\n)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nYeah, and you will get over me and move on\nYou can play me on repeat on a song\nBut don't you dare shed a tear, what'd I tell you?\n\"Straighten up, little soldier,\" them times when I held you\nJade, it'll be okay, baby, I'm here, hey\nI'm watching you right now, baby girl, I vow\nI will protect you, your guardian angel\nAs hard as this may feel, us parting is painful\nAnd, darling, the rain will, drive you insane, still\nYou will remain strong, Hailie, just hang on\nIt won't be too long, I need you to move on\nAnd remember, it will get better\n'Cause time heals and when a\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nWhen a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever\nThe pieces will grow back together\nAnd in time, I'll be fine\nThe tears are temporary\nThe bad days will start to get better\nThen we'll be laughin' together\nAnd tonight, when I cry\nThe tears are temporary\n[Post-Chorus: Eminem, \nSkylar Grey\n & \nHailie Jade\n]\nI know this big girl (\nOoh\n)\nAnd she's really pretty (\nOoh\n)\nYou know what her name is?\nHailie\n (\nOoh\n)\nHailie, how did you know? (\nOoh\n)\n'Cause\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem & \nHailie Jade\n]\nYeah, and if there's days where you wanna just lock yourself in your room and cry\nJust think about how when you were little, how you and I\nBack and forth to the studio, we used to drive\nYou strapped in the backseat 'cause you were my\nLittle sidekick, yeah, sweetie, I know this hurts\nBean, I'm wishing your pain away\nRemember this, Hailie Jade\nThere's gonna be rainy days\nI promise you'll get through 'em and make it regardless\nFuck\n it, Jade, I'll be honest\nI knew that you was gonna take this the hardest\nSweetie, get up, I know that this is breaking your heart, it's\nThe hardest thing I've ever wrote (\nDaddy\n)\nHailie, sweetheart, it's okay for you to let me go\nBaby, I promise you that when a\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nWhen a heart breaks, it ain't broken forever\nThe pieces will grow back together\nAnd in time, I'll be fine\nThe tears are temporary\nThe bad days will start to get better\nThen we'll be laughin' together\nAnd tonight when I cry\nThe tears are temporary\n[Post-Chorus: Eminem, \nSkylar Grey\n & \nHailie\n Jade\n]\nWhat's your favorite song?
