  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSmile though your heart is breaking\nSmile even though it's aching\nWhen there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by\nIf you smile through your fear and sorrow\nSmile and maybe tomorrow\nYou'll see the sun come shining through for you\n[Verse 2]\nLight up your face with gladness\nHide every trace of sadness\nAlthough a tear may be ever so near\nThat's the time you must keep on trying\nSmile, what's the use of crying?\nYou'll see that life is still worthwhile\nIf you just smile\n[Bridge]\nDo-do-do-do-do-do\nDa-da-da-da-da-do-do\nDa-bo-da-ba-ba-ba-da-bo\nDa-da-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da\nBa-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da\n[Outro]\nYou'll see that life is still worthwhile\nIf you just smile"
