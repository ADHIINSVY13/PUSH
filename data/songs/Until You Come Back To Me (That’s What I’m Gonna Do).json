  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThough you don't call anymore\nI sit and wait in vain\nI guess I'll rap on your door\nTap on your window pane\nI want to tell you, baby\nThe changes I've been going through\nMissing you\n[Chorus]\nUntil you come back to me\nThat's what I'm gonna do\n[Verse 2]\nWhy did you have to decide\nYou had to set me free, yeah\nI'm gonna swallow my pride\nAnd beg you to please see me\nI'm gonna walk by myself\nTo prove that my love is true\nAll for you\n[Chorus]\nUntil you come back to me\nThat's what I'm gonna do\n\n[Bridge]\nLiving for you, my dear\nIs like living in a world of constant fear\nHear my plea, I've got to make you see\nThat our love is dying\n[Verse 3]\nAlthough your phone you ignore\nSomehow I must explain\nI'll have to rap on your door\nTap on your window pane\nI'm gonna camp on your steps\nUntil I get through to you\nChange your view\n[Chorus]\nUntil you come back to me\nThat's what I'm gonna do\nOh, 'til you come back to me\nThat's what I'm gonna do\n[Outro]\nI'm gonna tap on your window pane (Knock on your door, tap on your window pane)\nDon't wanna wait in vain\nI'm gonna tap on your window pane (Knock on your door, tap on your window pane)"
