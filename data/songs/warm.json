Am I just on your to-do-list?\nI promise either way\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you dare, meet me there\nI'll be higher than the exosphere\n'Cause I know now, I'm safe and sound\nAnd I won't come down for you\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm cool ('Cause I'm cool)\nOn my own (On my own)\nBut it's warmer\nIn your arms, mm\n'Cause it's nice to unravel, tears, how they travel\nHappy ones tonight\n'Cause it's warm\nIn your arms\n[Bridge]\nIt's so good, it's so close, I can taste it\nOn my lips, this is your invitation\nIf you dare, meet me up here\nMeet me up here\nThere's only this, this\nIt's so good, it's so close, I can taste it (Close to you)\nOn my lips, this is your invitation (Close to you)\nIf you dare, meet me up here (If you dare)\nMeet me up here\nThere's only this\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm cool (It's so good, it's so close, I can taste it)\nOn my own, mm (On my lips, this is your invitation)\nBut it's warmer (If you dare, meet me up here)\nIn your arms, oh\n'Cause it's nice to unravel, tears, how they travel\nHappy ones tonight\n'Cause it's warm, 'cause it's warm\nIn your arms"
