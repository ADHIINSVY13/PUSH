  "lyrics": "She's a fool and don't I know it?\nBut a fool can have her charms\nI'm in love and don't I show it?\nLike a babe in arms\nLove's the same old sad sensation\nLately, I've not slept a wink\nSince this silly situation\nHas me on the blink\nI'm wild again, beguiled again\nA simpering, whimpering child again\nBewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I\nCouldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep\nThen love came and told me I shouldn't sleep\nBewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I\nLost my heart, but what of it?\nShe is cold, I agree\nShe might laugh, but I love it\nAlthough the laugh's on me\nI'll sing to her, bring spring to her\nAnd long for the day when I'll cling to her\nBewitched, bothered and bewildered am I"
