(ooh)\nIt was so long ago and so much has changed (ooh)\nI wanna go back (go back...ooh)\nWanna go back to those simple days (ooh)\nI wanna go back (go back...ooh)\nBut now we've grown and gone our separate ways (aah)\n[Chorus]\nTimes is hard (times is hard)\nAnd things are a-changin'\nI pray to God\nThat we can remain the same\nAll I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change\nNo it don't have to change\n[Verse 2]\nDo you remember (ooh)\nBack at Grannie's house on Christmas Day? (ooh)\nHelp me sing...\nDo you remember (ooh)\nHow we'd gather 'round and sing all day? (ooh)\nAnd I wanna go back (go back...ooh)\nTo playing basketball and football games\nI wanna go back (go back...ooh)\nTo yesterday but it's not the same (aah)\n\n[Chorus]\nTimes is hard (times is hard)\nAnd things are a-changin'\nI pray to God\nThat we can remain the same\nAll I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change\nNo it don't have to change (aah)\nTimes is hard (times is hard)\nAnd things are a-changin'\nI pray to God\nThat we can remain the same\nAll I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change\nNo it don't have to change"
