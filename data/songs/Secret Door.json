  "lyrics": "“Secret Door” is the fourth track from Arctic Monkeys' 2009 album Humbug.\n\nIt has been speculated that the female character described in the song is Alexa Chung, songwriter Alex Turner’s then-girlfriend.\n[Intro]\nFools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes\nThat you would rather be beside than in front of\nBut she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares\n[Verse 1]\nShe swam out of tonight's phantasm\nGrabbed my hand and made it very clear\nThere's absolutely nothing for us here\nIt's a magnolia celebration\nTo be attended on a Wednesday night\nIt's better than to get a reputation\nAs a miserable little tyke\nAt least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture\n[Chorus]\nAnd the secret door swings behind us\nShe's saying nothing, she's just giggling along\n[Verse 2]\nHer arms were folded most indignant\nNot looking like she was soon to leave\nI had to squint in order to believe\nThen like a butler pushing on a bookshelf\nAnd unveiling the unexpected\nI, who was earlier reluctant\nWas suddenly embarrassed and corrected\nHow could such a creature survive in such a habitat?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the secret door swings behind us\nShe's saying nothing, she's just giggling along\nEven if they were to find us\nI wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied\n[Bridge]\nAs all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes\nOnes you would rather be beside than in front of\nBut she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares\nFools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze\nTurn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence\nBut you're daft to think she'd care\n[Outro]\nFools on parade\nFools on parade\nFools on parade\nConduct a sing-along"
