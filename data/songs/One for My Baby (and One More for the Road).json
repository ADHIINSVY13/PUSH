  "lyrics": "It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place\nExcept you and me\nSo set 'em' up Joe\n, I got a little story\nI think you should know\nWe're drinking my friend, to the end\nOf a brief episode\nMake it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\nI know the routine, \nput another nickel\nIn the machine\nI feel kind of bad, can't you make the music\nEasy and sad\nI could tell you a lot, but it's not\nIn a gentleman's code\nMake it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\nYou'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet\nAnd I've got a lot of things to say\nAnd when I'm gloomy, \nplease listen to me\nTill it's talked away\nThat's how it goes, and Joe I know your gettin'\nPretty anxious to close\nThanks for the cheer\nI hope you didn't mind\nMy bending your ear\nThis torch that I found\n, It must be drowned\nOr it's soon it might explode\nMake it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\n\nMake it one two three more\nMake it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\nMake it one more"
