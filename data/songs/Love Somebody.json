Yeah\n[Chorus]\nEvery time I think I love somebody\nAlways find a way to throw it all away\nI don't ever wanna hurt nobody\nI don't wanna be the one to say\nThat we gotta have a conversation\nI don't wanna watch the tears roll down your face\nNo, I hurt you and I, I'm sorry\nAll I wanted was to love somebody\n[Post-Chorus]\nWhy do I do this?\nPick you up and put you down and put you through this\n\n[Verse]\nStarted off as a good thing, a sure thing\nYou held back, but I know\nIn the moment our lips touched\nThe rush sent us straight to the moon\nI should've known that we'd be coming down\nRight to the bottom where we are now, mmm\nStarted off as a good thing, a sure thing\nWhat the hell did I do?

(Every time I think I love somebody)\nPick you up and put you down and put you through this (Always find a way to throw it all away)\nWhy do I do this? (I don't ever wanna hurt nobody)\nPick you up and put you down and put you through this (I don't wanna be the one to say)\n\n[Outro]\nThat we gotta have a conversation\nI don't wanna watch the tears roll down your face\nNo, I hurt you and I, I'm sorry\nAll I wanted was to love somebody"
