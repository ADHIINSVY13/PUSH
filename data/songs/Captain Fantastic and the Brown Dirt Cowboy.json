  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCaptain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero\nJust someone his mother might know\nVery clearly a case for corn flakes and classics\n\"Two teas both with sugar please\", in the back of an alley\nWhile little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles\nSweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer\nFor it's hay make and \"Hey mom\nDo the papers say anything good?\nAre there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys?\nShould I make my way out of my home in the woods?\"\n[Chorus 1]\nBrown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing\nCity slick Captain\nFantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding\nFor there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter\nBroken young children on the wheels of the winners\nAnd the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning\n[Chorus 2]\nFor cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range\nToo hot for the band with a desperate desire for change\nWe've thrown in the towel too many times\nOut for the count and when we're down\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\nFrom the end of the world to your town\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us\nHmm, couldn't fool us\nFor we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire\nHand in hand went music and the rhyme\nThe Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring\nFrom here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb\n[Chorus 2]\nFor cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range\nToo hot for the band with a desperate desire for change\nWe've thrown in the towel too many times\nOut for the count and when we're down\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\nFrom the end of the world to your town\nFor cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range\nToo hot for the band with a desperate desire for change\nWe've thrown in the towel too many times\nOut for the count and when we're down\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\nFrom the end of the world to your town\n[Outro]\nWe've thrown in the towel too many times\nOut for the count and when we're down\nCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\nFrom the end of the world to your town"
