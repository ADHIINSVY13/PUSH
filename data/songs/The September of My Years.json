  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOne day you turn around and it's summer\nNext day you turn around and it's fall\nAnd the springs and the winters of a lifetime\nWhatever happened to them all?\n[Chorus]\nAs a man who has always had the wand'ring ways\nNow I'm reaching back for yesterdays\n'Til a long-forgotten love appears\nAnd I find that I'm sighing softly as I near\nSeptember, the warm September of my years\n[Verse 2]\nAs a man who has never paused at wishing wells\nNow, I'm watching children's carousels\nAnd their laughter's music to my ears\nAnd I find that I'm smiling gently as I near\nSeptember, the warm September of my years\nThe golden, warm September of my years"
