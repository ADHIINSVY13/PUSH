  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEach place I go only the lonely go\nSome little small caf√©\nThe songs I know only the lonely know\nEach melody recalls a love that used to be\n[Verse 2]\nThe dreams I dream only the lonely dream\nOf lips as warm as May\nThat hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme\nThat soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care\n[Verse 3]\nAnd you recall each fun time\nThose picnics at the beach when love was new\nIt well could be the one time\nA hopeless, little dream like that comes true\n[Verse 4]\nIf you find love, hang on to each caress\nAnd never let love go\nFor when it's gone, you'll know the loneliness\nThe heartbreak only the lonely know"
