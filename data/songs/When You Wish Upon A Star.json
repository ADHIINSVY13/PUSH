  "lyrics": "When a star is born\nThey possess a gift or two\nOne of them is this:\nThey have the power to make a dream come true\nWhen you wish upon a star\nMakes no difference who you are\nAnything your heart desires\nWill come to you\nIf your heart is in your dreams\nNo request is too extreme\nWhen you wish upon a star\nAs dreamers do\nFate is kind\nShe brings to those who love\nThe sweet fulfillment of\nTheir secret longings, oh yeah\nLike a bolt out of the blue\nFate steps in and sees you through\nWhen you wish upon a star\nYour dreams come true\nWhen you wish upon a star"
