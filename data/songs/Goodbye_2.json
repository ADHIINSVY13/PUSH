  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wanted you for life\nYou and me\nIn the wind\nI never thought there come a time\nThat our story would end\nIt's hard to understand\nBut I guess I'll have to try\n[Chorus]\nIt's not easy\nTo say goodbye\n[Verse 2]\nFor all the joy we shared\nAll that time we had to spend\nNow if I had one wish\nI'd want forever back again\nTo look into your eyes\nAnd hold you when you cry\n[Chorus]\n[Bridge]\nI can remember all those great times we had\nThere were so many memories, some good some bad\nYes and through it all\nThose memories will last\nForever\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's peace in where you are\nMay be all I need to know\nAnd if I listen to my heart\nI'll hear your laughter once more\nAnd so I got to say\nI'm just glad you came my way\n[Chorus]\n[Outro]\nGoodbye"
