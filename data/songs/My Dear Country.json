  "lyrics": "'Twas Halloween and the ghosts were out\nAnd everywhere they'd go, they'd shout\nAnd though I covered my eyes I knew\nThey'd go away\nBut fear's the only thing I saw\nAnd three days later was clear to all\nThat nothing is as scary as Election Day\nBut the day after is darker\nAnd darker and darker it goes\nWho knows? Maybe the plans will change\nWho knows? \nMaybe he's not deranged\nThe newsmen know what they know, but they\nKnow even less than what they say\nAnd I don't know who I can trust\nFor they come what may\n'Cause we believed in our candidate\nBut even more, it's the one we hate\nI needed someone I could shake\nOn Election Day\nBut the day after is darker\nAnd deeper and deeper we go\nWho knows? Maybe it's all a dream\nWho knows if I'll wake up and scream\n\nI love the things that you've given me\nI cherish you, my dear country\nBut sometimes I don't understand\nThe way we play\nI love the things that you've given me\nAnd most of all that I am free\nTo have a song that I can sing\nOn Election Day"
