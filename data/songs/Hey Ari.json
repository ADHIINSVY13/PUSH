No\nYour lovesick attitude\nIt doesn't make you cool\nHey Ari, are you really happy?\nI say, \"Yeah, for sure\"\n[Outro]\nOh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, for sure\nOh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, for sure\nOh-oh-oh-oh, for sure\nYeah, for sure, yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure\nYeah, for sure, yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure\nYeah, for sure, yeah, for sure, yeah, for sure\nAre you happy?\nI say, \"Yeah, for sure\""
