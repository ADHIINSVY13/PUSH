(Fuck is ass your on?)\nI feel so alone (Yuh)\nPlease, don't come and find me (Please)\nBaby, baby\n\n[Verse 1]\nFuck is your ass on?\nNigga, fuck is your backbone?\nBack to back, we got back and forths\nAnd you wilin' like you on bath salts\nWish you really would touch me\nRemember when you would touch me, baby?\nWay to make me feel ugly\nHundred million would fuck with me, like\nGot me Cardi B’in’, like what was the reason?\nWas it your demons? Was it the cheatin'?\nOr was it you readin’ all through my feed and texts?\nBaby, we not playin' Simon Says\nTell me to shut up, I'll find your bags\nI just don't live a lifestyle fit for\nThe childish shit that you ridin’ wit'\n[Chorus]\nTell me, baby\nWhy you leave me all alone\nWhen you talkin' to me?\nHow you leave me all alone\nWhen you're right beside me?\nI feel so alone\nPlease, don't come and find me\nBaby, baby\nTell me, baby\nWhy you leave me all alone\nWhen you talking to me?\nHow you leave me all alone\nWhen you're right beside me?\nI feel so alone\nPlease, don't come and find me (\nSo long\n)\nBaby, baby\n\n[Outro]\nCall me, baby\nDon't you call me, baby\nI'm not lonely, baby\nI'm not lonely, baby\nCall me, baby\nDon't call me, baby\nI'm not lonely anymore"
