  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou're not a ship to carry my life\nYou are nailed to my love in many lonely nights\nI've strayed from the cottages and found myself here\nFor I need your love, your love protects my fears\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind\nBut I need you to turn to when I act so blind\nAnd I need you to turn to when I lose control\nYou're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold\n[Verse 2]\nDid you paint your smile on? Well, I said I knew\nThat my reason for living was for loving you\nWe're related in feeling but you're high above\nYou're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind\nBut I need you to turn to when I act so blind\nAnd I need you to turn to when I lose control\nYou're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold"
