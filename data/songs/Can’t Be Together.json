  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou've got your eye on me after all these years\nYou think that I can't see you from over here\nI may be out of your view, but I can hear you\nI may be out of the room, but I can see you\nI know you still want me, you always will\nAnd I can guarantee I know just how it feels\nTo never be free completely\nSometimes you just feel so empty\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike lately when I have been missing you\nAnd I would still do anything for you\n[Chorus]\nBut we need to learn how to love who we're loving\nIt's hard but we must we've got to let it go\nAnd turn off the urge to know what could have been\nBut I will love you forever\n[Verse 2]\nI was far too reckless, I know that now\nTrying to make you jealous made me feel proud\nBut now I'm in too deep to climb out\nBut know that I live with my doubt, oh-oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike lately when I have been missing you\nAnd I want to do everything with you\n[Chorus]\nBut we need to learn how to love who we're loving\nIt's hard but we must, we've got to let it go\nAnd turn off the urge to know what could have been\nBut I will love you forever\n[Bridge]\nSince we were together everybody's changed\nOur reflections in the mirror no longer look the same\nAnd we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make\nBut I will always miss you at the end of each day\n[Chorus]\nBut we need to learn how to love who we're loving\nIt's hard but we must, we've got to let it go\nAnd turn off the urge to know what could have been\nMy love, let's learn how to love who we're loving\nIt's so hard but we must, we've got to let it go\nAnd turn off the urge to know what could have been\nBut I will love you forever\n[Outro]\nBut we can't be together\nNo, we won't be together"
