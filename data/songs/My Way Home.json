  "lyrics": "[Produced by Kanye West]\n[Intro: Common & \nGil Scott-Heron\n]\nYeah\nI'm on my way home\n[Verse: Common]\nThey say home is where the hate is,\n \nmy dome is where fate is\nI stroll where souls get lost like Vegas\nSeen through the eyes of rebel glasses\nPray to God that my arms reach the masses\nThe young smoke grass in grassless jungles\nRubber band together in cashless bundles\nWe wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains\nMakin' sense of it, we hustle for change\nRevolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'\nSomeone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson\nHypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell\nDon't he know he could only get as high as he fell?\nShow money becomes bail, relationships become jail\nChildren are unheld\nI wish love was for sale\n, \n\"Behold the Pale - Horse\"\nGot me trapped like R. Kel'\n, I bail and itâ€”\n[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]\nMight not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again\nI'm on my way home\nI left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone\nHome is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it\nMight not be such a bad idea if I never\nNever went home again"
