  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nThere's a hole in the world tonight\nThere's a cloud of fear and sorrow\nThere's a hole in the world tonight\nDon't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow\n[Verse 1]\nThey say that anger is just love disappointed\nThey say that love is just a state of mind\nBut all this fighting over who will be anointed\nOh, how can people be so blind\n[Chorus]\n[Verse 2]\nOh, they tell me there's a place over yonder\nCool water running through the burning sand\nUntil we learn to love one another\nWe will never reach the promise land\n[Chorus][x6]"
