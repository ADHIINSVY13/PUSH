  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room\nAnd if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too\nEven on my worst day, did I deserve, babe\nAll the hell you gave me?\n'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you\n'Til my dying day\n[Chorus]\nI didn't have it in myself to go with grace\nAnd you're the hero flying around, saving face\nAnd if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?\nCursing my name, wishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet\n[Verse 2]\nWe gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean\nSome to throw, some to make a diamond ring\nYou know I didn't want to have to haunt you\nBut what a ghostly scene\nYou wear the same jewels that I gave you\nAs you bury me\n[Chorus]\nI didn't have it in myself to go with grace\n'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave\nAnd if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?\nCursing my name, wishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I can go anywhere I want\nAnywhere I want, just not home\nAnd you can aim for my heart, go for blood\nBut you would still miss me in your bones\nAnd I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)\nAnd when you can't sleep at night\n \n(You hear my stolen lullabies)\n[Chorus]\nI \ndidn't have it in myself to go with grace\nAnd so the battleships will sink beneath the waves\nYou had to kill me, but it killed you just the same\nCursing my name, wishing I stayed\nYou turned into your worst fears\nAnd you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain\nCrossing out the good years\nAnd you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet"
