  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen will I see you again?\nYou left with no goodbye, not a single word was said\nNo final kiss to seal any sins\nI had no idea of the state we were in\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness\nAnd a wandering eye,\n \nand a heaviness in my head\n[Chorus]\nBut don't you remember?\nDon't you remember?\nThe reason you loved me before\nBaby, please remember me once more\n[Verse 2]\nWhen was the last time that you thought of me?\nOr have you completely erased me from your memory?\nI often think about where I went wrong\nThe more I do, the less I know\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness\nAnd a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't you remember?\nDon't you remember?\nThe reason you loved me before\nBaby, please remember me once more\n[Bridge]\nGave you the space so you could breathe\nI kept my distance so you would be free\nIn hope that you'd find the missing piece\nTo bring you back to me\n[Chorus]\nWhy don't you remember?\nDon't you remember?\nThe reason you loved me before\nBaby, please remember me once more\n[Outro]\nWhen will I see you again?"
