You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis!\nYou will not walk 'cross that stage, you won’t slide across that stage!\nMotherfucker can’t pull you 'cross that muthafuckin' stage, Kanye!\nWho told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting!\nI’m tryna get you out here with these white people and this how you're gon' do me?\nYou know what, you's a nigga, and I don’t mean that in no nice way\nHad lil' kids sing about the shit—y'know, the joke's on you\nYou throw your motherfucking hands in the air and wave goodbye to every-motherfucking-body! 'Cause, you getting the fuck out of this campus!\nWhat the fuck you gon' do now?\n[Verse: John Legend]\nI'm no longer confused, but, don't tell anybody\nI'm about to break the rules, but, don't tell anybody\nI got something better than school, so don't tell anybody\nMy momma would kill me, so, don't tell anybody\nShe wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody\nShe ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody"
