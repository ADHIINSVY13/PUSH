  "lyrics": "A cover of the 1978 song by Gerry Rafferty that exchanges the original saxophone instrumentation for loud guitars\n[Verse 1]\nWinding your way down on Baker Street\nLight in your head and dead on your feet\nAnother crazy day\nYou drink the night away\nAnd forget about everything\nThis city's dance makes you feel so cold\nIt's got so many people but it's got no soul\nAnd it's taken you so long\nTo find out you were wrong\nWhen you thought it held everything\n[Bridge]\nUsed to think that it was so easy\nUsed to say that it was so easy\nBut you're trying, you're trying now\nAnother year and then you'll be happy\nJust one more year and then you'll be happy\nBut you're crying, you're crying now\n[Verse 2]\nWay down the street there's a light in his place\nOpens the door, he's got that look on his face\nAnd he asks you where you've been\nYou tell him who you've seen\nAnd you talk about everything\n\nHe's got this dream about buying some land\nHe's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands\nAnd then he'll settle down\nIn this quiet little town\nAnd forget about everything\n[Bridge]\nBut you know he'll always keep moving\nYou know, he's never gonna stop moving\n'Cause he's rolling, he's a rolling stone\nWhen you wake up, it's a new morning\nThe sun is shining, it's a new morning\nYou're going, you're going home"
