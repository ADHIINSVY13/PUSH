  "lyrics": "Ed has explained the meaning behind this track a couple times when performing it live. A good example being his live show in Excelsior, Minnesota.\n[Verse 1]\n\"If we take this bird in with its broken leg\nWe could nurse it,\" she said\nCome inside for a little lie down with me\nAnd if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing\nBut when I wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder\nAnd tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?\nLet me hold ya, oh\n[Chorus]\nBut if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?\nDarling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do\nAnd it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet\n'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon\nAnd I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird\nMy little bird\n[Verse 2]\nIf we take a walk out in the morning dew\nWe can lay down, so I'm next to you\nCome inside for a little homemade tea\nAnd if you fall asleep, then, at least, you're next to me\nAnd if I wake up, you say, \"It's late, love, get back to sleep\"\nI'm covered by nature and I'm safe now\nUnderneath this oak tree with you beside me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?\nDarling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do\nAnd it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet\n'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon\nAnd I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird\nMy little bird, my little bird, my little bird\n[Bridge]\nAnd of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love\nYou make me scream and then, I made you cry\nWhen I left that little bird with its broken leg to die\n[Chorus]\nBut if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?\nDarling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do\nAnd it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet\n'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon\nBut I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird\nMy little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa\nMy little bird, my little bird, my little bird\nYou're my little bird"
