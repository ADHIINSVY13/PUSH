Does she give great head?\nDo you think about her? No, I'm fine, it doesn't matter\nTell me, is she easy-going? Never controlling?\nWell-traveled? Well-read? Oh God, she makes me so obsessed\n\n[Outro]\nI'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)\nShe's been asleep on my side in your bed (Ah), woah\nI'm so obsessed with your ex (God, she makes me so upset)\nI'm so obsessed with your, with your ex"
