(Who will show me how?)\n[Bridge]\nI'll take care of everything\nI'll take care of everything\nI'll take care of everything\nFrom now on\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now?\nWho will show me how?\nWhere are you now?\nWho will show me how? (Who will show me how?)\nWhere are you now?\nWho will show me how?\nWhere are you now?\nWho will show me, who will show me how?\n\n[Outro]\nI'll take care of everything\nI'll take care of everything\nI'll take care of everything\nI'll take care of everything"
