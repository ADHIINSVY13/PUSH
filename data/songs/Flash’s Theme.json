Open fire! All weapons! Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body\n\n[Chorus: Freddie Mercury, Brian May & Roger Taylor]\nFlash, ah\nGordon's alive\nFlash, ah\nHe'll save every one of us\n[Bridge: Freddie Mercury, \nFreddie Mercury & Brian May\n]\nJust a man with a man's courage\nYou know he's nothin' but a man\nAnd he can never fail\nNo one but the pure at heart\nMay find the\n Golden Grail\nOh, oh\n[Skit: Dale]\nFlash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth\n[Outro: Freddie Mercury, Brian May & Roger Taylor]\nFlash"
