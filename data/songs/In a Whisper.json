  "lyrics": "Alone at half past midnight\nShe calls his name\nAfraid that in the morning\nThat nothing will change\nAnd where, where are the things that we fought for?\nAnd where, where is the love?\nAnd where, where are the answers\nYou told us would come from up above?\nThis is how the world ends, this is how the world ends\nThis is how the world ends in a whisper\nShe says she'd like to tell you just where they met\nShe says she's tryin' but she can't remember yet\nSometimes when she's at home and she's all alone\nShe thinks she hears him call her on the telephone\nAnd she says\n\"Where, where is the love that you promised?\nAnd where, where have you gone?\nI've search for you but when I get near\nYou leave me on my own\"\nThis is how the world ends, this is how the world ends\nThis is how the world ends in a whisper\nThis is how the world ends, this is how the world ends\nThis is how the world ends in a whisper\nSome days she tries to find him but where should she look?\nShould she look in the city or in a book?\nAnd where, where are the things that we fought for?\nAnd where, where is the love?\nAnd where, where are the answers\nYou told us would come from up above?\nThis is how the world ends, this is how the world ends\nThis is how the world ends in a whisper"
