  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere was a hentai video that I saw\nI told you about the night that we first made love\nAbout a girl who as soon as she made you cum\nCould show you the future and tell you your fortune\n[Chorus]\nBeautiful hearts are in your eyes\nI've been waiting for you to fall for me\nAnd let me in your life\nI've been waiting for you\n[Verse 2]\nTold you I wanted to die in an airplane crash\nOver the ocean, \nthat it was romantic\nBut you didn't like it, thought it was stupid, and\nThinking of me dead was making you feel bad\n[Chorus]\nBeautiful hearts are in your eyes\nI've been waiting for you to fall for me\nAnd let me in your life\nI've been waiting for you\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nBeautiful hearts are in your eyes\nI've been waiting for you to fall for me\nAnd let me in your life\nI've been waiting for you"
