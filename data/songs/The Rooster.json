Not hardly; I'm tryin' to stay up outta that womb\nOr that p-u-s-s, puss, I said puss\nLuther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed\nSmashed, pushed to the limit, smash and turned it timid\nIf anyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked\nThe cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold\nBoth of our tempers were on swole\nFor the most, most part, you fuss, fight, fart\nYou build it up to break it down and now take it from the start\nRepeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash\nOf two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the signs\n[Chorus]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n[Verse 3]\nK-O, knocked out by technicality\nThe love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me\nMy daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings\nAnd then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing\nI think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact\nBecause he saw me and you argue, now the energy's coming back\nSet an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track\nBut I'm married to the music and committed to the wax\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CDs, baby, please\nYou make me wanna scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? (Wax)\nTapes, CDs, baby, please\nYou make me wanna scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\nThrow your fuckin'â€”\n[Chorus]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CDs\n, baby, please\nYou make me wanna scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? (Wax)\nTapes, CDs, baby, please\nYou make me wanna scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\n\n[Chorus]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out"
