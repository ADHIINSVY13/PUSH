  "lyrics": "Went out on a limb, gone too far\nI broke down at the side of the road\nStranded at the outskirts and the sun's creepin' up\nBaby's in the backseat, still fast asleep\nDreaming of better days\nI don't wanna call you, but you're all I have to turn to\nWhat do you say when it's all gone away?\nBaby, I didn't mean to hurt you\nTruth spoke in whispers will tear you apart\nNo matter how hard you resist it\nIt never rains when you want it to\nYou humble me, Lord\nYou humble me, Lord\nI'm on my knees empty\nYou humble me, Lord\nYou humble me, Lord\nSo please, please, please forgive me\nBaby Theresa, she's got your eyes\nI see you all the time\nWhen she asks about her daddy\nI never know what to say\nHeard you kicked the bottle\nAnd you helped build a church\nYou carry an honest wage\nIs it true you have somebody keeping you company?\n\nWhat do you say when it's all gone away?\nBaby, I didn't mean to hurt you\nTruth spoke in whispers will tear you apart\nNo matter how hard you resist it\nIt never rains when you want it to\nYou humble me, Lord\nYou humble me, Lord\nI'm on my knees empty\nYou humble me, Lord\nYou humble me, Lord\nSo please, please forgive me\nYou humble me"
