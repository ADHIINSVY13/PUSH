(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)\nBut ain't nobody need you like I do (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)\nI know that there's others that deserve you (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)\nBut, my darlin', I am still in love with you\n[Chorus]\nBut I guess you look happier, you do\nMy friends told me one day I'll feel it, too\nI could try to smile to hide the truth\nBut I know I was happier with you\n[Outro]\n'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do\nI knew one day you'd fall for someone new\nBut if he breaks your heart like lovers do\nJust know that I'll be waitin' here for you"
