  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe came from Providence\nOne in Rhode Island\nWhere the old world shadows hang\nHeavy in the air\nShe packed her hopes and dreams\nLike a refugee\nJust as her father came\nAcross the sea\n[Verse 2]\nShe heard about a place\nPeople were smiling\nThey spoke about the red man's ways\nAnd how they loved the land\nAnd they came from everywhere\nTo the Great Divide\nSeeking a place to stand\nOr a place to hide\n[Verse 3]\nDown in the crowded bars\nOut for a good time\nCan't wait to tell you all\nWhat it's like up there\nAnd they called it paradise\nI don't know why\nSomebody laid the mountains low\nWhile the town got high\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd then the chilly winds blew down\nAcross the desert\nThrough the canyons of the coast\nTo the Malibu\nWhere the pretty people play\nHungry for power\nTo light their neon way\nAnd give them things to do\n[Verse 5]\nSome rich men came and raped the land\nNobody caught 'em\nPut up a bunch of ugly boxes\nAnd, Jesus, people bought 'em\nAnd they called it paradise\nThe place to be\nThey watched the hazy sun\nSinking in the sea\n[Verse 6]\nYou can leave it all behind\nAnd sail to Lahaina\nJust like the missionaries did\nSo many years ago\nThey even brought a neon sign\n\"Jesus is coming\"\nThey brought the white man's burden down\nBrought the white man's reign\n\n[Verse 7]\nWho will provide the grand design?\nWhat is yours and what is mine?\n'Cause there is no more new frontier\nBut we have got to make it here\nWe satisfy our endless needs\nAnd justify our bloody deeds\nIn the name of destiny\nAnd in the name of God\n[Verse 8]\nAnd you can see them there\nOn Sunday morning\nAnd stand up and sing about\nWhat it's like up there\nThey call it paradise\nI don't know why\nYou call someplace paradise\nKiss it goodbye"
