  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBack and forth, that voice of yours keeps me up at night\nHelp me search to find the words that eat you up inside\nI go side to side like the wildest tides in your hurricane\nAnd I only hide what is on my mind because I can't explain\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I do, Lord? What if I don't?\nI'd have to lose everything just to find you\nWhat if I do, Lord? What if I don't?\nI'd have to lose everything just to find you\n[Verse 2]\nIt's my turn, this soul won't burn, so throw me in the fire\nTrophies earned and lessons learned from wicked little liars\nWe could pave new roads with their cold gravestones and wind them through the pines\nShould I stay or should I go\n alone? I cannot decide\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I do, Lord? What if I don't?\nI'd have to lose everything just to find you\nWhat if I do, Lord? What if I don't?\nI'd have to lose everything just to find you\n[Bridge]\nCarolina, Caroline\nCarolina, Caroline\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I do, Lord? What if I don't?\nI'd have to lose everything just to find you\nWhat if I do, Lord? What if I don't?\nI'd have to lose everything just to find you\n[Outro]\nCarolina, Caroline\nCarolina, Caroline\nCarolina, Caroline\nCarolina, Caroline"
