  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm a fool to want you\nI'm a fool to want you\nTo want a love that can't be true\nA love that's there for others too\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a fool to hold you\nSuch a fool to hold you\nTo seek a kiss not mine alone\nTo share a kiss the Devil has known\n[Chorus]\nTime and time again I said I'd leave you\nTime and time again I went away\nBut then would come the time when I would need you\nAnd once again these words I'll have to say\n[Verse 3]\nTake me back, I love you\nPity me, I need you\nI know it's wrong, it must be wrong\nBut right or wrong I can't get along\nWithout you"
