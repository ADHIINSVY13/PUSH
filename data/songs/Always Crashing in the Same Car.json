  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEvery chance, every chance that I take\nI take it on the road\nThose kilometers and the red lights\nI was always looking left and right\n[Chorus]\nOh, but I'm always crashing in the same car\n[Verse 2]\nJasmine, I saw you peeping\nAs I pushed my foot down to the floor\nI was going round and round the hotel garage\nMust have been touching close to 94\n[Chorus]\nOh, but I'm always crashing in the same car\nYeah, yeah"
