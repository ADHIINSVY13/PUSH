(Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nTell me what you gon' do to me\nConfrontation ain't nothin' new to me\nYou can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue\nBut you can't bring the truth to me\nFuck you and all your expectations\nI don't even want your congratulations\nI recognize your false confidence\nAnd calculated promises all in your conversation\nI hate people that feel entitled\nLook at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you\nOh, you important?\nYou the moral to the story? You endorsin'?\nMotherfucker, I don't even like you\nCorrupt a man's heart with a gift\nThat's how you find out who you dealin' with\nA small percentage who I'm buildin' with\nI want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'\nOn my mama, that's the realest shit\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\n[Verse 2: SZA]\nSkin covered in ego\nGet to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound\nGot no end game, got no ways out, got to stay down\nIt's the way that you making me feel\nLike nobody ever loved me like you do, you do\nYou kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me\nIf you do, I won't move\nI ain't just cry for no reason (Reason), I ain't just pray for no reason (Reason)\nI give thanks for the days, for the hours\nAnd another way, another life breathin'\nI did it all 'cause it feel good\nI wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad\nBetter live your life\nWe're runnin' out of time\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for? (Ooh)\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n[Chorus: SZA]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer"
