  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nO Holy night, the stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night of our dear Savior's birth\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\n'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth\nA thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn\nFall on your knees, O hear the Angel voices\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born\nO night divine, O night, O night divine, ooh"
