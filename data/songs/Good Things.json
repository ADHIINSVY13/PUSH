It’s all over me\nI can feel it coming over me\nCan you feel it? It’s all over me\n\n[Chorus]\nGood things, good things\nHappen past midnight, midnight (Oh)\nGood things, good things\nHappen before sunrise, sunrise\nBaby, turn the lights down\nLights down, lights down\nDo it for me right now\nRight now, right now\nBaby, turn the lights down\nLights down, lights down\nDo it for me right now\nRight now, right now (Oh)\n[Verse 2]\nDirty like the dance-floor\nPsychedelic candy store\nIn a transe, dizzy stance\nI got what you’re looking for\nNaughty indication, give into temptation\nLate at night, what a high\nWhen we conversate\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI can feel it coming over me\nCan you feel it? It’s all over me\nI can feel it coming over me\nCan you feel it? It’s all over me\n\n[Chorus]\nGood things, good things\nHappen past midnight, midnight (Oh)\nGood things, good things\nHappen before sunrise, sunrise\nBaby, turn the lights down\nLights down, lights down\nDo it for me right now\nRight now, right now\nBaby, turn the lights down\nLights down, lights down\nDo it for me right now\nRight now, right now (Oh)\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nGood things, good things\nHappen past midnight, midnight (Oh)\nGood things, good things\nHappen before sunrise, sunrise\nBaby, turn the lights down\nLights down, lights down\nDo it for me right now\nRight now, right now\nBaby, turn the lights down\nLights down, lights down\nDo it for me right now\nRight now, right now (Oh)"
