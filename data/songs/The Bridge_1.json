  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've seen the bridge and the bridge is long\nAnd they built it high and they built it strong\nStrong enough to hold the weight of time\nLong enough to leave some of us behind\n[Chorus]\nAnd every one of us has to face that day\nDo you cross the bridge or do you fade away\nAnd every one of us that ever came to play\nHas to cross the bridge or fade away\n[Verse 2]\nStanding on the bridge looking at the waves\nSeen so many jump, never seen one saved\nOn a distant beach your song can die\nOn a bitter wind, on a cruel tide\n[Chorus]\nAnd every one of us has to face that day\nDo you cross the bridge or do you fade away\nAnd every one of us that ever came to play\nHas to cross the bridge or fade away\n[Bridge]\nAnd the bridge it shines\nOh cold hard iron\nSaying come and risk it all\nOr die trying\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd every one of us has to face that day\nDo you cross the bridge or do you fade away\nAnd every one of us that ever came to play\nHas to cross the bridge or fade away"
