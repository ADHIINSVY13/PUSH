Go, go, go!\n[Chorus]\nYou know you make me break out\nMake me break out\nI don't wanna look like that\nI don't wanna look like that\nYou know you make me break out\nMake me break out\nI don't wanna look like that\nI don't wanna look like that\nI don't wanna look like that\nI don't wanna look like that\n\n[Outro]\nYou know you make me break out\nMake me break out\nMake me break out, yeah!"
