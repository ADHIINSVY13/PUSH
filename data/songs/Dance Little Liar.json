  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI heard the truth was built to bend\nA mechanism to suspend\nThe guilt is what you will require\nAnd still \nyou've got to dance little liar\nJust like those fibs to pop and fizz\nAnd you'll be forced to take that awful quiz\nAnd you're bound to trip and she'll detect the fiction\nOn your lips and dig a contradiction up\n[Chorus]\nAnd the clean coming will hurt\nAnd you can never get it spotless\nWhen there's dirt beneath the dirt\nThe liar takes a lot less time\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sure it's clear and plain to read\nIt's not an alibi you need just yet\nOh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat\nYes, that will get you back to normal\nAnd after you have dabbed the patch\nYou'll breathe and then proceed to scratch\nThe varnish off that newly added calmness\nSo as not to raise any alarms too soon\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the clean coming will hurt\nAnd you can never get it spotless\nWhen there's dirt beneath the dirt\n[Bridge]\nThe liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter\nHave you got itchy bones? And in all your time alone\nCan you hack your mind being riddled\nWith the wrong memories?\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nAnd the clean coming will hurt\nAnd you can never get it spotless\nWhen there's dirt between the dirt"
