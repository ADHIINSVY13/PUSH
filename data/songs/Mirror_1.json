(\nWoah\n)\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nLooking at me now, I can see my past\nDamn, I look just like my fucking dad\nLight it up, that's smoke and mirrors\nI even look good in a broken mirror\nI see my mama smile, that's a blessing\nI see the change, I see the message\nAnd no message could've been any clearer\nSo I'm starting with the man in the\n\n[Chorus: Bruno Mars & \nLil Wayne\n]\nMirror on the wall (\nMJ taught me that\n)\nHere we are again\nThrough my rise and fall (\nUh\n)\nYou've been my only friend (\nTake 'em to Mars, man\n)\nYou told me that they can\nUnderstand the man I am\nSo why are we\nTalking to each other again? (\nUh\n)\nMirror on the wall (Woah)\nHere we are again (\nYeah\n)\nThrough my rise and fall\nYou've been my only friend (\nAny questions?\n)\nYou told me that they can (\nI come to you\n)\nUnderstand the man I am (\nYou always have the answer\n)\nSo why are we here\nTalking to each other again?\n[Outro: Bruno Mars & \nLil Wayne\n]\nMirror on the wall\nHey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time\nSo why are we\nTalking to each other again?"
