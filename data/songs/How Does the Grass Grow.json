  "artist": "David Bowie",
  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's a graveyard by the station where the girls\nWear vinyl skirts and sandals from Hungary\nThe boys ride their Riga 1s upon the little hills\nSuch sadness and grief, the kids die standing\nThat's where we made our tryst and struggled with our guns\nWould you still love me if the clocks could go backwards?\nThe girls would fill with blood, and the grass will be green again\nRemember the dead, they were so great, some of them\n[Chorus]\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nHow does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nWhere do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud\nHow does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood\n[Verse 2]\nWell I lived a blind life, a white face, a prison\nThat you made, a life out of nothing, now I ride by\nBlack roads. I miss you more than you'll never, ever know\nWaiting with my red eyes and my stone heart\n[Chorus]\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nHow does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nWhere do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud\nHow does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood\n\n[Bridge]\nI gaze in defeat at the stars in the night\nThe light in my life burnt away\nThere will be no tomorrow\nThen you'll sigh in your sleep\nAnd meaning returns with the day\n[Chorus]\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nYa, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya\nWhere do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud\nHow does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood"
