  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStreet cars always get in the way\nDaylight interrupts our starry gaze\nShe goes seems we ran out of time\nBut the memory left a picture on the canvas of my mind\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll wrap myself in the thought of her smell\nWish of our lips\nLocked in a kiss\nShe floats in to my bedroom every night\nClose my eyes\nShe's alive\nHere comes the morning but I'm all alone\nDreams of a love I'll call my own\nDreams of a love I've never known\n[Verse 2]\nNew day, same hot sun on the street\nAnd I say I wonder if we'll ever meet\nThere she goes\nTaxi steals her way\nI keep tellin myself I'll find her love\nI come back everyday\n[Chorus]\nI still wrap myself in the thought of her smell\nWish of our lips\nLocked in a kiss\nShe floats in to my bedroom every night\nI close my eyes\nShe's alive\nHere comes the morning but I'm all alone\nDreams of a love I'll call my own\nDreams of a love I've never known\n\n[Verse 3]\nDreams of her love\nWill they ever come true?\nAm I a fool to dream of you?\nYou float in to my bedroom every night\nI close my eyes and your alive\nHere comes the morning and I'm still alone\nDreams of her love I'll call my own\nDreams of her love I've never known\nDreams of her love I'll call my own\nDreams of her love I've never known"
