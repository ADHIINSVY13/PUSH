So sick, I make you mentally vomit\nThese rappers askin' for beats and ain't even fit to be on it\nI see 'em write about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach\nBecause they talk 'bout the future, but didn't mention me on it\nSo now I'm back in the kitchen cookin', I'm meant to be one of the greatest\nNo nigga seein' me this century, uh, and you hate it\nLook how I played it, other niggas was jaded\nUnderappreciated, now Carolina is rated\nLet Elite breathe, yeah\nYeah, hey, uh, uh, uh, uh\nI let Elite breathe, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAyy, you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me\nI know it won't be long 'fore you heard about me\nMy head's to the sky and I'm on my grind\nI'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine\nTake what's mine, hey, hey"
