WHAT?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen they crown you and you rise up to your position\nCarry on tradition\nWhen they knight you, then you go to fight\nGo to war, don't petition, carry on tradition\nCarry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition\nCarry on tradition\nWhen you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition\n[Verse 3]\nNow niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer\nEngineers got his earplugs and still hear us\nThe live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state-of-art sound\nWe on the charts now\nFrom British Walkers and Argyles –\nLook at us rap stars now, with our black cars now\n'Fortune'\n 500 listed, \nbrunches, Cipriani's\nSippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me\nThick white girls around me, Chinese lined up\nBecause I'm what? Every dime lust\nWe used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up\nIf I want that, or the whole world to peep it\nNow, carry on tradition\nFuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'\nPeace to the strugglin' artists and dead ones gone, we miss 'em\nI promise, I carry on tradition (Uhh)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen they crown you and you rise up to your position\nCarry on tradition\nWhen they knight you, then you go to fight\nGo to war, don't petition, carry on tradition\nCarry on tradition, carry on, ca-carry on, carry on tradition\nCarry on tradition\nWhen you rep what we rep, then carry on tradition"
