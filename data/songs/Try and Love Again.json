  "lyrics": "When you're out there on your own\nWhere your memories can find you\nLike a circle goes around\nYou were lost until you found out\nWhat it all comes down to\nOne by one the lonely feelings come\nDay by day they slowly fade away\nOoh, the look was in her eyes\nYou never know what might be found there\nShe was dancing right in time\nAnd the moves she made so fine\nLike the music that surrounds her\nShould I stay or go? I really want to know\nWould I lose or win if I try and love again?\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna try and love again\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love\nRight or wrong, what's done is done\nIt's only moments that you borrow\nBut the thoughts will linger on\nOf the lady and her song\nWhen the sun comes up tomorrow\nWell, it might take years\nTo see through all these tears\nDon't let go\nWhen you find it, you will know\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nSometimes lose, sometimes win\nSometimes you need a friend\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nGonna try\nGonna try\nGonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try\nGonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try\nGonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try\nGonna try, ooh-ooh\nGonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try\nGonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try\nGonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try\nGonna try, ooh-ooh-ooh"
