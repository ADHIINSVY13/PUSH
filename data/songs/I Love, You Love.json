Broken promises linger in our mind\nI'll give in completely. Hearts break so easy\nI know. Believe me. Oh, I've tried\nBut my arms can hold you. My kiss console you\nI'll come and love you tonight\n[Chorus]\nAnd I...\nI love, I love, I love\nLove hurts sometimes\nBut this feels right\nYou...\nYou love, you love, you love\nThough you've been burned\nYou still return\n[Verse 2]\nCome and share my house, my home, and all I own\nI'd love to give to you\nAren't you tired of going along this lonely road?\nIt takes its toll on you\n\nGive me your emotion, your heart's devotion\nGive anything you like\nAnd I'll give understanding. Life's so demanding\nI'm all you need to get by\n[Chorus]\nAnd I...\nI love, I love, I love\nLove hurts sometimes\nBut this feels right\nAnd You...\nYou love, you love, you love\nThough you've been burned\nYou still return\nI love, I love, I love\nLove hurts sometimes\nBut this feels right\nAnd You...\nYou love you love you love\nThough you've been burned\nYou still return\nStill return\nStill return to love (Oh)\nKeep coming back to love (Ah oh)"
