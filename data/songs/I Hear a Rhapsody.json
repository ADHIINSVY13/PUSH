  "lyrics": "(When you're near, the murmuring of the breeze)\n(Becomes a symphony)\n(A rhapsody)\nAnd when I hear you call\nSo softly to me\nI don't hear a call at all\nI hear a rhapsody\nAnd when your sparkling eyes\nAre smiling at me\nThen soft through the starlit skies\nI hear a rhapsody\nMy days are so blue when you're away\nMy heart longs for you, so won't you stay?\nMy darling, hold me tight\nAnd whisper to me\nThen soft through the starry night\nI'll hear a rhapsody\n(My days are so blue when you're away)\nMy heart longs for you, so won't you stay?\n(Forever and ever, won't you stay?)\n\nMy darling, hold me tight\nAnd whisper to me\nThen soft through a starry night\nI'll hear a rhapsody"
