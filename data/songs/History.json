I need you desperately\nNot just for the moment, to make history\n[Chorus: Tony Williams]\nNow that all the smoke is gone (lighter)\nAnd the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)\nVictory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)\nHistory so loved, so long, so long, so long\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nSo now I’m flirting with death\nHustling like a G, while victory wasn’t watching\nTook chances repeatedly\nAs a teenage boy, before acne\nBefore I got proactive, I couldn’t face she\nI just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets\nI swear I met success, we lived together shortly\nA success is like lust, she's good for the touch\nShe's good for the moment, but she’s never enough\nEverybody’s had her, she’s nothing like V\nA success is all I got, unfortunately\nBut I’m burning down the block, \nhopin' in and out of V's\nBut something tells me that there’s much more to see\nBefore I get killed, cause I can’t get robbed\nSo before me, success and death ménage\nI gotta get lost, I gotta find V\nWe gotta be together to make history\n[Chorus: Tony Williams]\nNow that all the smoke is gone (lighter)\nAnd the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)\nVictory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)\nHistory so loved, so long, so long, so long\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nNow victory is mine, she tastes so sweet\nShe’s my trophy wife, she's coming with me\nWe'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly\nWe'll name him history, he'll repeat after me\nHe’s my legacy, son of my hard work\nFuture of my past, he’ll explain who I be\nRank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3\nIf I ain’t number one\n then I failed you victory\nAin’t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks\nAin’t in it for the money, can’t take it when you leave\nI wanna be remembered long after you grieve\nLong after I’m gone, long after I breathe\nI leave all I am, in the hands of history\nThat's my last will testimony\nThis is much more than a song, it’s a baby shower\nI’ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours\n\n[Chorus: Tony Williams]\nNow that all the smoke is gone\nAnd the battle's finally won\nVictory’s finally ours\nHistory so loved, so long, so long, so long\nNow that all the smoke is gone\nAnd the battle's finally won\nVictory’s finally ours\nHistory so loved, so long, so long, so long"
