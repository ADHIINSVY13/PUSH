  "lyrics": "The seemingly non-sensical title of the track is pronounced “The Frame Tour”.\n[Verse 1]\n007 and Brucey Wayne\nAre shitting \nthem sens\n because there's another name\nComing to claim what is his to claim\nTen percent faster with a sturdier frame\nHe's certainly come into his own\nThere's one on his arm in every land that he roams\nAnd two consecutive nights alone\nAre a thing of the past\n as he has recently shown\n[Chorus]\nThey said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing\nDrawing you in like it's boring to him\nIt's a war you can't win and the first and the last\nAre two things you'll never be, my darling\n[Verse 2]\nAnother roll around and another push and shove\nFurther away from the idea of love\nAnd his conclusion, it must be good\nOr when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud\nForgot to kick the tin\nHe knows where she's going but don't know where she's been\nAnd as opposed to the other thing\nHe'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in\n\n[Chorus]\nThey said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing\nDrawing you in like it's boring to him\nIt's a war you can't win and the first and the last\nAre two things you'll never be, my darling\n(Two things you'll never be, my darling)\nTwo things you will never be, my darling\n(Two things you'll never be, my darling)\n[Outro]\nWell, he sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up-lines\nNot to feel like a twat at times\nIt's hard, but not for this kid\nNot when they come to you"
