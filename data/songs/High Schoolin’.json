You won't last\nSee, you all in the race, just taking up space\nIf it's war on the other side of the tracks, grab the straps\nThought y'all knew, wild dogs run in packs\nSo, who you think you foolin'? We can get to duelin'\nOn some old school shit, like we high schoolin' (High schoolin'...)\n\n[Interlude: André 3000]\n{*schoolbell rings*}\nThere he is! Get him!\n(Don't run! Don't run!)\nYeah, sucker! What'cha gon' do now?

That's to assassinate\nGo masturbate, you jack-off\nNigga, take the hat off\nI'm a third year freshman, I started with the best of them\nBut now them niggas done passed me\nI'm just a baby daddy\nO.G. – Original Goofball\nThat used to slang the hard hard and smoke the soft soft\nAll-star through the way-hall\nNiggas up in the school, they know my name, look!\nBut that's because my face is in like eight different yearbooks\nCould've been took the S.A.T., but the streets got the best of me\nThankin', and drankin', and bankin', open wide like sesame\nY'all tellin' me to chill out (Chill out!)\nBefore you be a drop out (Chill out!)\nA cop-out, is when you're thirty-something at your mom's house, yeah\n\n[Chorus: OutKast]\nDon't stop and, uh, don't quit, 'cause, uh...\nWe on that high school shit, and, uh\nYou know that, uh, we steady\nJitterbug jam, now can you dig it?\nJust, uh, don't stop and, uh, don't quit, 'cause uh...\nWe on that high school shit, and, uh\nYou know that, uh, we steady\nJitterbug jam, now can you dig it?\nDon't stop and, uh, don't quit, 'cause, uh...\nWe on that high school shit, and, uh\nYou know that, uh, we steady\nJitterbug jam, now can you dig it?\nJust, uh, don't stop and, uh, don't quit, 'cause uh...\nWe on that high school shit, and, uh\nYou know that, uh, we steady\nJitterbug jam, now can you dig it?\nDon't stop and, uh, don't quit, 'cause, uh...\nWe on that high school shit, and, uh\nYou know that, uh, we steady\nJitterbug jam, now can you dig it?\nJust, uh, don't stop and, uh, don't quit, 'cause uh..."
