I just wanna know\nHow come you act so different? Talk to me, I'll listen\nAll the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was out there on the road, life out of control\nShe became a victim to my busy schedule\nAnd I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care\nThis one's dedicated to the girl out there\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you always catch me at the bad time (Bad time)\nWhen I know you probably think it's a lie (A lie)\nI know I told you last time was the last time (Last time)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Flatline)\nFlatline (Flatline), flatline (Flatline)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Oh-oh)\n'Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply (Reply)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline?\n[Verse 2]\nHard breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?\nShe said she's leaving, damn, I can't believe it\nIt's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me\nShut my heart down, and I don't know what I'ma do now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was out there on the road, life out of control\nShe became a victim to my busy schedule\nAnd I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care\nThis one's dedicated to the girl out there\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you always catch me at the bad time (Bad time)\nWhen I know you probably think it's a lie (A lie)\nI know I told you last time was the last time (Last time)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Flatline)\nFlatline (Flatline), flatline (Flatline)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Oh-oh)\n'Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply (Reply)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline?\n[Bridge]\nGirl, you always catch me at the bad time\nGirl, you always catch me at the bad time\nI know I told you last time was the last time\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Flatline)\nFlatline (Flatline)\n[Chorus]\nGirl, you always catch me at the bad time (Bad time)\nWhen I know you probably think it's a lie (A lie)\nI know I told you last time was the last time (Last time)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Flatline)\nFlatline (Flatline), flatline (Flatline)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline? (Oh-oh)\n'Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply (Reply)\nHow could you pull the plug and leave me flatline?"
