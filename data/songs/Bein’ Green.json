  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's not that easy bein' green\nHaving to spend each day the color of the leaves\nWhen I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold\nOr something much more colourful like that\n[Verse 2]\nIt's not easy bein' green\nIt seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things\nAnd people tend to pass you over 'cause you're\nNot standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water\nOr stars in the sky\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut green is the colour of spring\nAnd green can be cool and friendly-like\n[Chorus]\nAnd green can be big like an ocean\nOr important like a mountain\nOr tall like a tree\nWhen green is all there is to be\nIt could make you wonder why\nBut why wonder, why wonder?\nI am green and it'll do fine\nIt's beautiful\nAnd I think it's what I want to be\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd green can be big like an ocean\nOr important like a mountain\nOr tall like a tree\nWhen green is all there is to be\nIt could make you wonder why\nBut why wonder, why wonder?\nI am green and it'll do fine\nIt's beautiful\nAnd I think it's what I want to be"
