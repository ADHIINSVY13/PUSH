And I ain’t never had to watch nigga\nRich or wealthy, pick your poison\nI think I paid for one too many abortions \nAnother Celine, it’s like a routine\nIt’s like a ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans\nHer new body's in my new body\nMake her in an hourglass that’s my new hobby\nRich nigga shit, how I blew my first million\nLuckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin\n[Chorus]\nTalk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though\nWhen you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole\nThe realest nigga to marathon on the RICO\nThe last cocaine superhero\nI got the cape on, to cover kilos\nThe villain wins, the evolution of Nino\nGoddamn Batman holy toledo\nNah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nThe Robb Report of the snort\nKings hold court\nLawyers get bought\nPalms get greased when them cases get fought\nNo felony what the fuck is you tellin’ me\nReduced to simple assault\nIt cost to keep it hush-hush\nIt was just us\nEnded up sellin’ my Bat Mobile\nThe crash don’t kill\nIt’s how you survives it\nRebound on niggas, I nine live’d it\nCouldn’t miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun\nBitches ain’t respecting niggas not in full bloom\nSo the neck is full moon\nI’m living a lie, she live for this life\nAnd loving the Alaia pumps\nLoving the rush, I’m living “The Wire” Uh\nDrugs and this rap is really “Empire”\nRich nigga shit, how I lost my second million\nLuckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya\n[Chorus]\nTalk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though\nWhen you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole\nThe realest nigga to marathon on the RICO\nThe last cocaine superhero\nI got the cape on, to cover kilos\nThe villain wins, the evolution of Nino\nGoddamn Batman holy toledo\nNah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though\n\n[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]\nTen toes deep in the trap, nigga I’m good here\nFeelin’ like Tony reading words on the Goodyear\nBig said, “Only the FEDs I should fear”\nSo no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there\nYeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene\nKerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring\nNothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona\nIt’s homicide when I slide up on ya\nReporting live from the project benches\nHella 'caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes \nHeron zombies street-walking on three-week binges\nClientele look like the “Thriller” vid in 3D lenses\nCOD, niggas never had to front me jawns\nI’m weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on\nI’m Nino Brown in the projects\nYes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex\nGet rich or die tryin’ is my mindset\nAnd spend it all until I’m swallowing dirt\n'Cause I ain’t never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse\n \nI ain’t never see a dead man taking the stand\nI ain’t never see a nigga swallow a bullet \nAnd live to talk about it\n'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it\nYou watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it\nNigga shit, that’s how I lost three million\nLuckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya"
