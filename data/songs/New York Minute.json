Please come back\"\nWhat the head makes cloudy\nThe heart makes very clear\nThe days were so much brighter\nIn the time when she was here\nBut I know there's somebody somewhere\nMake these dark clouds disappear\nUntil that day, I have to believe\nI believe, I believe\n\n[Chorus]\nIn a New York Minute\nEverything can change\nIn a New York Minute\nThings can get pretty strange\nIn a New York Minute\nEverything can change\nIn a New York Minute"
