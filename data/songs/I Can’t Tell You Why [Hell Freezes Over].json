Schmidt]\nEvery time I try to walk away\nSomething makes me turn around and stay\nAnd I can't tell you why\n[Verse 2: Timothy B. Schmidt]\nWhen we get crazy, it just ain't right (Try to keep your head, little girl)\nGirl, I get lonely, too\nYou don't have to worry, just hold on tight (Don't get caught in your little world)\n'Cause I love you\n[Chorus: Timothy B. Schmidt]\nNothing's wrong as far as I can see\nWe make it harder than it has to be\nAnd I can't tell you why\nNo, baby, I can't tell you why\nI can't tell you why\n[Bridge]\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)\n\n[Chorus: Timothy B. Schmidt]\nEvery time I try to walk away\nSomething makes me turn around and stay\nAnd I can't tell you why\nNo, no, baby, I can't tell you why\nI can't tell you why\nI can't tell you why\nNo\n[Spoken]\nThank you"
