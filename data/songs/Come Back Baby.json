Push has been rapping about cocaine since the beginning of his career, mainly because he used to actually sell it.\n[Intro: The Mighty Hannibal]\nI wanna talk to all you addicts out there\nThat's got yourself a great big Jones\nAn' you done tried all the methadone\nAn' you just can't leave that heroin alone\nI wonder, have you tried\n[Verse 1]\nDope just touched down, I'm so grateful\nNumbers so low, bitch, be thankful\nThey say don't let money change you\nThat's how we know money ain't you\nBitch, I been had, bitches been bad\nWe buy big boats, bitch, I'm Sinbad\nDownright sinful, bitch, we been full\nAll my dopeboys, we like kinfolk\nBMore burnt spoon, DC glass pipe\nVA sent bales, 'bout that trap life\nBlew through thousands, we made millions\nCocaine soldiers, once civilians\nBought hoes Hondas, took care children\nLent my pastor, build out buildin's\nRapped on classics, I been brilliant\nNow we blend in, we chameleons, ahh\n[Chorus: George Jackson]\nNever have I been locked up in a world of misery\nI need you darlin' to set me free\nCome back, baby, try me one more time\nOoh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind\nI can't—\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho else got the luxury to drop when he want\n'Cause nobody else can fuck with me? What a show-off\nNigga, wrist for wrist—let's have a glow-off\nFuck it, brick for brick—let's have a blow-off\nIf we go by connections made\nI can still climb ladders when complexions fade (Yugh)\nWhite on white, that's the testa\nBlack on black, that's the Tesla\nSee these diamonds in this watch face?\nAll that shit came from pressure\nThey don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind\nAnd they tired of dancin' like a Ying Yang Twin\nYou can't have the Yin without the Yang, my friend\nReal niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (Yugh)\nCan't escape the scale if I tried\nInterstate trafficking's alive\nPush\n[Chorus: George Jackson]\nNever have I been locked up in a world of misery\nI need you darlin' to set me free\nCome back, baby, try me one more time\nOoh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind\nI can't—\n\n[Verse 3]\nStill fresh off the boat, niggas\nDon't make me super-soak niggas\nYour life ends up a quote, nigga\nThe good die young, all dogs go to heaven\nIt's really just momma's fallin' out on the reverend\nI play musical chairs with these squares\nRich flair before they was Ric Flair's\nCocaine concierge, longest runnin' trapper of the year\nStood the test of time like Dapper Dan\nSeason my sauce like Zatarain's\nIs he still in the caravan? (No)\nIt's a mil' in the caravan? (Whoa)\nRichard Mille on a leather band (Ooh)\nBehind the wheel like an ambulance (Go)\nOn my way up to Maryland (Gone)\n[Chorus: George Jackson]\nNever have I been locked up in a world of misery\nI need you darlin' to set me free\nCome back, baby, try me one more time\nOoh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind\nI can't—\nCome back, baby, try me one more time\nOoh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind\nI—I can't—"
