  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy cards are on the table, yours are in your hand\nChances are, tonight, you've already got plans\nAnd chances are I will talk myself to sleep again\nYou give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high\nWishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right\nAnd I will block out these voices of reason in my head\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd the voices say, \"You are not the exception\nYou will never learn your lesson\"\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\n[Verse 2]\nYou know how to keep me waitin'\nI know how to act like I'm fine\nDon't know what to call this situation\nBut I know I can't call you mine\nAnd it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof\n'Cause when my head is on your shoulder\nIt starts thinkin' you'll come around\nAnd maybe, someday, when we're older\nThis is something we'll laugh about\nOver coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut then the voices say, \"You are not the exception\nYou will never learn your lesson\"\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out\n[Bridge]\nNow I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands\nSayin', \"How could I not see the signs?\"\nOh, you haven't written me or called\nBut goodbye screamin' in the silence\nAnd the voices in my head are tellin' me why\n'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings\nI'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring\nAnd you will say you had the best of intentions\nAnd maybe I will finally learn my lesson\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will take the long way, you will take the long way down\nFoolish one\nStop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love\nThat ain't never gonna come\nYou will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nLa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh\nLa-la-la-la-la\nAin't never gonna come\nOoh, you will learn the hard way now\nFoolish one\nSittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love\nThey ain't never gonna come\nAnd thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out\nFoolish one\nThe day is gonna come for your confessions of love\nWhen all is said and done, he just wasn't the one\nNo, he just wasn't the one"
