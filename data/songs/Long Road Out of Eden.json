  "lyrics": "[Instrumental Intro]\n[Verse 1]\nMoon shining down through the palms\nShadows moving on the sand\nSomebody whispering the twenty-third psalm\nDusty rifle in his trembling hands\nSomebody trying just to stay alive\nHe got promises to keep\nOver the ocean in America\nFar away and fast asleep\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSilent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky\nCold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passing by\nGalaxies unfolding, new worlds being born\nPilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's a long road out of Eden\n[Verse 2]\nMusic blasting from an SUV\nOn a bright and sunny day\nRolling down the interstate\nIn the good old USA\nHaving lunch at the petroleum club\nSmoking fine cigars and swapping lives\nHe said, \"Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket!\"\n\"Give me another piece of that pecan pie!\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nFreeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune\nWe're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon\nCaptains of the old order clinging to the reins\nAssuring us these aches inside are only growing pains\n[Chorus]\nBut it's a long road out of Eden\n[Verse 3]\nBack home I was so certain\nThe path was very clear\nBut now I have to wonder\nWhat are we doing here?\nI'm not counting on tomorrow\nAnd I can't tell wrong from right\nBut I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight\n[Solo]\n[Verse 4]\nWeaving down the American highway\nThrough the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk\nBloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda\nAnd now we're driving dazed and drunk\nBeen down the road to Damascus\nThe road to Mandalay\nMet the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way\nHe said, \"It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste\"\n\"But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nBehold the bitten apple, the power of the tools\nBut all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's a long road out of Eden\n[Instrumental Outro]"
