Holding down this block? It ain't nothing\nYou the man nigga, now stop fronting\nHahah, I like your style (\nNah, I like your style\n)\nLet's drive around awhile! \nCool, nigga\nHere's a thou', \nA G? I ride with you for free\nI want the long-term riches and bitches\nHave it all, now listen to me\nYou let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame\nTen thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same\n(\nOn the low?\n) Yeah, the only way to blow\nYou let your shit bubble quietly (\nAND THEN YOU BLOW!\n)\nKid, keep your cool\nThe only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand\nThen you play your cards, \nthen he through dealing I understand\nDon't blow your dough on hotties\nThe only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts\nAnd won't break 'em for nobody\nHah, I like your résumé, pick a day, you can start\nFrom now until death do us part, nigga\n (Right!)\n[Chorus: Jay-Z & \nMemphis Bleek\n]\nIt's time to come up (\nand hold my own weight, defend my crown\n)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (\nstand my ground\n)\nIt's time to come up (\nand stick up my chest, and make some loot\n)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (\nstand on my own two\n)\nIt's time to come up (\nand hold my own weight, defend my crown\n)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (\nstand my ground\n)\nIt's time to come up (\n and stick up my chest, and make some loot\n)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (\nstand on my own two\n)"
