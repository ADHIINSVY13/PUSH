  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nStars are never sleeping\nDead ones and the living\n[Verse 1]\nWe live closer to the earth\nNever to the heavens\nThe stars are never far away\nThe stars are out tonight\nThey watch us from behind their shades\nBrigitte\n \nJack\n and \nKate\n and \nBrad\nFrom behind their tinted window stretch\nGleaming like blackened sunshine\n[Chorus]\nStars are never sleeping\nDead ones and the living\n[Verse 2]\nWaiting for the first move\nSatyrs\n and their \nchild wives\nWaiting for the last move\nSoaking up our primitive world\n[Chorus]\nStars are never sleeping\nDead ones and the living\n\n[Bridge]\nTheir jealousy's spilling down\nThe stars must stick together\nWe will never be rid of these stars\nBut I hope they live forever\nAnd they know just what we do\nThat we toss and turn at night\nThey're waiting to make their moves\nFor the stars are out tonight\n[Verse 3]\nHere they are upon the stairs\nSexless and unaroused\nThey are the stars, they're dying for you\nBut I hope they live forever\n[Interlude]\n[Verse 4]\nThey burn you with their radiant smiles\nTrap you with their beautiful eyes\nThey're broke and shamed or drunk or scared\nBut I hope they live forever\n[Bridge]\nTheir jealousy's spilling down\nThe stars must stick together\nWe will never be rid of these stars\nBut I hope they live forever\nAnd they know just what we do\nThat we toss and turn at night\nThey're waiting to make their moves on us\nThe stars are out tonight\n\n[Outro]\nThe stars are out tonight\nThe stars are out tonight, yeah"
