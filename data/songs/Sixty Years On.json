  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWho'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age\nWhen the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave?\nAnd se√±orita play guitar, play it just for you\nMy rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through\n[Verse 2]\nYou've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun\nYou know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun\n[Refrain]\nAnd the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun\nI've no wish to be living sixty years on (Oh, oh)\n[Verse 3]\nYes, I'll sit with you and talk, let your eyes relive again\nI know my vintage prayers would be very much the same\nAnd Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you\nYour choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through\n[Refrain]\nAnd the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun\nI've no wish to be living sixty years on"
