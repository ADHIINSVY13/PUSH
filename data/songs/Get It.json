Hee-hee! Aaow!)\nNo one's gonna get it (Da-da-da) (Ooh!)\nNo one's gonna get it, oh, no (Da-da-da)\nBut someone's gotta get it (Da-da-da)\nAnd I know that I will be the one who will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)\nGonna get it, her love\nGonna get it, her kisses\nGonna get it, her heart\nGonna get it, get it\n\n[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]\nMiss lady girl, ha!\nHas buried her feelings deep inside\n'Cause she don't want, ah\nTo be taken for another ride\nShe's sick and tired, ha!\nOf being on that lonely merry-go-round\nShe just don't know\nThat the ultimate love\nOf her life is about to be found, hoo!\n[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Wonder]\nThey think that ready cash, flashy clothes\nWill fill her life with laughter\nBut I've got the very thing that she needs\nTrue love forever after\nThen no more will she say\n[Chorus]\nThat no one's gonna get it\nNo one's gonna get it, oh, no\nBut someone's gotta get it\nAnd I feel that I will be the one who will\nNo one's gonna get it\nNo one's gonna get It, oh, no\nBut someone's gotta get it\nI know that I will be the one who will\nI'm gonna get it (I'm gonna get it)\nI'm gonna get it (You ain't gon' get it)\n(I'm gonna get it)\n(You ain't gon' get it)\n(I'm gonna get it)\n(I'm gonna get it)\nGonna get it, gonna get it\nGonna get it, get it, aaow!\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nGonna get it, gonna get it\nGonna get it, gonna get it\nHoo! Hoo!\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nYou ain't gonna get it\nYou know, ah, hoo!\nAaow!\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gonna get it\nI'm gon', gon' get it"
