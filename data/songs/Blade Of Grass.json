  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLovers kiss in a garden made of thorns\nTraces of lonely words, illusions torn\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou said, \"How does a man like me love a woman like you?\"\nI said, \"Hold me until I die and I'll make you brand new\"\n[Chorus]\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAround my finger like a cast\n'Cause even though the church burned down\nI'll be your queen without a crown\nI've been so lonely in this field\nFighting a battle with no shield\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAnd we'll make it last\n[Verse 2]\nThis is the lawn of memories I mourn\nI fall into your eyes, shelter from storm\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou said, \"How does a man like me love a woman like you?\"\nI said, \"Hold me until I die and I'll make you brand new\"\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAround my finger like a cast\n'Cause even though the church burned down\nI'll be your queen without a crown\nI've been so lonely in this field\nFighting a battle with no shield\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAnd we'll make it last\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAnd we'll make it last\n[Bridge]\nI'll give you something\nYeah, it's no diamond ring\nThe air that I'm breathing\nForever's not enough\nA song we'll both sing\nYeah, it's not the same thing\nYeah, it's not the same thing\nForever's not enough\n[Chorus]\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAround my finger like a cast\n'Cause even though the church burned down\nI'll be your queen without a crown\nI've been so lonely in this field\nFighting a battle with no shield\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAnd we'll make it last\nCome on and wrap that blade of grass\nAnd we'll make it last"
