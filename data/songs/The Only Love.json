  "lyrics": "I can relate\nThe story of my life\nNo brighter hope\nNo stronger emotion\nI believed I could die over you\nHow you could ever\nBreak down and never see me through\nThrough my darkest night\nAnd as I lie awake\nOne prayer within me burning\nAnd there's no price on what you hold\nTill it's gone\nAnd it keeps moving on\nWhere is my heart\nYou know I will be waiting to be\nA part of you\nYou'll never feel the pain\nHow can you say to me\nThat I should go on living\nI left the only life I had with you\nThe only love\nNo use in me pretending to be\nA part of you\nAnd you the heart of me\nHow can you say to me\nThat I should go on living\nI left the only life I had with you\n\nSo we agree\nTo let each other go\nNo long goodbye\nJust your way and my way\nAnd I can stand how you cried to be free\nHigh as the wind blows\nBut not enough to bring you home to me\nAnd only lonely knows\nYou see my open arms\nYou know my flame is burning\nBut I'm too blind to see the end has begun\nAnd it keeps movin' on\nThe only love\nNo use in me pretending to be\nA part of you\nAnd you the heart of me\nHow can you say to me\nThat I should go on living\nI left the only life I had with you\nThe only love\nOne love that will not die\nI may sorry that I built my\nWorld around you\nThe only love\nIs only you and I\nThere will be others who would\nLeave you as I found you\n\nThe only love\nOne love that will not die\nI may sorry that I built my\nWorld around you\nThe only love\nIs only you and I\nThere will be others who would\nLeave you as I found you"
