She can see through his lies and call him out on his bull.\n[Verse 1]\nHow come you're so understanding\nWhen I tell you all my lies?\nAnd pretending to believe them\nSee through all my alibis\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd I want you till the end, Chloe\n[Verse 2]\nHow you handle what you live through\nI can never hope to learn\nTaking all the pain I give you\nLoving blindly in return\nAnd I need you more than ever\nI will always be your friend, Chloe\nChloe\n[Chorus]\nChloe, what you gonna do 'bout me?\nChloe, what you gonna do?\nWhat you going to do 'bout me?\n[Verse 3]\nYou're the lifeline that I cling to\nWhen I feel like giving in\nWhen the dreams that I rely on\nStart to wear a little thin\nThen I need you more than ever\nAnd I want you till the end, Chloe, mm\nChloe\n\n[Chorus]\nChloe, what you gonna do 'bout me?\nChloe, what you gonna do?\nWhat you gonna do about me?\n[Verse 4]\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd I want you till the end, Chloe, mm\nChloe\n[Chorus]\nChloe, what you gonna do 'bout me?\nChloe, what you gonna do?\nWhat you gonna do 'bout me?\nWhat you gonna do 'bout me?"
