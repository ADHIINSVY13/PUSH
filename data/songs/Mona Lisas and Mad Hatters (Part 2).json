  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nI used to think that New York City\nFell from grace with God\nAnd innocence abroad\nWaged a war for the underdog\nWhen the snow falls\nAnd Central Park looks like a Christmas card\nI just looked beyond the bagman\nAnd the madness that makes this city hard\nI heard a basketball\nSomewhere out beyond a chain link fence\nInner city prisoners\nArgue for the right of self defense\nBut there's a fast break\nAnd every work of art wakes something in the soul\nJust focus on the brush strokes\nAnd the bouquets that the dancers hold\n[Chorus]\nSpanish Harlem still sounds good to me\nYeah Mona Lisa's getting older\nStanding in the shadow of Miss Liberty\nWhile I walk along the west side\nDown through Little Italy\nSearching for the city\nThat took away the kid in me\n\n[Chorus]\nSpanish Harlem still sounds good to me\nYeah Mona Lisa's getting older\nStanding in the shadow of Miss Liberty\nWhile I walk along the west side\nDown through Little Italy\nSearching for the city\nThat took away the kid in me\n[Chorus]\nSpanish Harlem still sounds good to me\nYeah Mona Lisa's getting older\nStanding in the shadow of Miss Liberty\nWhile I walk along the west side\nDown through Little Italy\nSearching for the city\nThat took away the kid in me"
