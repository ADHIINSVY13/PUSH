Look her over once or twice\nNow, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?\n[Verse 2]\nJust cast an eye in her direction\nMe, oh, my ain't that perfection?\nI repeat, don't you think that's kinda neat?\nAnd I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?\n[Verse 1]\nAin't she sweet? See her coming down the street\nNow, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?\nAin't she nice? Look her over once or twice\nNow, I ask you very confidentially, ain't she nice?\n[Verse 2]\nJust cast an eye in her direction\nMe, oh, my ain't that perfection?\nI repeat, don't you think that's kinda neat?\nAnd I ask you very confidentially, ain't she\n[Outro]\nAin't she sweet!"
