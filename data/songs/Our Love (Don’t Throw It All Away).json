  "lyrics": "Maybe I don't want to know the reason why\nBut lately you don't talk to me\nDarling, I can't see me in your eyes\nI hold you near, but you're so far away\nAnd it's losing you I can't believe\nTo watch you leave and let this feeling die\nYou alone are the living thing that keeps me alive\nAnd tomorrow, if I'm here without your love\nYou know I can't survive\nOnly my love can raise you high above it all\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\nWe can take the darkness, make if full of light\nBut let your love flow back to me\nHow can you leave and let this feeling die?\nThis happy room would be a lonely place when you are gone\nAnd I won't even have your shoulder for the crying on\nNo other woman's love could be as true , I'm begging you\n\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\nWe changed the world, we made it ours to hold\nBut dreams are made for those who really try\nThis losing you is real, but I still feel you here inside\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\nDon't throw it all away, our love\n(repeat last verse at least twice more and fade out)"
