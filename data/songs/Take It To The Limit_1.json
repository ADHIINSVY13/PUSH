  "lyrics": "All alone at the end of the of the evening\nWhen the bright lights have faded to blue\nI was thinking 'bout a man who might have loved me\nAnd I never knew\nYou know I've always\nI've always been a dreamer\nSpent my life running 'round\nAnd it's so hard to change\nCan't seem to settle down\nBut the dreams I've seen lately\nKeep on turning out and burning out\nAnd turning out the same, same\nSo put me on a highway\nAnd show, show me a sign\nAnd take it to the limit one more time\nYou can spend all your time, spend all your time making money\nOh and you can spend all, spend all your love making time\nBut if it all fell to pieces tomorrow\nWould you still, would you still be mine?\nAnd when you're looking\nWhen you're looking for your freedom\nNobody seems to care\nYou can't find the door\nCan't find it anywhere\n\nWhen there's nothing\nNothing to believe in\nStill you're running back\nYou keep coming back\nYou're running back for more\nPut me on a highway\nAnd show me, show me a sign\nTake it to the limit one more time\nTake it to the limit\nTake it to the limit\nTake it to the limit\nTake it to the limit one more time\nTake it to the limit\nTake it, take it to the limit\nTake it to the limit\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nOh yeah\nOh no\nOh oh\nTake it to limit, one more time"
