(\nWhenever I'm back in the\n, \nah\n)\nOr do you wanna be famous? (\nWoo\n, \nyeah\n)\n[Verse 2: Travis Scott]\nI took the top off\nLike she took her lil' blouse off\nToo hard to go drop off\nYou know that boy not soft\nI never would travel\nSo I need me a time vault\nI been up in Cabo\nWith my Bailey Osanto\nIn this world, look around, yo\nIt's just mano y mano\nI might still eat McDonald's\nBut don't think I'm a Ronald\nI went back to my land\nMove like Moses, walkin' over seas\nIn my state because the country\nEvery part of it is part of me\nTell your parliament, \"Pardon me\" (Woo)\nOff the saké, turned to Socrates (Woo)\nHeavy moments on the ground\nFeel it shapin' in the sound\n'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house\nAnd you know that we down\nIf yo' ass don't know nothin'\nGotta know that it's time\nI'm excited to jump in\nSo much that I'm flyin'\nPut you right in the function\nTook you right off a vine\nGot this shit in a bind\nWe got it, we got it now (\nAh, woo\n)\nWhenever I'm duckin' it (\nAh, woo\n)\n\n[Outro: The Weeknd]\nI'm waiting on a let go\nI'm waiting on a let go\nI know myself, I know exactly how to make you special\nGo, collect your fame\nI'm waiting in an echo\nI'm waiting in an echo\n'Cause you keep callin' back, I thought I told you that we do not\nSorry, I didn't let you out\nOut, woah-oh\n(Out)\n(Out, woah-oh)"
