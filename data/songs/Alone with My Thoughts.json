  "lyrics": "Let's try a test\nThrough space and through time\nI'll whisper your name\nIt'll bounce down the line\nSlowly explode into showers of shine\nTo love from a distance through waves of the air\nTo know your sadness, your joy and your fears\nAre running around without me to be near\nOoh, ooh\nAlone with my thoughts, with my thoughts I'm alone\nI toil away and distract in a song\nI'll send you a prayer and a piece of home\nMy love is for you\nMy love is for you"
