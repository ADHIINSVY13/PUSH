  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI knew a boy once when I was small\nA towhead blond with eyes of salt\nHe played the drum in the marching band\nHis parents cared more about the Bible\nThan being good to their own child\nHe wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad\nAnd somehow, we fell out of touch\nHope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush\nDon't know if I'll see you again someday\nBut if you're out there, I hope that you're okay\n[Verse 2]\nMy middle school friend grew up alone\nShe raised her brothers on hеr own\nHer parents hated who shе loved\nShe couldn't wait to go to college\nShe was tired 'cause she was brought into a world\nWhere family was merely blood\nDoes she know how proud I am she was created\nWith the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?\nWe don't talk much, but I just gotta say\nI miss you and I hope that you're okay\n[Bridge]\nAddress the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings\nNothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems\nAnd when the clouds won't iron out\nAnd the monsters creep into your house\nAnd every door is hard to close\n\n[Outro]\nWell, I hope you know how proud I am you were created\nWith the courage to unlearn all of their hatred\nBut, God, I hope that you're happier today\n'Cause I love you\nAnd I hope that you're okay"
