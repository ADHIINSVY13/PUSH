  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI built a house for a love to grow\nI was so young that it was hard to know\nI'm as lost now as I was back then\nAlways make a mess of everything\nIt's about time that I face myself\nAll I do is bleed into someone else\nPainting walls with all my secret tears\nFilling rooms with all my hopes and fears\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut, oh my\nOh my\nI'll never learn if I never leap\nI'll always yearn if I never speak\n[Chorus]\nTo be loved and love at the highest count\nMeans to lose all the things I can't live without\nLet it be known that I will choose to lose\nIt's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie\nLet it be known, let it be known that I tried\n[Verse 2]\nI'm so afraid, but I'm open wide\nI'll be the one to catch myself this time\nTryna learn to lean into it all\nAin't it funny how the mighty fall?\nLooking back, I don't regret a thing\nYeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning\nI'll stand still and let the storm pass by\nKeep my heart safe till the time feels right\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut, oh my\nOh my\nI'll never learn if I never leap\nI'll always yearn if I never speak\n[Chorus]\nTo be loved and love at the highest count\nMeans to lose all the things I can't live without\nLet it be known that I will choose to lose\nIt's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie\nLet it be known\n[Bridge]\nLet it be known that I cried for you\nEven started lying to you\nWhat a thing to do\nAll because I wanted\n[Chorus]\nTo be loved and love at the highest count\nMeans to lose all the things I can't live without\nLet it be known, known, known\nThat I will choose, I will lose\nIt's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie\nLet it be known\nLet it be known that I tried, that I tried\nLet it be known that I tried"
