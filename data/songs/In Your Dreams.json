I don't know, I don't even understand it\nBut it's simply overstood how you really 'posed to handle it\nPardon me one moment, I just went off on a tangent\nHa ha ha ha\n[Hook: Janelle Monae & \nSleepy Brown\n]\nWe spent summer dreaming\nWhen we could be leaving\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n\n[Verse 2: Killer Mike]\nTypical day off in the A, aye\nBut Nicks own the Chevrolet, aye\nNigga wanna rob, okay, okay\nWhere he stand is where he lay, aye\nKeep looking at me with a gangsta grill\nI'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill\nThat's a little piece of lead, taken to the head\nThat nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead\nTaken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes\nDone like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas\nBig Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare\nI will bust their motherfuckin' head\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n[Hook: Janelle Monae & \nSleepy Brown\n]\nWe spent summer dreaming\nWhen we could be leaving\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n\n[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]\nYou're ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nWe roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nAs the wheels...\nKeep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nNow we knowin', holdin', showin', controllin'\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\n[Hook: Janelle Monae & \nSleepy Brown\n]\nWe spent summer dreaming\nWhen we could be leaving\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nOut here wild and don't give a fuck\nSee you when the sun come up\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n\n[Outro: Janelle Manae]\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams..."
