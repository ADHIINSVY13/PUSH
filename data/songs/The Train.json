This song also contains dialogue from the movie this album is for.\n[Intro]\nAll aboard\nOr, are all y'all bored?\nIt's good to have y'all back now\nLadies and gents\nY'all already know what it is\n(God don't make no mistakes)\n(God don't make no mistakes)\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nLittle do they know when I was brought up in this game\n'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change\nLike the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter\nI wasn't ready to be no father – maybe, kinda, sorta\n'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall\nNot tears of sorrow, but of joy, so listen here, y'all\nI grabbed the mic and moved the crowd, then disappeared, dog\nBack in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy\nThen that '\nSouthernplayalistic\n...' went Platinum\nStacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes\nWalking around the table in the kitchen, just for practice\nReciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nIt's been a good long road\nNow its time for me to go\nI say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nTime to spread my wings\nSo high up in the sky\nI can fly, I fly, I fly, so high\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nWelcome to my life, I think it's time I take it back\nI got to give you all the facts, so you can see what type of cat\nThat you dealing with\nNow on '\nATLiens\n', we was killing it\nAnd then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it\nThe first person close to me to die, I needed healing\nBut I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling\nLike my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders, steady chilling\nSo you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning\nIt's your birthday, even on your worst day\nLive it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre\nOr General Patton,\n \nif you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or '\nGot Purp\n'\n\"I, I be on that Kryptonite\" – that means I can't be hurt\n(Gotta leave this place, it's been cool, but I got to go...)\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nIt's been a good long road\nNow its time for me to go\nI say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nTime to spread my wings\nSo high up in the sky\nI can fly, I fly, I fly, so high\n[Bridge]\nEven on the train\nSurely as truth remains\nI'll be back again\n(Know we been through a lot, and I ain't perfect\nBut I swear to you I'm a changed man)\nEven on the train\nSurely as truth remains\nI'll be back again\n(From the caboose)\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nAnd now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose\nI was all about my team, but now I call upon my crew\nI'm a family type of person, but I'm deadly dolo too\nYou can achieve anything that you put your heart into\nSee the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock\nThe nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock\n'Cause when your faith is in the right place, see, He ain't gon' let you flop\nYou can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) – Boi, stop!!\n[Bridge]\nBefore you say you can't hit goal\nPlease, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly\nYou never know what day the doors will close\nIt's time to say goodbye, time to pack up and ride\nGot to leave this place, it's been cool, but I gotta go\n(I can take it from here, ladies; y'all done a good deed tonight)\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nIt's been a good long road\nNow its time for me to go\nI say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nTime to spread my wings\nSo high up in the sky\nI can fly, I fly, I fly, so high"
