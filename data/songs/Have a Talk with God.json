  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere are people who have let the problems of today\nLead them to conclude that for them, life is not the way\nBut every problem has an answer and if yours, you cannot find\nYou should talk it over to Him, He'll give you peace of mind\n[Chorus]\nWhen you feel your life's too hard\nJust go have a talk with God\n[Verse 2]\nMany of us feel we walk alone without a friend\nNever communicating with the One who lives within\nForgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down\nAnd you can talk to Him anytime, He's always around\n[Chorus]\nWhen you feel your life's too hard\nJust go have a talk with God\n[Verse 3]\nWell, He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world\nFor solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls\n[Chorus]\nWhen you feel your life's too hard\nJust go have a talk with God\nWhen you feel your life's too hard\nJust go have a talk with God\nWhen your load's too much to bear\nJust go talk to God, He cares (I know he does)\nWhen you feel your life's too hard\nJust go have a talk with God\n\n[Outro]\nThank you\n(\nThank you very much\n)"
