  "lyrics": "The spoken introduction to David Bowie’s 1974 album, Diamond Dogs, sets the concept album’s post-apocalyptic scene. It smoothly transitions into the title track.\n[Intro]\nAwooo\n[Monologue]\nAnd in the death\n, as the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare, \nthe shutters lifted an inch in temperance building,\n high on Poacher's Hill and red mutant eyes gazed down on \nHunger City.\n \nNo more big wheels.\n \nFleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats\n \nand ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes,\n \ncoveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers\n \nlike packs of dogs\n assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue. \nRipping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers\n. Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald. \nAny day now,\n the year of the Diamond Dogs\n[Outro]\n\"\nThis ain't rock and roll! This is genocide!\n\""
