  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was twenty-four years old\nWhen I met the woman I would call my own\nTwenty-two grand kids now growin' old\nIn that house that your brother bought ya\nOn the summer day when I proposed\nI made that wedding ring from dentist gold\nAnd I asked her father, but her daddy said, \"No\nYou can't marry my daughter\"\n[Chorus]\nShe and I went on the run\nDon't care about religion\nI'm gonna marry the woman I love\nDown by the Wexford border\nShe was Nancy Mulligan\nAnd I was William Sheeran\nShe took my name and then we were one\nDown by the Wexford border\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I met her at Guy's in the second World War\nAnd she was workin' on a soldier's ward\nNever had I seen such beauty before\nThe moment that I saw her\nNancy was my yellow rose\nAnd we got married wearin' borrowed clothes\nWe got eight children now growin' old\nFive sons and three daughters\n\n[Chorus]\nShe and I went on the run\nDon't care about religion\nI'm gonna marry the woman I love\nDown by the Wexford border\nShe was Nancy Mulligan\nAnd I was William Sheeran\nShe took my name and then we were one\nDown by the Wexford border\n[Verse 3]\nFrom her snow-white streak in her jet-black hair\nOver sixty years I've been lovin' her\nNow we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs\nYou know, Nancy, I adore ya\nFrom a farm boy born near Belfast town\nI never worried 'bout the king and crown\n'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground\nThere's no difference, I assure ya\n[Chorus]\nShe and I went on the run\nDon't care about religion\nI'm gonna marry the woman I love\nDown by the Wexford border\nShe was Nancy Mulligan\nAnd I was William Sheeran\nShe took my name and then we were one\nDown by the Wexford border"
