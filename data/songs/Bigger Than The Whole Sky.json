  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNo words appear before me in the aftermath\nSalt streams out my eyes and into my ears\nEvery single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness\n'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nYou were bigger than the whole sky\nYou were more than just a short time\nAnd I've got a lot to pine about\nI've got a lot to live without\nI'm never gonna meet\nWhat could've been, would've been\nWhat should've been you\nWhat could've been, would've been you\n[Verse 2]\nDid some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?\nDid some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?\nEvery single thing to come has turned into ashes\n'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be\nSo I'll say words I don't believe\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nYou were bigger than the whole sky\nYou were more than just a short time\nAnd I've got a lot to pine about\nI've got a lot to live without\nI'm never gonna meet\nWhat could've been, would've been\nWhat should've been you\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat could've been, would've been you\nWhat could've been, would've been\nWhat should've been you\nWhat could've been, would've been you\n(What could've been, would've been you)\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nYou were bigger than the whole sky\nYou were more than just a short time\nAnd I've got a lot to pine about\nI've got a lot to live without\nI'm never gonna meet\nWhat could've been, would've been\nWhat should've been you"
