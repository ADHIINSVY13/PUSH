  "lyrics": "I won't dance, don't ask me\nI won't dance, don't ask me\nI won't dance, madame, with you\nMy heart won't let my feet do things that they should do\nYou know what? You're lovely\nYou know what? You're so lovely\nAnd, oh, what you do to me\nI'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore\nI feel so absolutely stumped on the floor\nWhen you dance, you're charming and you're gentle\n'Specially when you do \nthe Continental\nBut this feeling isn't purely mental\nFor Heaven rest us, I am not \nasbestos\nAnd that's why I won't dance, why should I?\nI won't dance, how could I?\nI won't dance, merci beaucoup\nI know that music leads the way to romance\nSo If I hold you in my arms, I won't dance\nI won't dance, don't ask me\nI won't dance, don't ask me\nI won't dance, madame with you\nMy heart won't let my feet do things that they want to do\n\nYou know what? You're lovely\nRing-a-ding-ding, you're lovely\nAnd, oh, what you do to me\nI'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore\nI feel so absolutely stumped on the floor\nWhen you dance, you're charming and you're gentle\n'Specially when you do the Continental\nBut this feeling isn't purely mental\nFor Heaven rest us, I am not asbestos\nAnd that's why\nI won't dance\nI won't dance\nI won't dance, merci beaucoup\nI know that music leads the way to romance\nSo If I hold you in my arms\nI won't dance"
