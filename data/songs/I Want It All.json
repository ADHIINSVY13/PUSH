  "lyrics": "In a typical rock star mentality, Alex wants every lovely encounter with a beautiful woman to keep on. Heâ€™s just so damn eloquent about it all.\n[Verse 1]\nBlind faith, heartache\nMind games, mistakes\nMy sweet fireball\nMy sweet rigmarole\n[Chorus]\nI want it all\nI want it all\n[Verse 2]\nOld dogs, new tricks\nCan you feel it?\nSpace age country girl\nStone cold miracle\n[Chorus]\nI want it all\nI want it all\n[Bridge]\nAnd then suddenly it hit me, it's a year ago\nSince I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke\nSaid, ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?\nLeave me listening to the Stones' \"2000 Light Years from Home\"\nShoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop\nShoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop\nShoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop\n\n[Chorus]\nI want it all\nI want it all\nI want it all\nI want it all\nI want it all"
