I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said \"You know what, girl? You crazy.\" Then she asked me what he said...\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & \nMani Strings\n]\n(\nWhat did the Asian say?\n)\n \n\"A peace of mind\"\nThat's what the Asian said—I need a divine\nIntervention was his religion and I was surprised\nHim believing in Buddha, me believing in God\nAsked him \"What are you doing?,\" he said \"Taking my time\nMeditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try\nSee you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself\nWorried about your career, you ever think of your health?\"\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & \nMani Strings\n]\n(\nWhat did the Indian say?\n)\n \n\"A piece of land\"\nThat's what the Indian said—I needed the man\nTelling me \"Longevity is in the dirt\nShould buy some property first\nShould profit a better dollar with generational perks\nEquity at his best, really, you should invest\nThese tangible things expire, don't you expect\nIncome with so much outcome and yes\nLook at my heritage, we blessed\"\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & \nMani Strings\n]\n(\nNow, what the black man say?\n)\n \n\"A piece of pussy\"\nThat's what the black man said, I needed to push me\nTo the limit, to satisfy my hunger\nWe do it all for a woman from haircut to a war\nWe like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach\nWhat you saying to me?\nHe said, \"Nigga, come back to reality for a week\"\nPussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night\nI wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & \nMani Strings\n]\n(\nWhat the white man say?\n)\n \nA piece of mine's\nThat's what the white man wanted when I rhyme\nTelling me that he selling me just for $10.99\nIf I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine\nWhat if I compromise? He said \"It don't even matter\nYou make a million or more, you living better than average\nYou losing your core following, gaining it all\"\nHe put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw\nHit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw\nPut myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars\n\"Look at what you accomplishing\" – what he said to the boy\n\"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore\nYour profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market\nIf you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet\nA lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet\nYour world tour, your masters, mortgage, I need a piece\"\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nI holler, \"What you do? What you say?\"\nI shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today\nI holler, \"What you do? What you say?\"\nI shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today\n[Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin]\n\n[Outro]\nWhat the black man say?\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply"
