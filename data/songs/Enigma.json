(What?)\nDid you hear what I said? (Yeah)\nIs it all in my head?\nIs it all in my head? (Ooh, yeah)\nIs it all in my head?\n[Chorus]\nWe could be lovers, even just tonight\nWe could be anything you want\nWe could be jokers, brought to the daylight\nWe could break all of our stigma\nI'll, I'll be your enigma, even just tonight\nI'll, I'll be your enigma, brought to the daylight\nI'll, I'll be your enigma, even just tonight\nI'll, I'll be your enigma, brought to the daylight, daylight"
