  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\n\"An extremely quiet child\" they called you in your school report\n\"He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught\"\nSo what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive\nTo notify your parents of the manner in which you died?\n[Verse 2]\nAt St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins\n\"Oh, he's unconcerned with competition, he never cares to win\"\nBut blood stained a young hand that never held a gun\nAnd his parents never thought of him as their troubled son\n[Chorus]\n\"Now you'll never get to Heaven,\" Mama said\nRemember Mama said\nTicking, ticking\n\"Grow up straight and true blue\nRun along to bed\"\nHear it, hear it, ticking, ticking\n[Verse 3]\nThey had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest\nSome gook said, \"His brain's just snapped\" then someone called the police\nYou'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down\nOh, you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground\n\n[Verse 4]\nPromising to hurt no one, providing they were still\nA young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed\n(You killed)\nThat gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm\nOh, your childhood cried out in your head, \"They mean to do you harm\"\n[Chorus]\n\"Don't ever ride on the devil's knee,\" Mama said\nRemember Mama said\nTicking, ticking\n\"Pay your penance well, my child\nFear where angels tread\"\nHear it, hear it, ticking, ticking\n[Verse 5]\nWithin an hour the news had reached the media machine\nA male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens\nThe area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school\nFourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule\n[Verse 6]\nOh, they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside\n\"Throw out your gun, walk out slow, just keep your hands held high\"\nBut they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door\nOh, you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law\n\n[Chorus]\n\"You've slept too long in silence,\" Mama said\nRemember Mama said\nTicking, ticking\n\"Crazy boy, you'll only wind up\nWith strange notions in your head\"\nHear it, hear it, ticking, ticking"
