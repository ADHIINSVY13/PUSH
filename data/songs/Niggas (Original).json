Well fuck it, I’m the high guy\nFrom Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye\nAnd your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing\nAnd when Jake come, I'm leaving\n\n[Chorus: \nCurtis Mayfield\n, Guru]\nNiggas!\nNiggas!\nNiggas better know, I paid my dues and shit\nNiggas!\nNiggas!\nNiggas better know, I paid my dues and shit"
