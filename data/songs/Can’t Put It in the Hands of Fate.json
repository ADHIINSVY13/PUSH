Yeah\n\n[Verse 3: Stevie Wonder]\nYou say you're sick and tired of us protesting\nI say, \"Not tired enough to make a change\"\nYou say, \"Just you hold on\"\nI say \"No way, 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate\"\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, now, baby, uh\nYou say that you believe that all lives matter\nI say, I don't believe the fuck you do\nYou say, \"All things in time\"\nI say, \"That's why I'm not gonna put it in the hands of fate\"\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & \nStevie Wonder\n]\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNot gon' put it in the hands of fate now, baby\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo, no, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate now, baby\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\n[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]\nIn the not so distant tomorrow\nRobins will sing your lullaby\nBut I've seen too many of our generations\nLive and die for that pie in the sky\n\n[Verse 4: Stevie Wonder]\nYou say, \"Those innocent lives should've not been taken\"\nAnd I say, \"For them is why we take a knee\"\nYou say, \"Is that the right play?\"\nI say, \"First Amendment everyday 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate\"\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & \nStevie Wonder\n]\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate now, baby\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo, no, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nWe can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCome on\n[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]\nIn the not so distant tomorrow\n (Yeah)\nRobins will sing your lullaby\n (Woah)\nBut I've seen too many of our generations\nLive and die for that pie in the sky\n[Verse 5: CHIKA & \nStevie Wonder\n]\nYeah, we went from fields into a field\nBodies hittin' the ground, and so we gotta take a kneel\nMothers missin', kid's attorneys say they oughta take a deal\nThey determine that the price of life is just a couple mill'\nAnd bricks are meant to build, and fire's meant to light\nAnd souls are meant to rest and living soldiers gotta fight\nWe don't need no politics to try to justify the plight\nIt's a problem of the people, it's no longer black and white (\nYeah\n)\n\n[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]\nLook, said we ain't talkin' no more, we gettin' to it (Ha)\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, this how we do it (Ha)\nNow let me go and get with all of my people, you know I have to get\nThat'll show me sacrifice just like my brother Colin Kaepernick\nOpportunities that I get to talk, you know I have to spit\nBreonna Taylor turn in her grave, you know we have to get justice\nAnd stay in your place, we still focused on the outcome of George Floyd case (Floyd case)\nWhile you out here doin' the minimal (Ha)\nEverything about us still live by the principle (Ha)\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\n[Verse 7: Stevie Wonder]\nYou say now you really truly get it\nI say, \"How much you do will let me know\"\nYou say, \"I'm so ready\"\nI say, \"Let's do this, and not just put it in the hands of fate\"\n[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & \nStevie Wonder\n]\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate now, baby\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo, no, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nWe can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nNo, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nOh, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nOh, no, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nOh, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nOh, no, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nA-no, no, no\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait\nCan't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait"
