Blige \"Reminisce\" on\nI hear his voice in my mind like, \"Nigga, live on\"\nSo I get on that fly shit I been on\nSpin on corners in Enzo with rims on\nBut for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia\nGive me amnesia\nI ease up, that right, I'm high, nigga\nI want the sky\nThe world when I'm done\nI'm give it to my sons\nLet 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh\n6's kitted up – man, I did it up, done\nThe rest of my belongings belong in the Hall of Fame\nA list of hits next to all my names\nI came\n\n[Bridge]\n(Woo!) Uh-huh (Gyeah)\nI want the sky, baby\nI want the sky, baby\n[Verse 2]\nIf the sky should fall\nAnd it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house\nAnd auction off all my cars\nDon't cry for me, Argentina\n – \nI mobbed the Bimmer\nTook trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia\nIn Ibiza, I had pizza in the club\nLadies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love\nNow they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime\n\"Billie Jean – the goddamn boy ain't mine\"\nAnd the Roc break up, had the people losing hope\nCan't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes\nNow I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's\nThrowing the diamond up, repping the logo\nRose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though\nWhat don't kill me makes stronger than before, so\n\"Here we go\" – and I'm not Domino\nWhen it \"All Falls Down,\" I'm like Kanye's jaw – I might break, but I don't fold\n'Til I hold the sky in my hand\n – yeah, that's my goal\nAnd then I bid you Freddy Adu\nProdigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture\nThen I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle\nMy name will be viewed as such\nHere's to the man who refused to give up\nI want the sky, nigga – chuuurch\n\n[Outro]\nI want the sky, baby\nI want the sky, baby"
