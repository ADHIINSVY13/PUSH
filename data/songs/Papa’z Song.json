Tell me the answer\nMoms ignores me and avoids me like cancer\nGrow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff\nMoms was tough 'cause papa wasn't man enough\nCouldn't stand up to his own responsibilities\nInstead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly\nThat's why I'll never be a father\nUnless you got the time, it's a crime; don't even bother\nThat's when I started hatin' the phony smiles\nSaid I was an only child\nLook at mama's lonely smile\nIt's hard for a son to see his mother cry\nShe only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys\nI'm so sorry\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sorry (So, so-so)\nFor all this time (So, so-so)\nFor all this time (So sorry) (Indo)\nFor all this time\nI'm so sorry\nFor all this time\nFor all this time (So sorry)\nFor all this time, so sorry, baby\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nMan child in the promised land, couldn't afford many heroes\nMoms was the only one there, my pops was a no-show\nAnd, oh, I guess ya didn't know\nThat I would grow to be so strong\nLookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?\nWhere was the money that you said you would send me?\nTalked on the phone and you sounded so friendly\nAsking 'bout school and my welfare\nBut it's clear, you ain't sincere, hey, who the hell cares?\nYou think I'm blind, but this time I see you comin', Jack\nYou grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back\nAsking 'bout my moms like you loved her from the start\nLeft her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart\nSo don't even start with that \"Wanna be a father\" shit\nDon't even bother with your dollars, I don't need it\nI'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G\nNow that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me\nYou're so sorry\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sorry (So sorry)\nFor all this time (So, I'm so— so, so sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so, so sorry)\nFor all this time (Fuck that)\nI'm so sorry\nFor all this time (So, so, so sorry)\nFor all this time (So, so sorry)\nFor all this time, so sorry, baby\n[Verse 4: 2Pac]\nI never meant to leave, but I was wanted\nCrossed too many people, every house I'd touch was haunted\nHad to watch the strangers, every brother was a danger\nIf I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a\nHad to move on, done lost my name and picked a number\nMade me watch my back, I had no happy home to run to\nMaybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast\nBut livin' slow mean half the dough and you won't get no ass\nHindsight shows me it was wrong all along\nI wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong\nIt took a little longer than I thought\nI slipped, got caught and sent to jail by the courts\nNow, I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand\nAll I ever wanted was for you to be a man\nAnd grow to be the titan you was meant to be\nKeep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me\nI'm so sorry\n[Chorus]\nI'm so sorry (So, so sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so sorry)\nFor all this time (Ticka-ticka-ticka, sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so sorry)\nI'm so sorry (So sorry)\nFor all this time (So, so, so sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so sorry)\nFor all this time, so sorry, baby (I'm so— I'm so— I'm so— I'm so—)\nSorry (I'm so sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so sorry)\nFor all this time (So sorry)\nI'm so sorry (So, so sorry)\nFor all this time (So, so sorry)\nFor all this time (I'm so sorry)\nFor all this time, so sorry, baby (I'm so sorry)\n[Outro]\nSorry\nI'm so sorry\nI'm so sorry\nI'm so sorry\nI'm so sorry\nI'm so sorry\nI'm so sorry"
