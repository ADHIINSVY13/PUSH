  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nRaised to be a lady by the golden rule\nAlice was the spawn of a public school\nWith a double barrel name in the back of her brain\nAnd a simple case of \"Mummy doesn't love me\" blues\n[Verse 2]\nReality it seems was just a dream\nShe couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene\nBut what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?\nAnd hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey), you know what I mean\n[Chorus]\nAll the young girls love Alice\nTender young Alice, they say\nCome over and see me\nCome over and please me\nAlice, it's my turn today\nAll the young girls love Alice\nTender young Alice, they say\nIf I give you my number\nWill you promise to call me?\nWait till my husband's away\n[Verse 3]\nPoor little darling with a chip out of her heart\nIt's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part\nGetting your kicks in another girl's bed\nAnd it was only last Tuesday, oh, they found you in the subway dead\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd who could you call your friends down in SoHo?\nOne or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go\nBut what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo?\nAnd hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey), oh, donâ€™t you know?\n[Chorus]\nAll the young girls love Alice\nTender young Alice, they say\nCome over and see me\nCome over and please me\nAlice, it's my turn today\nAll the young girls love Alice\nTender young Alice, they'd say\nIf I give you my number\nWill you promise to call me?\nWait till my husband's away"
