  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBought a bunch of makeup, tryna cover up my face\nI started to skip lunch, \nstopped eatin' cake on birthdays\nI bought a new prescription to try and stay calm\n'Cause there's always somethin' missin'\nThere's always somethin' in the mirror that I think looks wrong\n[Chorus]\nWhen pretty isn't pretty enough, what do you do?\nAnd everybody's keepin' it up, so you think it's you\nI could change up my body and change up my face\nI could try every lipstick in every shade\nBut I'd always feel the same\n'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyway\n[Verse 2]\nYou can win the battle, but you'll never win the war\nYou fix thе things you hated, and you'd still feel so insecure\nAnd I try to ignorе it, but it's everythin' I see\nIt's on the poster on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines\nIt's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed\nIt's all around, it's all the time, I don't know why I even try\n[Chorus]\nWhen pretty isn't pretty enough, what do you do?\nAnd everybody's keepin' it up, so you think it's you\nI could change up my body and change up my face\nI could try every lipstick in every shade\nBut I'd always feel the same\n'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy\nI chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life\nAnd none of it matters, and none of it ends\nYou just feel like shit over and over again\n[Outro]\nNo, it'll never change\nPretty isn't pretty enough, mmm\nEverybody's keepin' it up, oh\nPretty isn't pretty enough\nPretty isn't"
