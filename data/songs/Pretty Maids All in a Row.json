  "lyrics": "The first song sung by Joe Walsh after he joined The Eagles, Pretty Maids All In A Row depicts the meeting of old friends or lovers, and the feelings that come from such an event.\n[Verse 1]\nHi there, how are you? It's been a long time\nSeems like we've come a long way\nMy, but we learn so slow\nAnd heroes, they come and they go\nAnd leave us behind as if we're supposed to know\nWhy\nWhy\nWhy do we give up our hearts to the past?\nAnd why must we grow up so fast?\n[Verse 2]\nAnd all you wishing well fools with your fortunes\nSomeone should send you a rose\nWith love from a friend, it's nice to hear from you again\nAnd the storybook comes to a close\nGone are the ribbons and bows\nThings to remember, places to go\nPretty maids all in a row"
