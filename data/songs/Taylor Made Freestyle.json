I woulda refused\nFuck these industry relationships, she not in your shoes\nYou supposed to be the boogeyman, go do what you do\nUnless this is a moment that you tell us this not really you\nIn that case, there's nothin' left to say, I'll just pass it to Snoop\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg (AI)]\nNephew, what the fuck you really 'bout to do?\nWe passed you the torch at the House of Blues\nAnd now you gotta do some dirty work, you know how to move, right? Right?\nI know you never been to jail, orange jumpsuits and shower shoes\nNever shot nobody, never stabbed nobody\nNever did nothin' violent to no one, it's the homies that empower you\nBut still, you gotta show this fuckin' owl who's boss on the West\nNow's a time to really make a power move\n'Cause right now it's lookin' like you writin' out the game plan on how to lose\nHow to bark up the wrong tree and then get your head popped in a crowded room\nWorld is watchin' this chess game, but are you out of moves?\nDot, you know that the D-O-G never fuckin' doubted you\nBut right now it seem like you posted up without a clue\nOf what the fuck you 'bout to do\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nYeah, unc', that's the truth\nI'm definitely 'bout to come around the Lang gang and let my fuckin' bowel move\nShittin' on you niggas from a whole different altitude\nHigh up in the sky like I'm Howard Hughes\nThe first one really only took me an hour or two\nThe next one is really 'bout to bring out the coward in you\nBut now we gotta wait a fuckin' week 'cause Taylor Swift is your new Top\nAnd if you 'bout to drop, she gotta approve\nThis girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud\nShe tailor-made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop\nHate all you corporate industry puppets, I'm not in the mood\nI love it when you niggas talk loose like I'm not in the room\nSince \"Like That,\" your tone changed a little, you not as enthused\nHow are you not in the booth? It feel like you kinda removed\nYou tryna let this shit die down, nah, nah, nah\nNot this time, nigga, you followin' through\nI guess you need another week to figure out how to improve\nWhat the fuck is takin' so long? We waitin' on you\nThe rest of y'all are definitely involved, y'all gettin' it too\nSoon as you get the courage to drop, I'm out on the loose, on the loose\n\n[Outro: Drake]\nYeah, shout out to Taylor Swift\nBiggest gangster in the music game right now\nYou know, I moved my album when she dropped, I said that already\nYou know, she 'bout to milli' run through a Milly Rock on your head top, well\nShe got the whole pgLang on mute like that Beyonc√© challenge, y'all boys quiet for the weekend, like\nDot, I know you're in that NY apartment, you strugglin' right now, I know it\nIn the notepad doing lyrical gymnastics, my boy\nYou better have a motherfuckin' quintuple entendre on that shit\nSome shit I don't even understand, like\nThat shit better be crazy, we waitin' on you\nYeah"
