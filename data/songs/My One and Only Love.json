  "lyrics": "The very thought of you makes my heart sing\nLike an April breeze on the wings of spring\nAnd you appear in all your splendor\nMy one and only love\nThe shadows fall and spread their mystic charms\nIn the hush of night while you're in my arms\nI feel your lips so warm and tender\nMy one and only love\nThe touch of your hand is like heaven\nA heaven that I've never known\nThe blush on your cheek\nWhenever I speak\nTells me that you are my own\nYou fill my eager heart with such desire\nEvery kiss you give sets my soul on fire\nI give myself in sweet surrender\nMy one and only love\nThe touch of your hand is like heaven\nA heaven that I've never known\nAnd the blush on your cheek\nWhenever I speak\nTells me that you are my own\n\nYou fill my eager heart with such desire\nEvery kiss you give sets my soul on fire\nI give myself in sweet surrender\nMy one and only love\nMy one and only love"
