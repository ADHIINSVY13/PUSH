  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHere I am standing in the mirror, looking in my eyes\nTrying not to fool myself, and realize\nTimes are getting harder for us to get along\nEverything about this love is all going wrong\nYou keep on telling me to do this, do that\nAnd I need to change my ways\nBut I think that maybe the price of this love\nIs too high to pay\n[Chorus]\nBall and chain\nIs the feeling that I am feeling tonight\nWhen love's a, ball and chain\nIt don't matter who's wrong or right\n[Verse 2]\nI keep on living in confusion, wondering where I am at\nTrying to figure out if I should do this thing or that\nI can't see the future, and I can't change the past\nBut I'm feeling that this love of ours just ain't gonna last\nI've been down one time, two times, three times, four\nI've been waiting for times to get better\nAnd I can't take it no more\n[Chorus]\nBall and chain\nThat's the feeling that I am feeling tonight\nThis love's a, ball and chain\nIt don't matter who's wrong or right\n\n[Bridge]\nTime, I would love for time to be on our side\nBut I know that this love affair, is all over now\n[Outro]\nBall and chain\nIt's a feeling that I am feeling tonight\nThis love's a, ball and chain\nIt don't matter who's wrong or right\nThis love's a, ball and chain\nIt's a feeling that I am feeling inside\nWhen love's a, ball and chain\nIt don't matter who's wrong or right"
