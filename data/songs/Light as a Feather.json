  "lyrics": "While the seasons will undo your soul\nTime forgives us and it takes control\nWe separate our things to put us back together\nWe're light as a feather\nHeavy as the weather\nIf it was raining stones\nPut our hands together to applaud or pray\nIt's like the show was over\nBut we're too scared to walk away\nAll for the better, worse for the wear\nWe're light as a feather\nGod, you and I together\nMeanwhile inside me\nIt was raining stones\nYou didn't know\nGod bless your soul\nWe're light as a feather\nHeavy as the weather\nWe're light as a feather\nGod, you and I together"
