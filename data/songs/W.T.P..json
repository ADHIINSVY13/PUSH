You better ask somebody\n'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (White trash party)\n[Verse 2]\nPull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear\nAnd walk around the party without a care\nLike a body without a head\nLookin' like a zombie from \nNight of the Living Dead\nAnd tomorrow, I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed\n'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer\nMixin' Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta (Woo)\nI shoot the gift like I'm hollerin', “Die, Santa”\nMissed the tree, and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders (Yeah)\nSo quit tryna play the wall like you Paul\nAnd get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'\nThey call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'\n'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'\nMakin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's\nBut I'm not throwin' 1's, 5's, 10's or even 20's\nI'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies\nMan, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's\nFrom the North, East and West\nBut when it comes to them trailers in them South-parks\nMuffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's\nSo ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outtie\nNow hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy, come on!\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash\nYou don't know? You better ask somebody\n'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (White trash party)\n[Bridge]\nNow, whether you're black, white, or purple\nIf you're misunderstood\nBut you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should\nLong as you know you're up to evil, and you're no damn good\nGet on the floor, man, and rep your hood\n[Verse 3]\nNow, honey, don't let them pricks trip\nWe should make a quick dip\nAnd go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot\n'Cause, girl, I got a sick whip\nKick the back window out of my Gremlin\nPut two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift\nAnd make a 5-seater\n, I'll be damned if I feed a chick\nIt ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita\nI be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y\nAnd I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater\nI'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down\n'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown\nI'll tell you now, I'm so raw, I still need to unthaw\nYou feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall\nBut, baby, a body like that's against the law\nYou the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw\nColeslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all\nYou got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car\nNow get up\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash\nYou don't know? You better ask somebody\n'Cause we're havin' a white trash party (White trash party)"
