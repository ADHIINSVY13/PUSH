  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time\nAnd I'm running out of things to do to get you off my mind, Ooh\nAll I have is this picture in a frame\nThat I hold close to see your face everyday!\n[Hook]\nWith you is where I'd rather be\nBut we're stuck where we are\nAnd its so hard\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killing me\nI wish that you were here with me!\nBut we're stuck where we are\nAnd its so hard\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killing me!\nIts so hard, its so hard\nWhere we are, where we are\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killing me\nIts so hard, its so hard\nWhere we are, where we are\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killing me\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow the minutes feel like hours and the hours feel like days\nWhile I'm away\nAnd no right now I can't be home\nBut im comin' home soon\nComin' home soon\nAll I have is this picture in a frame\nThat I hold close to see your face again (OH!)\n[Hook]\nWith you is where i'd rather be\nBut we're stuck where we are\nAnd its so hard\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killin me\nI wish that you were here with me!\nBut we're stuck where we are\nAnd its so hard\nYou're so far\nCan you hear me crying?\n(Oooohhhhh)\nCan you hear me crying?\n(Oooohhhh)\nCan you hear me crying?\n(ooohhh ohhhhhh) oh oh oh oh ohh\n\n[Hook]\nWith you is where i'd rather be\nBut we're stuck where we are\nAnd its so hard\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killin me\nI wish that you were here with me\nBut we're stuck where we are\nAnd its so hard\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killin me\n[Hook]\nIts so hard, its so hard\nWhere we are, where we are\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killin me\nIts so hard, its so hard\nWhere we are, where we are\nYou're so far\nThis long distance is killin me\n[Outro]\nThere's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time"
