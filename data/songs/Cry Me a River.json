  "lyrics": "Now you say you're lonely\nYou cried the whole night through\nWell, you can cry me a river, cry me a river\nI cried a river over you\nNow you say you're sorry\nFor being so untrue\nWell, you can cry me a river, cry me a river\nI cried a river over you\nYou drove me, nearly drove me out of my head\nWhile you never shed a tear\nRemember? I remember all that you said\nTold me love was too plebeian\nTold me you were through with me\nAnd now you say you love me\nWell, just to prove you do\nCry me a river, cry me a river\nAnd I cried a river over you\nYeah\nYou drove me, nearly drove me out of my head\nWhile you never shed a tear\nRemember? I remember all that you said\nTold me love was too plebeian\nTold me you were through with me\n\nAnd now you say you love me\nWell, just to prove, just to prove you do\nCry me a river, cry me a river\nAnd I cried a river over you\nI cried a river over you\nI cried a river over you"
