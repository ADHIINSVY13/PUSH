  "lyrics": "[Spoken]\nDo you know me?\nReally know me?\nYou have opinions about my opinions\nAbout my music\nAbout my clothes\nAbout my body\nSome people hate what I wear\nSome people praise it\nSome people use it to shame others\nSome people use it to shame me\nBut I feel you watching\nAlways\nAnd nothing I do goes unseen\nSo while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief\nIf I lived by them, I'd never be able to move\nWould you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?\nWould you like me to be quiet?\nDo my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?\nAm I my stomach? My hips?\nThe body I was born with\nIs it not what you wanted?\nIf I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman\nIf I shed the layers, I'm a slut\nThough you've never seen my body, you still judge it\nAnd judge me for it\nWhy?\nWe make assumptions about people based on their size\nWe decide who they are\nWe decide what they're worth\nIf I wear more, if I wear less\nWho decides what that makes me? What that means?\nIs my value based only on your perception?\nOr is your opinion of me not my responsibility?"
