(Back to you, baby)\nI get drunk, pretend that I'm over it\nSelf-destruct, show up like an idiot\nWhy, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?\n[Post-Chorus]\nI go back to you, back to you, back to you (I go back to you)\nBack to you, back to you, back to you (Back to you)\nI go back to you, back to you, back to you every time (I go)\nI go back to you, back to you, back to you (You)\nBack to you, back to you, back to you\nI go back to you, back to you, back to you every time"
