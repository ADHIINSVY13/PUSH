  "lyrics": "A song off the Brianstrom EP dealing with trust in relationships.\n[Refrain: Alex Turner & Matt Helders]\nBetwixt and between, the fantastic dream and the fear\nDo you wonder where she is this afternoon?\n[Verse 1: Alex Turner & Matt Helders]\nAnd does it get on your nerves, make you slightly perturbed\nThat there's things that you don't know about her?\nAnd even the places that she's never been with you\nSeem awful empty without her\n[Chorus: Alex Turner]\nYou can't look into those eyes down no telephone line\nWhat if you were right first time?\nYou can't look into those eyes down no telephone line\nWhat if you were right first time?\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Refrain: Alex Turner & Matt Helders]\nBetwixt and between, the fantastic dream and the fear\nDo you wonder where she is this afternoon?\n[Verse 2: Alex Turner & Matt Helders]\nAnd with the needle in groove, is there owt to prove?\nAnd tell me, are your feet still tapping?\nI know thereâ€™s a first for a trip over the water\nWhat is the worst that could happen?\n\n[Chorus: Alex Turner]\nYou can't look into those eyes down no telephone line\nWhat if you were right first time?"
