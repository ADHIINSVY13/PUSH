  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNow I'm not afraid to do the Lord's work\nYou said vengeance is His, but I'ma do it first\nI'm gon' handle my business in the name of the law (ohh)\nNow if he made you cry, oh, I gotta know\nIf he's not ready to die, he best prepare for it\nMy judgement's divine, I'll tell you who you can call\nYou can call\n[Chorus 1]\nYou better call the police, call the coroner\nCall up your priest, have him warn ya\nWon't be no peace when I find that fool\nWho did that to you, yeah\nWho did that to you, my baby\nWho did that to you\nGotta find that fool who did that to you\n[Verse 2]\nNow I don't take pleasure in a man's pain\nBut my wrath will come down like the cold rain\nAnd there won't be no shelter, no place you can go\nIt's time to put your hands up, time for surrender\nI'm a vigilante, my love's defender\nYou're a wanted man, here everybody knows\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou better call the police, call the coroner\nCall up your priest, have him warn ya\nWon't be no peace when I find that fool\nWho did that to you, yeah\nWho did that to you, my baby\nWho did that to you\nGotta find that fool who did that to you\n[Bridge]\nNow he'll keep on running, but I'm closing in\nI hunt him down until the bitter end\nIf you see me coming man, who're you gonna call?\n[Chorus 2]\nYou better call the police, call the coroner\nCall up your priest, have him warn ya\nWon't be no peace when I find that fool\nYou better call the doctor, call the lawyer\nI chased him all away to California\nDid my best trying to find that fool\nWho did that to you"
