What's her name?\nYou don't need to know about everything\nWe fight about this, we fight about that\nYou hang up the phone and call me right back\nWell, I'll never be something I'm not\nPlease, don't throw away what we've got\n'Cause we've been together for way too long\nI was playing around, but I'm coming home\n\n[Chorus: John Legend, Candice, Tara & \nJohn Legend\n]\nYou know that I love you (\nKnow that I love you\n)\nThere's no one above you (\nNo one above you\n)\nI said it the last time (\nHey\n)\nBut this is the last time\nDon't make me over (\nDon't leave me, baby\n)\n'Cause I can be faithful (\nYou know I try\n)\nBaby, you're my number one (\nBaby\n)\nYou're my number one\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nI keep you laced up, so you ain't gotta borrow nothing\nFrom them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting\nThey say they shop on eBayâ€”baby, why is they frontin'?\nThey be on the internet, but they never cop nothin'\nI keep you in Girl what is those on your toes?\nAnd your neck staying froze off that rose-colored gold\nI suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'\nThinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis\nHe got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit\nAnd I don't wanna cheat, but I don't be saying shit\nI try to jack off he ask me who is you playin' wit'?\nBut I know he love you he told me you was his favorite\n[Chorus: John Legend, Candice, Tara, \nJohn Legend\n & \nKanye West\n]\nYou know that I love you (\nI know that I love you\n)\nThere's no one above you (\nThere's no one above you\n)\nI said it the last time (\nI said it the last time\n)\nBut this is the last time (\nHey, hey!\n \nI said it the last time\n)\nDon't make me over (\nDon't leave me, baby\n)\n'Cause I can be faithful (\nYou know I try\n)\nBaby, you're my number one (\nBaby!\n \nYou're my number one!\n)\nYou're my number one (\nYou're my number one! Let's go!\n)\n\n[Outro: John Legend, \nCandice & Tara\n]\nYou're making it hard for me, you're messing up everything\nYou tell me I gotta leave (Say we over)\nYou saw that she came over, came in the Range Rover\nLeft with a hangover (Say we over)\nI promise I won't cheat, I promise I won't lie\nI promise I'll act right (Say we over)\nYou can't tell me I can't have you\nI can't have that (\nWe ain't over\n)"
