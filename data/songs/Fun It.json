Now you're moving free\nGet some fun, join our dynasty\nCan't you tell? When we get it down\nYou're the one, you're the best in town\n[Chorus: Both]\nHey, everybody, everybody\nGonna have a good time tonight\nJust shaking the soles of your feet\nEverybody, everybody\nGonna have a good time tonight\nThat's the only soul you'll ever meet\n[Verse 3: Roger Taylor]\nThey say that moving\nThe body's jive it's all right\nThat's the only one part\nOf being alive, all right, all right\n\n[Verse 4: Freddie Mercury]\nGroove on out, groove on up, okay\nDo your thing, do your thing your way\nGet your kicks, get your tricks with me\nGet up and dance, honey, fun's for free\n[Chorus: Both]\nEverybody, everybody\nGonna have a good time tonight\nJust shaking the soles of your feet\nEverybody, everybody\nGonna have a good time tonight\nTime tonight, time tonight\nThat's the only soul you'll ever meet\n[Outro: Both]\nDon't shun it, fun it\nDon't shun it, fun it\nDon't shun it, fun it"
