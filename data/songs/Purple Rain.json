  "lyrics": "I never meant to cause you any sorrow\nI never meant to cause you any pain\nI only wanted one time to see you laughing\nI only want to see you laughing in the purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nI only want to see you bathing in the purple rain\nI never wanted to be your weekend lover\nI only wanted to be some kind of friend\nBaby, I could never steal you from another, oh no\nSuch a shame our friendship had to end\nPurple rain, purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nI only want to see you underneath the purple rain\nHoney, I know, I know times are wasted\nIt's time we all reach out for something new and that means you too\nYou say you want a leader but you can't seem to make up your mind\nI think you better close it, well, let me guide you to the purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain, purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nPurple rain, purple rain\nI only want to see you underneath the purple rain"
