  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can't conceive the nucleus of all\nBegins inside a tiny seed\nAnd what we see as insignificant\nProvides the purest air we breathe\n[Chorus]\nBut who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being\nFor these are but a few discoveries\nWe find inside the Secret Life of Plants\n[Verse 2]\nA species smaller than the eye can see\nOr larger than most living things\nAnd yet we take from it without consent\nOur shelter, food, habiliment\n[Chorus]\nBut who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being\nFor these are but a few discoveries\nWe find inside the Secret Life of Plants\n[Verse 3]\nBut far too many give them in return\nA stomp, cut, drown, or burn\nAs if they're nothing\nBut if you ask yourself where would you be\nWithout them you will find you would not\nAnd some believe antennas are their leaves\nThat spans beyond our galaxy\nThey've been, they are and probably will be\nWho are the mediocrity\n\n[Chorus]\nBut who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being\nFor these are but a few discoveries\nWe find inside the Secret Life of Plants"
