  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI resign myself to a strange sensation\nOf wanting somebody that I can't have\nI wish I could believe you relieve my tension\nBy telling me something I want to hear\nBut you won't\nWill you?\n[Chorus]\nSo I might be a little melancholy\nSo I might be a little melancholy\n[Verse 2]\nI resign myself to a day of frustration\nI can't help the feelings that I found\nYour sentimental touch fills my hear with elation\nAre we gonna kick this off the ground?\n[Chorus]\nSo I might be a little melancholy\nSo I might be a little melancholy\n[Reprise]\nI resign myself to a day of frustration\nI can't hide the feelings that I found\nAnd you aren't gonna help me, are you?\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I might be a little melancholy\nSo I might be a little melancholy\nSo I might be a little melancholy\nSo I might be a little melancholy\nSo I might be a little melancholy"
