  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAcross the sea, by the Tennessee skyline\nThey told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams\nBut I long to be in the bed of my true love\nBack where I came from, she's waiting for me\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll make my way\nThrough long winding country roads\nBut my heart still beats\nFor my home and my English rose\n[Verse 2]\nI told my dad on the phone it's amazing\nFrom the straight to the crazy, these places I've seen\nBut I long to be in the arms of my true love\nLike he loves my mother, he understands me\n[Chorus]\nI'll spend my days\nJust travelin' and playing shows\nBut my heart still beats\nFor my home and my English rose\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI met a man in a bar down in Memphis\nHe told me he went there to follow his dreams\nAnd he told me, \"Son, you know I lost my true love\nFor the same exact reason that you crossed the sea\"\n[Chorus]\nAnd I found truth\nIn people I barely know\nBut my heart still beats\nFor my home and my English rose\n[Outro]\nOh, my heart still beats\nFor my home and my English rose\nOh, my heart still beats\nFor my home and my English rose"
