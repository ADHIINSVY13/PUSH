Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me\nAre you still down? Raise 'em up\n\n[Outro]\nThat's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin' middle finger\nRaise 'em up\nThese hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?\nThug life niggas be the sickest\nYou feel me?\nNow get that shit written down\nGod damn!\nTook four years and a motherfuckin' case for these motherfuckers to feel me\nAin't that a bitch?\nAre you still motherfuckin' down?\nOld ho ass fake ass niggas\nWe out this motherfucker though"
