Material, women, and \nlarge paper\nThat means you inferior, not major\nNo idea's original, \nthere's nothing new under the sun\nIt's never what you do, but how it's done\nWhat you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper\nThat means you inferior, not major\n[Verse]\nIf niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find\nWhere bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes\nGo to the center, enter with caution, \npast the brain cell graveyard\nWhere weed's responsible for memory loss\nLet's witness the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous\nSee what I seen every day, I live with this torture\nLightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours\nSleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower\nMy tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons\nLong as I'm still breathin', I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em\nThe hood converted from trey bags to 20's of girl\nEverybody had money, every summer was real ill\nFour-finger rings, dope dealers, \n'caine/Kane\n\"No Half Steppin'\" with flat tops, when Rakim reigned\nRadios on card tables, \nBenetton\n, \nthe Gods buildin'\nAsk for today's Mathematics, we Allah's children\nAnd this was goin' on in every New York ghetto\nKids listened, \nFive Percenters\n said it's \npork in Jell-o\nWe coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference\nOn a different coast, but we share the same sunlight\nYour part of the world might be like colors and gangs\nWhile on my side, brothers'll murder for different things\nBut it all revolve around drugs, fame, and shorties\nStuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story\nFrom Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis\nThem treacherous rastas and the Mexican mafias\nBe scrappin' with tats on their back, violent wars\nNothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught\nCourtrooms, eagles and flags, American style\nWhile in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul\nWatchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in your child\nBut them gangstas put lead in your child\n, the bezzy be out\nThe chain be like a hundred K\nShinin' since \nRoxanne Shante' made \"Runaway\"\n – that's been a minute\nGenesis is deep, \nmy features are that of a God\nIt's not a facade, it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas\nMy \nExodus\n \ndoesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind\nEven with sleep, I'm duckin' nines in my dreams\nSi-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change?\nCan't hide when you famous, or even try to do the same things\nLike, somebody's always watchin'\nMy life before I walk out the door, I size up every option\nEyes cut every direction, it's like \nGod or guns\n –\nWhich is better protection?\nCan't decide, that's a hard one\nI mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled\nHeadline readin' \"Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'\""
