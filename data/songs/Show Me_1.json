  "lyrics": "This is the fourth track off of John Legend’s second album, Once Again. In this song he is talking to God in a very philosophical and inquisitive way. He’s searching for answers to age old questions.\nI realize as I lay down to sleep\nWe haven't spoken in weeks\nSo many things that I'd like to know\nCome have a talk with me\nI need a sign, something I can see\nWhy all the mystery?\nI try not to fall for make believe\nBut what is reality?\nWhere do we go?\nWhat do we know?\nLife has to have a meaning\nShow me the light\nShow me the way\nShow that you're listening\nShow me that you love me\nShow me that you walk with me\nHopefully, just above me\nHeaven's watching over me\nGuess it's funny how I say thanks to you\nFor all you've given me\nSometimes the price of what you gave to me\nI can't stop questioning\nO God of love, peace, and mercy\nWhy so much suffering?\nI pray for the world, it gets worse to me\nWonder if you're listening\nWhen people go\nWhy do they go?\nWhy don't you choose me?\nBut someday I know\nI'm gonna go\nI hope you're waiting for me\n\nShow me that you love me\nShow me that you walk with me\nHopefully, just above me\nHeaven's watching over me\nMaybe we'll talk\nSome other night\nRight now I'll take it easy\nWon't spend my time\nWaiting to die\nEnjoy the life I'm living\nShow me that you love me\nShow me that you walk with me\nHopefully, just above me\nHeaven's watching over me\nShow me that you love me\nShow me that you walk with me\nHopefully, just above me\nHeaven's watching over me, oh"
