  "lyrics": "'Twas on the Isle of Capri that I found her\nBeneath the shade of an old walnut tree\nOh, I can still see the flowers bloomin' 'round her\nWhere we met on the Isle of Capri\nShe was as sweet as a rose at the dawning\nBut somehow fate hadn't meant her for me\nAnd though I sailed with the tide in the morning\nStill my heart's on the Isle of Capri\nSummertime was nearly over\nBlue Italian sky above\nI said \"Lady, I'm a rover\nCan you spare a sweet word o'love?\"\nShe whispered softly \"It's best not to linger\"\nAnd then as I kissed her hand I could see\nShe wore a lovely meatball on her finger\n'Twas goodbye at the Villa Capri\nInstrumental-horns with mandolin\nSummertime was nearly over\nBlue Italian sky above\nI said \"Lady, I'm a rover\nCan you spare a fine word o'love?\"\n\nShe whispered softly \"It's best not to linger\"\nAnd then as I kissed her hand I could see\nShe wore a plain golden ring on her finger\n'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri\n'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri\n'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri"
