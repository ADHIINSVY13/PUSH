  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou booked the night train for a reason\nSo you could sit there in this hurt\nBustling crowds or silent sleepers\nYou're not sure which is worse\n[Chorus]\nBecause I dropped your hand while dancing\nLeft you out there standing\nCrestfallen on the landing\nChampagne problems\nYour mom's ring in your pocket\nMy picture in your wallet\nYour heart was glass, I dropped it\nChampagne problems\n[Verse 2]\nYou told your family for a reason\nYou couldn't keep it in\nYour sister splashed out on the bottle\nNow no one's celebrating\n[Chorus]\nDom Pérignon, you brought it\nNo crowd of friends applauded\nYour hometown skeptics called it\nChampagne problems\nYou had a speech, you're speechless\nLove slipped beyond your reaches\nAnd I couldn't give a reason\nChampagne problems\n\n[Bridge]\nYour Midas touch on the Chevy door\nNovember flush and your flannel cure\n\"This dorm was once a madhouse\"\nI made a joke, \"Well, it's made for me\"\nHow evergreen, our group of friends\nDon't think we'll say that word again\nAnd soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls\nThat we once walked through\nOne for the money, two for the show\nI never was ready so I watch you go\nSometimes you just don't know the answer\n'Til someone's on their knees and asks you\n\"She would've made such a lovely bride\nWhat a shame she's fucked in the head,\" they said\nBut you'll find the real thing instead\nShe'll patch up your tapestry that I shred\n[Chorus]\nAnd hold your hand while dancing\nNever leave you standing\nCrestfallen on the landing\nWith champagne problems\nYour mom's ring in your pocket\nHer picture in your wallet\nYou won't remember all my\nChampagne problems\n\n[Outro]\nYou won't remember all my\nChampagne problems"
