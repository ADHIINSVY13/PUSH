  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey say we bruise too easily\nI don't know if it's that way for me\nI've seen them come, I've seen them go\nI've seen everyone I know\nFall in and out of love\nIt's just the way it goes\nWord is out, silence seems so loud\nThere's no light above or below me now\nI've seen it grow, I've seen it live\nI've seen everything I give\nFalling out my hands, no matter who I'm with\n[Chorus]\nNobody ever tells you\nWhen love is dying, when love is dying\nIt just gets a little colder\nAnd we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a pain you never can explain\nIt cuts so deep time and time again\nI felt it then, I feel it now\nBut nobody told me how\nTo fight a world of hurt\nSomebody help me now\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody ever tells you\nWhen love is dying, when love is dying\nIt just gets a little colder\nAnd we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying\n[Verse 3]\nBut love never gets to show you\nAnd I never got to know you\nNo we never stood a chance\nWhen love was dying\nNo and love never makes it easy\nAnd I never got that feeling\nNo we never stood a chance\nWhen love was dying\n[Chorus]\nNobody ever tells you\nWhen love is dying, when love is dying\nIt just gets a little colder\nAnd we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying\n[Outro]\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying"
