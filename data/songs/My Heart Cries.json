  "lyrics": "I was lost in the world of dreams\nCounting every star\nShining overhead it seems\nI was like a shepherd boy\nSearching for his lamb\nHere and there and everywhere\nYou came, whoa yeah, you captured me\nYou and all your charms\nOh yes, you set me free\nWe kissed and the world was ours alone\nAnd my heart cried\nOh, I love you so\nThen my heart cried\nOh, I love you so\nThen my heart cried\nOh, I love you so\nLove you so\nLove you so"
