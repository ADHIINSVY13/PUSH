  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLeave the coffin open when I go\nLeave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows\nPretty will be the photograph I leave\nLaying down on famous knives, so everybody sees\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBleach out all the dark\nI'll swallow each peroxide shot\nSomeone I'll know could love and save me from myself\n[Refrain]\nMaybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes\nI'll be a \nPrincess Die\n and die with you\n[Chorus]\nI wish that I was strong\nI wish that I was wrong\nI wish that I could cope\nBut I took pills and left a note\n[Verse 2]\nI'm hungry from an anorexic heart\nI've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart\nI'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens\nI'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBleach out all the dark\nI'll swallow each peroxide shot\nVolumes I know will love and save me from myself\n[Refrain]\nMaybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes\nI'll be a \nPrincess Die\n and die with you\n[Bridge]\nPrincess die\nI want to see her cry\nPrincess die\nPrincess die\nWe want to watch her cry\nPrincess die\n[Chorus]\nI wish that I was strong\nI wish that I was wrong\nI wish that I could cope\nBut I took pills and left a note\n[Post-Chorus]\nI wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo\nRight after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold\nWith the paparazzi all swarming around\nIn my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down\nOh, it's not that deep\nSo bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven\nShe just wants to sleep\n\n[Outro]\nThe final act of life will be in my own hands to do\nI'll be a Princess Die and die with you\nApplaud, pour vous"
