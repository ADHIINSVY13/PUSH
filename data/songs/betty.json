Would you want me?\nWould you tell me to go fuck myself\nOr lead me to the garden?\nIn the garden, would you trust me\nIf I told you it was just a summer thing?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n[Verse 2]\nBetty, I know where it all went wrong\nYour favorite song was playing\nFrom the far side of the gym\nI was nowhere to be found\nI hate the crowds, you know that\nPlus, I saw you dance with him\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou heard the rumors from Inez\nYou can't believe a word she says\nMost times, but this time, it was true\nThe worst thing that I ever did\nWas what I did to you\n[Chorus]\nBut if I just showed up at your party\nWould you have me? Would you want me?\nWould you tell me to go fuck myself\nOr lead me to the garden?\nIn the garden, would you trust me\nIf I told you it was just a summer thing?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n[Bridge]\nI was walking home on broken cobblestones\nJust thinking of you when she pulled up like\nA figment of my worst intentions\nShe said, \"James, get in, let's drive\"\nThose days turned into nights\nSlept next to her, but\nI dreamt of you all summer long\n\n[Verse 3]\nBetty, I'm here on your doorstep\nAnd I planned it out for weeks now\nBut it's finally sinkin' in\nBetty, right now is the last time\nI can dream about what happens when\nYou see my face again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe only thing I wanna do\nIs make it up to you\nSo I showed up at your party\nYeah, I showed up at your party\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I showed up at your party\nWill you have me? Will you love me?\nWill you kiss me on the porch\nIn front of all your stupid friends?\nIf you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\nWill it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n[Outro]\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissin' in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight\nYou know I miss you"
