This means she she’s an expert at making him love her.\n[Verse 1]\nMy mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner\nMy eyes are the color of red like a sunset\nI'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner\nBe a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I see it in your movements tonight\nIf we should ever do this right\nI'm never gonna let you down\nNo, I'll never let you down\nNow, keep it on the down low\nAnd I'll keep you around, so I'll know\nThat I'll never let you down\nI'll never let you down\n[Chorus]\nYou're strummin' on my heart strings like you were a grade eight\nBut I've never felt this way\nI'll pick your feet up off of the ground\nAnd never ever let you down\nNow you're strummin' on my heart strings like you were a grade eight\nBut I've never felt this way\nI'll pick your feet up off of the ground\nAnd never ever let you down, down\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy eyes are a river filler, this drink is a liver killer\nMy chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again\nYour body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend\nYour eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow, I see it in your movements tonight\nIf we should ever do this right\nI'm never gonna let you down\nNo, I'll never let you down\nNow, keep it on the down low\nAnd I'll keep you around, so I'll know\nThat I'll never let you down\nI'll never let you down\n[Chorus]\nYou're strummin' on my heart strings like you were a grade eight\nBut I've never felt this way\nI'll pick your feet up off of the ground\nAnd never ever let you down\nYou're strummin' on my heart strings like you were a grade eight\nBut I've never felt this way\nI'll pick your feet up off of the ground\nAnd never ever let you down\n\n[Bridge]\nHold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now\nAnd I'll never let you down\nHold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now\nAnd I'll never let you down\nHold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now\nAnd I'll never let you down\nHold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now\nAnd I'll never let you down\n[Chorus]\nYou're strummin' on my heart strings like you were a grade eight\nBut I've never felt this way\nI'll pick your feet up off of the ground\nAnd never ever let you down\nYou're strummin' on my heart strings like you were a grade eight\nBut I've never felt this way\nI'll pick your feet up off of the ground\nAnd never ever let you down"
