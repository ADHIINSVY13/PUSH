  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nSame dances in the same old shoes\nSome habits that you just can't lose\nThere's no telling what a man might use\nAfter the thrill is gone\nThe flame rises but it soon descends\nEmpty pages and a frozen pen\nYou're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends\nAfter the thrill is gone, oh\nAfter the thrill is gone\nWhat can you do when your dreams come true\nAnd it's not quite like you planned?\nWhat have you done to be losing the one\nYou held it so tight in your hand well\nTime passes and you must move on\nHalf the distance takes you twice as long\nSo you keep on singing for the sake of the song\nAfter the thrill is gone\nAfter the thrill is gone\n[Bridge]\nYou're afraid you might fall out of fashion\nAnd you're feeling cold and small\nAny kind of love without passion\nThat ain't no kind of loving at all, well\n\n[Outro]\nSame dances in the same old shoes\nYou get too careful with the steps you choose\nYou don't care about winning but you don't want to lose\nAfter the thrill is gone\nAfter the thrill is gone\nAfter the thrill is gone, oh\nAfter the thrill is gone"
