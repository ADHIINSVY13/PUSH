Alright\nM.A\n[Verse 1: Young M.A]\nI like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble\nShake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh\nNigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it\nPro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing\nI hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience\nBut I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)\nAnd I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)\nYeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)\nMoney ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real (What is that?)\nIt's the broke lingo (Huh)\nAnd no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)\nMan, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)\nI just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)\nDo right and kill everybody, Drake mode (Hello)\nBitch, I'm tryna eat, I'll take your plate mode (Hello)\nDisrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)\nYou can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode\n (Huh)\nI'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh\nWhat up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)\nNeck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)\nEight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)\nCollect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)\nSelf-made goals (Hey)\nWhen the pain leaves (Huh)\nWhere does the pain go? (Where?)\nTip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)\nTo the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)\nSame pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)\nPinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose\nMe and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)\nCase closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nGame ov' (Over), Thanos on you H-Os\nOn my petty shit, but I don't paint toes (Yeah)\nGet the plunger (Plunger), 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy\nCall us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)\nBeat knocks like it leaked off Detox\nYou're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop\nPlease, dog, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it\nI am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage\nEach thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus\nStop it, cutting off your oxygen\nAnd I hit them pads like a boxing gym\nBetter watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again\nI won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop\nBut when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is\nI cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers\nI'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns\nAnd you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students\nShowed them all the blueprint and formula\nBut it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs\nI'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)\nBut I'm contemplating yelling \"Bombs away\" on the game\nLike I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nThey call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini\nWhere's Osama been? I been laden lately\nLook at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away\nThey wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nMan, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)\nI'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)\nThey call me Kanye crazy (Yah)\nApeshit, Beyoncé, JAY-Z (Woo)\nAnd I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)\nAnd the doctor's operating (What?)\nBut he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady\nShady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset\n'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet\nThat bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow\nLike a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo\nThose were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no\nI don't smoke, but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling in dough\nAnd I keep it one comma zero, zero, zero, zero\nReal, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill\nNickel-plated twenty-two, two, two\nBitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too\nAin't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views\nRun up in a church like pew, pew, pew\n'Cause that's what I do, do, do\nBut, even to the untrained human eye\nWe ain't the same, you and I\nSomebody should have explained to you why\nFor you to go against me is simply insane, you will die (Yeah)\nThat's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah\nBut I know magic and here go my last trick\nI'm 'bout to say \"Abracadabra\" and pull a B-Rabbit up out of my hat\nI'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react\nBut a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that\nAs I begin to fuckin' devour the track\nAnd you backpedal, that is a cowardly act\nLike a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nThey call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini\nWhere's Osama been? I been laden lately\nLook at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away\nThey wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"
