  "lyrics": "Lines on your face don't bother me\nDown in my chair when you dance over me\nI can't help myself\nI've got to see you again\nLate in the night when I'm all alone\nAnd I look at the clock and I know you're not home\nI can't help myself\nI've got to see you again\nI could almost go there\nJust to watch you be seen\nI could almost go there\nJust to live in a dream\nBut no I won't go for any of those things\nTo not touch your skin\n is not why I sing\nI can't help myself\nI've got to see you again\nI could almost go there\nJust to watch you be seen\nI could almost go there\nJust to live in a dream\nNo I won't go to share you with them\nBut oh even though I know where you've been\nI can't help myself\nI've got to see you again"
