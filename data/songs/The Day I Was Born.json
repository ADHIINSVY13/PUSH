I guess I'll never know\nI take the keys from my pocket and stumble into home\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I feel low, but I guess I could feel lower\nI'm headin' down and now I'm on a roll\n[Chorus]\nAnd everyone I know is hidden away\nTryin' to make their bodies clean again\nAnd they don't want to celebrate\nNobody cares this is the day I was born\nAlways the month when parties come to an end\nThe same excuses from every friend\nAnother year and now we're here again\nNobody cares this is the day I was born\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnother birthday alone\nLa-la-lay, la-la-lay\nAnother birthday alone\nLa-la-lay, la-la-lay\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI feel low, but I guess I could feel lower\nI'm headin' down and now I'm on a roll\n[Chorus]\nAnd everyone I know is hidden away\nTryin' to make their bodies clean again\nAnd they don't want to celebrate\nNobody cares this is the day I was born\nAlways the month when parties come to an end\nThe same excuses from every friend\nAnother year and now we're here again\nNobody cares this is the day I was born\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnother birthday alone\nLa-la-lay, la-la-lay\nAnother birthday alone\nLa-la-lay, la-la-lay"
