We grew on\nWe go back like futons and coupons\nWe too bad, we too wild, we too young\nShake some, my niggas gon' shake some\nFall through and break somethin'\nBroad day, and take somethin'\nBackwards, I've been livin' backwards\nOn my mattress, orgies on my mattress\nFlashes, dreamin', havin' flashes\nDashin', hopin' I don't crash it\n[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]\nMy Lambo gon' skrrt,\n \nmy crib ain't got service\nI got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous\nI got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool\nGotta watch the dukes, can't let them come through\nI got shit to lose\nHold up, wait, more to gain, more at stake\nI got shit to do\nHad to move, with the crew, away from you\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & \nCassie\n]\nSteady with the crew, steady with the crew\nSteady with the crew, steady with the crew\nAnd you never liked it, and you never liked them\nAnd I never liked it, and I never liked them\nSteady with the crew, steady with the crew\nSteady with the crew, steady with the crew\nAnd you never liked it, and you never liked them\nAnd I never liked it, and I never liked them"
