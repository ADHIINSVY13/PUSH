What did I do?\nI built you up, abandoned you\nAnd I'm too proud to say sorry\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFeel like I've done this before\nYou're fighting your tears as I open the door\nAnd you deserve much more\n[Chorus]\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love\nAnd I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough\nWatch you disappearin' down the road\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love the most\nOnes I love the most\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love the most\n[Bridge]\nI didn't mean it, baby\nI didn't think it all through\nI didn't mean it, baby\nAlways ruin good things like you\nI watched the life drain out of your eyes\nAnd it's no surprise\nIt's no surprise\n[Breakdown]\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love\nNow I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough\nI watch you disappearin' down the road\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love the most\n\n[Chorus]\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love\nAnd I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough\nWatch you disappearin' down the road\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love the most\nOnes I love the most\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love the most\n[Outro]\nOnes I love the most\nSeems like I always hurt the ones I love the most\nOnes I love the most"
