  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEvery time it rains\nIt rains pennies from heaven\nDon't you know each cloud contains\nPennies from heaven?\n[Verse 2]\nYou'll find your fortune's fallin'\nAll over the town\nBe sure that your umbrella\nIs upside down\n[Chorus]\nTrade them for a package of\nSunshine and flowers\nIf you want the things you love\nYou must have showers\n[Verse 3]\nSo, when you hear it thunder\nDon't run under a tree\nThere'll be pennies from heaven\nFor you and me\n[Chorus]\nTrade them for a package of\nSunshine and flowers\nIf you want the things you love\nYou must have showers\n\n[Chorus]\nSo when you hear it thunder\nDon't run under a tree\nThere'll be pennies from heaven\nFor you and me"
