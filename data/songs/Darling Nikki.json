  "lyrics": "I knew a girl named \nNikki\nI guess you could say she was a sex fiend\nI met her in a hotel lobby\nMasturbating with a magazine\nShe said how'd you like to waste some time\nAnd I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind\nShe took me to her castle\nAnd I just couldn't believe my eyes\nShe had so many \ndevices\nEverything that money could buy\nShe said \nsign your name on the dotted line\nThe lights went out\nAnd Nikki started to grind\nAaaahhhh! Nikki! Oh...\nThe castle started spinning\nOr maybe it was my brain\nI can't tell you what she did to me\nBut my body will never be the same\nHer lovin' will kick your behind\nOh, she'll show you no mercy\nBut she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind\nWoke up the next morning\nNikki wasn't there\nI looked all over and all I found\nWas a phone number on the stairs\nIt said thank you for a funky time\nCall me up whenever you want to grind\n\nAhhhh! Nikki! Oh...\nAhhhh! Come back, Nikki! Come back!"
