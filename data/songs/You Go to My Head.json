  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain\nAnd I find you spinning 'round in my brain\nLike the bubbles in a glass of champagne\nYou go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew\nAnd I find the very mention of you\nLike the kicker in a julep or two\n[Verse 2]\nThe thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea\nCast a spell over me\nStill, I say to myself, \"get a hold of yourself\nCan't you see that it never can be?\"\n[Verse 3]\nYou go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise\nLike a summer with a thousand Julys\nYou intoxicate my soul with your eyes\nThough I'm certain that this heart of mine\nHasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance\nYou go to my head\n[Outro]\nThough I'm certain that this heart of mine\nHasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance\nYou go to my head\nYou go to my head"
