Well, I want you to show me\nMy mama gone for the weekend\nSo Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.\"\nThat's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'\nBaby, you done woke my lil' man up\nI'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed\nTeacher, please, don't make me stand up\n, \nI wrote back like\n\"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.\"\nStill tryna play it cool, sound like the man\nBut I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'\nTalkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nI ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, you know that feelin' when you\nKnow you finna bone for the first time?\nI'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time\nI'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'\nAnd most of all I'm prayin', \"God, don't let me bust quick\"\nI'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right\nPractice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right\nI'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'\nWith a pocket full of rubbers and an erection\nThat's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'\nAnd a nigga roll over on top and then she\nGet my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'\nOn me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action\nPull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced\nBut right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said\n\"I wanna get somethin' off my mental\nI can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—\"\n[Chorus]\n‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nI ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\nAnd I ain't never did this before, no\n[Produced by J.
