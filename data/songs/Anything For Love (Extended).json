Mm\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe're all terrified of heartbreak\nRun at first signs of problems\nMake it look way too easy\nWe all got too many options\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love? (Anything for love)\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm not interested\nIn a love that gives up so easily\nI want a love that's set on keeping me\nWhen it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love?\n[Post-Chorus]\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love?\n[Verse 3]\nWe're all terrified of heartbreak\nRun at first signs of problems\nMake it look way too easy\nWe all got too many options\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love? (Anything for love)\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'm not interested\nIn a love that gives up so easily\nI want a love that's set on keeping me\nWhen it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love?\n[Post-Chorus]\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love?\n[Outro]\nI think that's the one, right?\nAll right, cool"
