  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe broke up a month ago\nYour friends are mine\nYou know I know you've moved on\nFound someone new\nOne more girl who brings out the better in you\n[Verse 2]\n(Car rides to Malibu)\n(Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two)\n(And tradin' jackets)\n(Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you)\n[Chorus]\nI hope you're happy (When she's with you)\nJust not like how you were with me (Do you get déjà vu?)\nThat was the show, we talked about\nPlayed you the song she's singing now\nWhen she's with you\nDo you get déjà vu?\n[Verse 3]\n(Watching reruns of Glee) Beautiful girl you've еver seen\n(Being annoying, singing in harmony) You know you'll nevеr mean\n(I bet she's bragging to all her friends saying you're so unique)\nShe probably gives you butterflies\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I hope you're happy (When she's with you)\nJust not like how you were with me (Do you get déjà vu?)\nI'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go\nSo find someone great but don't find no one better\nI hope you're happy but don't be happier"
