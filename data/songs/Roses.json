Remember when I was nine?\nTell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'\nHer family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'\nI'm arguin', like, \"What kind of doctor can we fly in?\"\nYou know the best medicine go to people that's paid\nIf Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS\nAnd all the broke motherfuckers passed away\nYou tellin' me if my grandma's in the NBA\nRight now, she'd be okay?\nBut since she was just a secretary\nWorking for the church for 35 years\nThings 'sposed to stop right here?\nMy grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong\nThat's where I get my confidence from\nI asked the nurse, \"Did you do the research?\"\nShe asked me, \"Can you sign some t-shirts?\"\n\"Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?\nYou don't see that we hurt?\" But still–\n\n[Hook: Bill Withers & \nTony Williams\n]\nI smile\nWhen roses come to see me\nAnd I can't wait for a sunny day (\nSeeing it through your eyes\n)\nCan't wait for the clouds to break\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nThey outside of the emergency room, room\nYou can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat\nIf she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon\nBut right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep\nMy momma say they say she could pass away any day\nHey, chick, what these doctors know anyway?\nLet me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt\nCousin Kim took off of work\nPlus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean\nSo many aunties we could have an Auntie Team\nFeel like Amerie, it's this \"1 Thing\"\nWhen they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam\nI think we at an all-time high\nTo get there, we run, we fly, we drive\n'Cause with my family, we know where home is\nSo instead of sending flowers, we the roses\n[Hook: Bill Withers & \nTony Williams\n]\nI smile\nWhen roses come to see me\nAnd I can't wait for a sunny day (\nSeeing it through your eyes\n)\nCan't wait for the clouds to break\n\n[Break: Bill Withers & \nPatti LaBelle\n]\n'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (\nOh\n)\n[Hook: Bill Withers, \nTony Williams\n, \nPatti LaBelle\n]\nI smile (\nOh-oh-ah\n)\nWhen roses come to see me\n (\nCome to-come away\n)\nAnd I can't wait for a sunny day (\nI can't wait to-ah\n, \nseeing it through your eyes\n)\nCan't wait for the clouds to break (\nYour eyes, for the clouds to break, oh\n)\n[Hook: \nBill Withers\n & \nPatti LaBelle\n]\nI smile\nWhen Rosie comes to see me\nAnd I'm sad when Rosie goes away\n'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (\nSay\n)\n[Outro: Patti LaBelle]\nCan't wait, I can't wait, no\nCan't wait, I can't wait, no\nCan't wait, I can't wait\nNo, can't wait for\nFor a sunny day\nSay \"Momma can't wait\nFor the clouds to break\"\nMm, mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm\nOh-oh-oh-oh, no, no, say (Woah, say)\nTellin' you the truth now\nSaid I can't wait, uh-uh\nI won't wait, oh no"
