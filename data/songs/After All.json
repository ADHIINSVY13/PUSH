  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPlease trip them gently, they don't like to fall\nOh by jingo\nThere's no room for anger, we're all very small\nOh by jingo\nWe're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts\nFrom the skies\n, from paradise\nBut they think that we're holding a secretive ball\nWon't someone invite them, they're just taller children\nThat's all\nAfter all\n[Verse 2]\nMan is an obstacle, sad as the clown\nOh by jingo\nSo hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down\nOh by jingo\nSome people are marching together and some on their own\nQuite alone\nOthers are running, the smaller ones crawl\nBut some sit in silence, they're just older children\nThat's all\nAfter all\n[Bridge]\nI sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords\nWith my words\nI've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called\nBut the thought just occurred\nWe're nobody's children\nAt all\nAfter all\n\n[Verse 3]\nLive till your rebirth and do what you will\nOh by jingo\nForget all I've said, please bear me no ill\nOh by jingo\n[Outro]\nAfter all, after all"
