Where will I wake up?\nHey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?\nWhere will I wake up? Where will I wake up?\n[Verse 2]\nHurry now, boy, time won't wait\nThe here and the now will separate\nThere are some things you cannot choose\nSoul and spirit movin' through\n[Chorus]\nHey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?\nWhere will I wake up? Where will I wake up?\nHey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?\nWhere will I wake up? Where will I wake up?\n\n[Interlude]\nWho's at the door now?\nWho's at the door now?\nWake up\nWho's at the door now?\nWake up\nWake up\nWake up\nWake up\nWake up\nWake up\nWake up\nWake up\n[Verse 3]\nTwo cold stones on a riverbed\nRipped and torn, cannot mend\nOld white candles on a dusty porch\nOne flame down, another born\n[Chorus]\nHey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?\nWhere will I wake up? Where will I wake up?\nHey kid, what's the plan for tomorrow?\nWhere will I wake up? Where will I wake up?\n\n[Part II]\n[Intro]\nWho's at the door now?\nWho's at the door now?\n[Verse 4]\nYou showed me how to breathe, never showed me how to say goodbye\nYou showed me how to be, never showed me how to say goodbye\nEvery page turns, it's a lesson learned in time\nYou showed me how to breathe, never showed me how to say goodbye\n[Chorus]\nTry and make good with the air that's left\nCountin' every minute, livin' breath by breath\nBy breath, by breath, by breath, by breath, by breath\nTry and make good with the air that's left\nCountin' every minute, livin' breath by breath\nBy breath, by breath, by breath, by breath\nBy breath, by breath, by breath\n[Verse 5]\nYou showed me how to need, never showed me how to say goodbye\nYou showed me how to grieve, never showed me how to say goodbye\nEvery page turns, it's a lesson learned in time\nYou showed me how to need, never showed me how to say goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nTry and make good with the air that's left\nCountin' every minute, livin' breath by breath\nBy breath, by breath, by breath, by breath, by\nTry and make good with the air that's left\nCountin' every minute, livin' breath by breath\nBy breath, by breath, by breath, by breath, by\n[Outro]\nGoodbye!\nGoodbye!\nGoodbye!\nGoodbye!"
