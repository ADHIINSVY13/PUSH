  "lyrics": "Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train\nI've run just as far as I can run\nIf I never see the good old days shinin' in the sun\nI'll be doin' fine and then some\nHow long, how long\nWoman will you weep\nHow long, how long\nRock yourself to sleep\nWell I been doin' time in lonesome prison, where the sun don't shine\nJust outside, the freedom river runs\nOut there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind\nDon't you know it's the same sad situation?\nHow long, how long\nWoman will you weep\nHow long, how long\nRock yourself to sleep\nEverybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody-eeee)\nEveryone is out there on the loose\nWell I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name\nBut what you get is not quite what you choose\nTell me, how long, how long\nWoman will you weep\nHow long, how long\nRock yourself to sleep\n\nHow long, how long (long and drawn out)\nMuddy River runs so deep\nHow long, how long (long and drawn out)\nGood night baby, rock yourself to sleep\nSleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep\nB-B-B Bye bye baby, Rock yourself to sleep"
