  "lyrics": "Grab your coat and get your hat, leave your worry at the doorstep\nJust direct your feet to the sunny side of the street\nCan't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune is your step\nLife can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street\nI used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade\nBut I'm not afraid 'cause this rover, crossed over\nIf I never had a cent I'll be as rich as Rockefeller\nGold dust at my feet on the sunny side of the street\nWith those blues on parade\nBecause this rover, it crossed over\nIf I never had a cent I'll be as loaded as old Rockefeller\nWith that gold dust 'round my feet\nOn the sunny side of the street\nOn the side, at that side of the street that is sunny"
