(Aren't I someone? Yeah)\nI'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)\n'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I know better\nThan to drive you home\n'Cause you'd invite me in\nAnd I'd be yours again\n[Chorus]\nBut I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)\nWith my future\nAnd you don't know her (Ooh)\nAnd I, I'm in love (Love, love)\nBut not with anybody here\nI'll see you in a couple years"
