  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I was six years old, I broke my leg\nI was runnin' from my brother and his friends\nAnd tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down\nI was younger then, take me back to when I\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFound my heart and broke it here\nMade friends and lost them through the years\nAnd I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown\nBut I can't wait to go home\n[Chorus]\nI'm on my way\nDrivin' at ninety down those country lanes\nSingin' to \"Tiny Dancer\"\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel and it's real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\n[Verse 2]\nFifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes\nRunnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends\nHad my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right\nBut I was younger then, take me back to when\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe found weekend jobs, when we got paid\nWe'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight\nMe and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown\nBut I can't wait to go home\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm on my way\nDrivin' at ninety down those country lanes\nSingin' to \"Tiny Dancer\"\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel and it's real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\n[Bridge]\nOne friend left to sell clothes\nOne works down by the coast\nOne had two kids but lives alone\nOne's brother overdosed\nOne's already on his second wife\nOne's just barely gettin' by\nBut these people raised me\nAnd I can't wait to go home\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'm on my way, I still remember\nThese old country lanes\nWhen we did not know the answers\nAnd I miss the way you make me feel and it's real\nWe watched the sunset over the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill\nOver the castle on the hill"
