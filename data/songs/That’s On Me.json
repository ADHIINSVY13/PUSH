Well, that's on me\n[Post-Chorus]\nWell, that's on me, well, that's on me\n[Verse 2]\nNow that the weather is colder\nNothin' is maskin' this pain\nThe summer was here, but won't stay\nAnd we are inside, like, all day\nRegrettin' the things that we say\nAnd it takes a toll, yeah\nThe conversation won't end\nBein' a rock for your friends\nCracks in the surface don't mend\nWe only break, we don't bend\nAnd you'd think it was so clear\nBut I can't see nothin' but the fear\nI'm feelin' so bloated\nThinkin' a salad won't do\nMight as well open up two\nLockin' myself in my room\nHopin' that this'll end soon\nAnd no one will notice\nWhat I will put myself through\n'Cause they will hate themselves too\nIsn't it mad what we do?\nPretendin' to win, but just lose\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd it's so far from near\nWhy the hell am I still here?\n[Chorus]\nThis is not the end of our lives\nThis is just a bump in the ride\nAnd I know that it will be alright\nAnd if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?\nI can't help myself but cry every time that I realise\nMaybe I'll never find my smile\nBut who's to blame? Well, that's on me\n[Post-Chorus]\nWell, that's on me, well, that's on me\n[Bridge]\nToo many things on my mind\nTo process moments of life\nThere's some days I lose my drive\nThen, some, can't control the fire\nI'm aware that things take time\nBut I'm not a patient guy\nMaybe, if I wait, I'll find\nResemblance of peace of mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis is just gettin' older\nRunnin' away from our past\nKnowin', the calm, it won't last\nBein' a mouse in this grass\nFeelin' the snakes behind us\nAnd I'm searchin' for closure\nBut nothin' is healin' these scars\nWhen I open up, they just laugh\nSayin' if they had just half\nThen nothin' would ever be dark\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs it, \"New me, new year\"\nOr just the same old blue sphere?\n[Chorus]\nThis is not the end of our lives\nThis is just a bump in the ride\nAnd I know that it will be alright\nAnd, if it's not, then we're fucked, aren't we?\nI can't help myself but cry every time that I realise\nMaybe I'll never find my smile\nBut who's to blame? Well, that's on me\n[Post-Chorus]\nWell, that's on me, well, that's on me\nWell, that's on me"
