  "lyrics": "I think of you with every breath I take\nAnd every breath becomes a sigh\nNot a sigh of despair\nBut a sign that I care for you\nI hear your name with every breath I take\nWith every breeze that wanders by\nAnd your name is a song\nI'll remember the long years through\nEven though I walk alone, you guide me\nIn the darkness, you light my way\nAnd all the while, inside me\nLove seems to say, \"Someday, someday.\"\nAnd when I sleep you keep my heart awake\nBut when I wake from dreams divine\nEvery breath that I take\nIs a prayer that I'll make you mine\nSomeday, someday\nAnd when I sleep you keep my heart awake\nAnd when I wake from dreams divine\nEvery breath that I take\nIs a prayer that I'll make you mine"
