  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nA perfect day, the sun is sinking low\nAs evening falls, the gentle breezes blow\nThe time we shared went by so fast\nJust like a dream, we knew it couldn't last\nBut I'd do it all again\nIf I could, somehow\nBut I must be leaving soon\nIt's your world now\n[Chorus]\nIt's your world now\nMy race is run\nI'm moving on\nLike the setting sun\nNo sad goodbyes\nNo tears allowed\nYou'll be alright\nIt's your world now\n[Verse 2]\nEven when we are apart\nYou'll always be in my heart\nWhen dark clouds appear in the sky\nRemember true love never dies\nBut first a kiss, one glass of wine\nJust one more dance while there's still time\nMy one last wish, someday, you'll see\nHow hard I tried and how much you meant to me\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's your world now\nUse well, the time\nBe part of something good\nLeave something good behind\nThe curtain falls\nI take my bow\nThat's how it's meant to be\n[Outro]\nIt's your world now[x3]"
