  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Pouya \nwith Rocci\n]\nWhy do I do the things I do to myself?\nThe pressure on my soul is damaging my health\nI know these rappers coming for my belt\nCutthroat 'cause you can't fit too much on that top shelf\nSo everybody wanna bump heads, money come rollin' in\nRelationships get questioned, do you even know your friends?\nBaby mama, hold my hand, tell me that it's gonna end\nLook up, tell me God is great, then, baby, why the sky so grey?\nLay my head in your lap as you caress my shoulder\nWe get high, then we doze off, wake me up when it's over (Yuh)\nI'm getting older, don't think I've come to terms yet\nStill searching for my purpose wondering if it's worth it\nYou study one book your entire life and still end up a crook\nI'm rollin' dice, I come alive at night, I never thought to\nLook the other way as my demons call my name\nYou know what they say, who am I to blame?\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 2: Pouya]\nThey say to think, sleep and breathe deeper\nIs the only way to avoid meetin' the Grim Reaper\nPrayin' on my knees until I crease my sneakers\nCan anybody out there hear me? Should I speak up?\nI'm pacing back and forth like it's a sport with sweat dripping down my face\nThe weight of the world is on my chest and I just wanna walk away\nI've been betrayed, swayed, and played, face-to-face\nBy the ones who say they love me the most\nBut now I know that blood was never thick as water\nSee my friends die slowly in front of my eyes\nSee the pain and agony through every smile that I encounter\nBack of the tour bus with the blue pills, dollar bills, and dancers\nBack at home, second hand, strugglin' with cancer\nAlmost felt like it was me, how could I be so selfish?\nThinking about myself but not the one that I'm in love with\nDamn, my heart feel like erupting\nBarely shedding tears, I had to emphasize my toughness"
