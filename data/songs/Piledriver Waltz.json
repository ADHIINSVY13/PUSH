  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop\nAnd did a swap for the sand in an hourglass\nI heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving\nI heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning\n[Chorus]\nYou look like you've been for breakfast\nAt the heartbreak hotel\nAnd sat in the back booth by the pamphlets\nAnd the literature on \nhow to lose\nYour waitress was miserable\nAnd so was your food\nIf you're gonna try and walk on water\nMake sure you wear your comfortable shoes\n[Verse 2]\nMysteries flashing amber go green when you answer\nBut the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes\nI heard the news that you're planning to shoot me out of a cannon\nI heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning\n[Chorus]\nYou look like you've been for breakfast\nAt the heartbreak hotel\nAnd sat in the back booth by the pamphlets\nAnd the literature on \nhow to lose\nYour waitress was miserable\nAnd so was your food\nIf you're gonna try and walk on water\nMake sure you wear your comfortable shoes\n\n[Outro]\nOh-oh, oh-oh\nPiledriver"
