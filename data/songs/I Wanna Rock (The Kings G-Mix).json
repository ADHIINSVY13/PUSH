Rich as fuck, boy!\nBlack and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy\nI'm on my Eastside, shit I'm working\nI got the party going, and it's jerking\nMy niggas all long, we rolling out deck\nHoes getting in, you better pick a bitch\nCause when I shut it down, the party's over with\nShe call me \"Superman\", I'm on my \"Soulja\" shit\nBoss Dogg get em, I sick em and take em home\nWest Coast bitch, I'm on my fucking throne\nI'm gigging on these hoes, do em like dominoes\nAnd slam em on they back and tell em \"vamanos\""
