  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLiving in lies by the railway line\nPushing the hair from my eyes\nElvis is English and climbs the hills\nCan't tell the bullshit from the lies\nScreaming\n along in \nSouth London\nVicious but ready to learn\nSometimes I fear that the whole world is queer\nSometimes but always in vain\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll wait until we're sane\nWait until we're blessed and all the same\nFull of blood, loving life and all it's got to give\nEnglishmen going insane\n[Refrain]\nDown on my knees in Suburbia\nDown on myself in every way\n[Verse 2]\nWith \ngreat expectations\n \nI change all my clothes\nMustn't grumble\n at \nsilver and gold\nScreaming above Central London\nNever bored, so I'll never get old\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I'll wait until we're sane\nWait until we're blessed and all the same\nFull of blood, loving life and all it's got to give\nEnglishmen going insane\n[Refrain]\nDown on my knees in suburbia\nDown on myself in every way\n[Outro]\nDay after, day after day, day after\nZane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien\nDay after day, day after\nZane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien\nDay after"
