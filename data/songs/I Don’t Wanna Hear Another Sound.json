  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy balance was gone, but so is the pain\nWas waitin' around, but you never came\nSo I ran into Tony, he grabbed on my body\nI told him \"I missed you\", he told me he loved me\nAnd hey, I liked the way he said my name\nThat's all he had to say\n[Verse 2]\nThe damage is done, but so is the wait\nAnd I tried not to run 'cause it would be a mistake\nBut it would be a mistake if I just took my time\n'Cause I'd be waitin' around just to pay for your crimes\nAnd hey, I know what it takes to be wrong\nBut it feels all right to me\n[Chorus 1]\nEven though I know you let me down\nI don't know why I can't come around\nAnd even though I know my mind is sound\nCouldn't walk away from what I found, oh-oh\n[Verse 3]\nYour honesty's good but too much is bad\nAnd I've been trying to hold on to something I never had\n'Cause I never had you just as I have you now\nThat you're afraid of losin' but you're not scared enough\nHey wait, you wipe that smile right off of your face\n'Cause I don't know where it came from\n\n[Chorus 2]\nEven if I know I won't be found\nI will still be hiding underground\nEven if I go outside I find\nYou've already left me far behind\nOh, even when this song comes crashing down\nI don't wanna hear another sound\nNo, I don't wanna hear another sound, oh-oh"
