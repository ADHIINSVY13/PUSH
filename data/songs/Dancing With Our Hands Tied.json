And\nMy, my love had been frozen\nDeep blue, but you painted me golden\nOh, and you held me close\nOh, how was I to know? I\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets\nPicture of your face in an invisible locket\nYou said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it\nI had a bad feelin'\nAnd darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis\nPeople started talkin', puttin' us through our paces\nI knew there was no one in the world who could take it\nI had a bad feelin'\n[Chorus]\nBut we were dancin'\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin'\nLike it was the first time, first time\nYeah, we were dancin'\nDancin' with our hands tied, hands tied\nYeah, we were dancin'\nAnd I had a bad feelin'\nBut we were dancin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nI, I loved you in spite of\nDeep fears that the world would divide us\nSo, baby, can we dance\nOh, through an avalanche?
