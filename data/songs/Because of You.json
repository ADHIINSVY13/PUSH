It is speculated to be an outtake from the Paradise sessions.\n[Spoken Intro]\nOn the streets of LA\nWhere the future is now\nWe dance like nobody is watching us\nAnd we live like we want to\nBut it can also get a little crazy\nUnless there's something to hold on to\nFor me, that was true love\n[Verse 1]\nI was a young girl, selfish and wild\nLike a fire in L.A\nHot like the summer and mean like a child\nWho keeps crying 'til she gets her way\n(Like a true star)\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nThere were roses in my hair\nRock and roll on blare and I was in trouble\nNo one could rock me like you could\nI was a bad girl gone good\n[Chorus]\nLook at me now, I have everything\nYou gave to me and my heart can sing\nI was a kid who could only drink\nDance on tables, making deals with devils\nLike a drunk beauty queen\nFighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene\nAnd it brought me to my knees\nAnd it's all because of you\n(You know what I'm talkin' about)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was a mad world, we lived for fun\nAnd we got shit for free\nHad a face like an angel but inside my heart\nWas as black as a broke movie screen\n(It was pretty sad)\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBut then I saw you standing there\nLike a millionaire, give me your number\nCall me before I get stupid\nMake me uncrazy like you did\n[Chorus]\nLook at me now, I have everything\nYou gave to me and my heart can sing\nI was a kid who could only drink\nDance on tables, making deals with devils\nLike a drunk beauty queen\nFighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene\nBut you brought me to my knees\nAnd it's all because of you\n[Bridge]\nIt isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me\nGive me your money, love me to death\nTalk like a baby cause I'm so elated\nHe tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet\nI don't wanna lose it\nI'm in love but I didn't choose it\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nRoses in my hair, dancing in the air\nFeels like I'm flying\nTell me you love me, boy, do it\nIt's just like I thought, I just knew it\n[Chorus]\nLook at me now, I have everything\nYou gave to me and my heart can sing\nI was a kid who could only drink\nDance on tables, making deals with devils\nLike a drunk beauty queen\nFighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene\nYou bring me to my knees\nAnd it's all because of you\nYeah, it's all because of you"
