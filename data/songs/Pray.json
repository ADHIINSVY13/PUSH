Sweet taste of sin\nEverything I seen made me everything I am\nBad drug dealer or victim, I beg\nWhat came first? Moving chickens or the egg?\nThis is why I be so fresh\nI'm tryna beat life, 'cause I can't cheat death\nTreat shame with shamelessness\nAim stainlesses at anuses\nYou know the game this is?\nMove coke like Pepsi,\n \ndon't matter what the brand name is\nI stand behind mine\nEverything I do, I'm a man behind mine\nI'm not an angel, I'm sure\nBut every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor\nAnd I pray\n\n[Outro: Beyoncé]\nThe name shall endure forever\nThe name shall be continued as long as the sun\nPray for me!\nMen shall be blessed in Him\nAll nations shall call Him blessed\nIn Your name, I pray\nPray for me!\nLord bless us"
