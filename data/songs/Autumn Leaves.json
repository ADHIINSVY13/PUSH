  "lyrics": "Ed Sheeran wrote this song about a dear friend that had passed away, and it is a bonus song on his debut album +.\n[Verse 1]\nAnother day, another life\nPasses by, just like mine\nIt's not complicated (Oh)\nAnother mind, another soul\nAnother body to grow old\nIt's not complicated\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?\n[Chorus]\nFloat down like autumn leaves\nHush now, close your eyes before the sleep\nAnd you're miles away\nAnd yesterday, you were here with me\n[Verse 2]\nOh, another tear, another cry\nAnother place for us to die\nIt's not complicated\nAnother life that's gone to waste\nAnother light lost from your face\nIt's complicated\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIs it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?\n\n[Chorus]\nFloat down like autumn leaves\nAnd hush now, close your eyes before the sleep\nAnd you're miles away\nAnd yesterday, you were here with me\n[Bridge]\nOoh, how I miss you\nMy symphony played the song that carried you out\nAnd, ooh how I miss you\nAnd I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?\n[Chorus]\nFloat down like autumn leaves\nHush now, close your eyes before the sleep\nAnd you're miles away\nAnd yesterday, you were here with me\n[Outro]\nMmm, mmm, mmm, mmm\nTouch down like a seven-four-seven\nWe'll stay out and we'll live forever now"
