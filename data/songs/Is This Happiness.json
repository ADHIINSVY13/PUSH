Thompson\nI think you're fucking crazy as the day's long\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMan to man, heart to heart\nI love you but you drive me so far\nWish you well on that star\nHm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this happiness?\nIs this happiness?\nIs this happiness?\nIs this happiness?\n[Bridge]\nWitch Hazel, Witch Hazel\nBetrayal, betrayal\nOne gun on the table\nHeadshot if you're able\n[Chorus]\nIs this happiness?\nIs this happiness?\nIs this happiness?\nIs this happiness?\n[Outro]\nHm-hm-hm-hm\nHm-hm-hm-hm\nHm-hm-hm-hm\nHm-hm-hm-hm"
