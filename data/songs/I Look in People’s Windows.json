  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI had died the tiniest death\nI spied the catch in your breath\nOut, out, out, out, out, out\nNorthbound I got carried away\nAs you boarded your train\nSouth, south, south, south, south, south\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA feather taken by the wind blowing\nI'm afflicted by the not knowing, so\n[Chorus]\nI look in people's windows\nTransfixed by rose golden glows\nThey have their friends over to drink nice wine\nI look in people's windows\nIn case you're at their table\nWhat if your eyes looked up and met mine\nOne more time?\n[Verse 2]\nYou had stopped and tiltеd your head\nI still ponder what it meant\nNow, now, now, now, now, now\nI triеd searching faces on streets\nWhat are the chances you'd be\nDowntown, downtown, downtown\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoes it feel alright to not know me?\nI'm addicted to the \"if only\"\n[Chorus]\nSo I look in people's windows\nLike I'm some deranged weirdo\nI attend Christmas parties from outside\nI look in people's windows\nIn case you're at their table\nWhat if your eyes looked up and met mine\nOne more time?"
