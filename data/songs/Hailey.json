(Do right)\nTo hold you every night (Every night)\nIt's beyond an obsession, all of my attention\nNothing can compare to you\n\n[Chorus]\nThis life is crazy\nBut it led me to your love\nIf you call on me forever I will come\nNo matter what, baby\nThe only thing I'm certain of\nWe'll be diamond when the golden days are done (Yeah, ayy)\n[Outro]\nThis life is crazy\nBut it led me to your love\nIf you call on me forever I will come\nNo matter what, baby\nThe only thing I'm certain of\nWe'll be diamond when the golden days are done\nNo matter what, no matter what (Yeah, yeah)\nIt's only us (It's only us)\nYeah, no matter what"
