(\nUgh\n)\nCouldn't let you sit there\nYou need help, somebody should get there\nYou see, girl, time is like money\nBoth of which men love\nSpend them both with me\nAnd then for sure, you'll know\n\n[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nBaby, I come running\nBaby, I come running\nJust keep me coming\nAnd I come running\nCause I'm your dog\nBaby I'm your dog\nSo whenever you call\nI come running\nBaby, I come running\nBaby, I come running\nJust keep me coming\nAnd I come running\nCause I'm your dog\nBaby I'm your dog\nSo whenever you call\nI come running\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nUh\nShe's impressed by a fat boy\nCadillac, weed, pistol on his lap, boy\nHome run hitter, thought I was a batboy\nSearch warrant for the crib, you better get a map for it\nPaid for, meanin' I ain't gotta rap for it\nShe a alley oop, I tap it off the backboard\nHustlin', baby what you lookin' for? Just ask for it\nBlue Ferrari, I'm the envy of the task force\nImpeccable suits, as I run with my dogs\nPinkie rings and things that come with my wonderful job\nDogg pound niggas, and we came to fight\nI was several million up before it came to light\nNow they callin' me the truest one to ever do it\nStatus symbol for the pimps, now enjoy the music\nSmoked out like a player and you know the name\nBreak a bitch quick, really, biggest in the game\nMaybach Music\n\n[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nBaby, I come running\nBaby, I come running\nJust keep me coming\nAnd I come running\nCause I'm your dog\nBaby I'm your dog\nSo whenever you call\nI come running\nBaby, I come running\nBaby, I come running\nJust keep me coming\nAnd I come running\nCause I'm your dog\nBaby I'm your dog\nSo whenever you call\nI come running\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nI got... Rottweiler in tube sock\nPitbull... lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die\nBoxer... you take mine's off then hallelujah\nShando, count my blessings\n, spin around two times\nFreaky... freak like it's the 80s\nFuckin' explicit, radio prolly say we\nShould tone it... down with the clean version\nDirty... but in public you're like teen virgin\nI like it... make me realize my vices\nEnticin', flower bombin' all on your privates\nPrivate... meetin' inside your bedroom\nHead in that Maybach boomin', thank God for leg room\nIt's a trophy in that pussy, I'mma cum in first place\nI'mma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place\nI'm your D-O-double-G and I need more Pedigree\nWhat it D-O? Puppy chow, I've been grown and so off the leash, ho\n\n[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nBaby, I come running\nBaby, I come running\nJust keep me coming\nAnd I come running\nCause I'm your dog\nBaby I'm your dog\nSo whenever you call\nI come running\nBaby, I come running\nBaby, I come running\nJust keep me coming\nAnd I come running\nCause I'm your dog\nBaby I'm your dog\nSo whenever you call\nI come running"
