  "lyrics": "Dear, this evening seemed to go so awfully fast\nWe had so much fun and now you're home at last\nI look forward to a kiss or two at the garden gate\nBut she gave me just a peck and insisted it was late\nGive me five minutes more, only five minutes more\nLet me stay, let me stay in your arms\nHere am I, begging for only five minutes more\nOnly five minutes more of your charms\nAll week long I dreamed about our Saturday date\nDon't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?\nGive me five minutes more, only five minutes more\nLet me stay, let me stay in your arms\nAll week long I dreamed about our Saturday date\nDon't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?\nGive me five minutes more, only five minutes more\nLet me stay, let me stay in your arms\nAh, come on"
