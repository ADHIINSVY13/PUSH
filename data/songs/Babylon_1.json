(Ah)\nOh, now it's on from here on out\nPut yo' hands in the atmosphere, if you know what I'm talkin' about\nNow if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song\nThey call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong\n\n[Hook: Andrea Martin]\nOoh, I fear the battle's just begun (Oh)\nOoh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nSo I'm hopin', wishin', prayin' (Prayin')\nTo keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)\nIn you (Oh, ooh)\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nPeople don't know the stress I'm dealin' with, day to day (Day)\nSpeakin' about the feelings I'm possessin' for Rene\nMopin' around and wonderin' where she stay, saw her last that she lay\n\"Give it another day,\" I say, but the Lord, he taketh away\nNow give it back, Lord,\n \n'cause that's like backboards without the rims\nMe and my auntie was tight like Southwest\nBefore the pinks moved in\nLike the niggas who owned the liquor stores\nCrack cocaine, pimps, and whores\nLivin' up on this Earth before a nigga like Daddy was born\nBut they be makin' it seem that my music and crime are team\nBut I'm speakin' the truth not dreams (Dream)\nSo what in the \nfuck\n they mean? My lyrics stay clean\n[Hook: Andrea Martin, & \nBig Boi\n]\nOoh (\nYeah\n), I fear the battle's just begun\nOoh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (So I keep hopin')\nSo I'm hopin', (And) wishin', (And) prayin' (Prayin')\nTo keep my faith in you (My faith in you)\nIn you\n\nOoh, I fear the battle's just begun (Just begun, oh-woah)\nOoh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (Oh, yeah)\nSo I'm hopin', wishin', prayin' (Ooh)\nTo keep my faith in you (My faith in you)\nIn you\nOoh, I fear the battle's just begun (Yeah, yeah)\nOoh, though we're here, someday, we will be gone (I keep hopin')\nSo I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'\nTo keep my faith in you\n[Outro: Andrea Martin]\nMy faith in you\nMy faith in you\nMy faith in you (Keep my faith)\nMy faith in you\nMy faith in you\nMy faith in you\nMy faith..."
