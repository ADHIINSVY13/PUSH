  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe got thrown in a riot van\nAnd the coppers kicked him in\nAnd there was no way he could win\nJust had to take it on the chin\n[Verse 2]\nSmoked a bong a last night\nAnd stole somebody's telephone\nHe thinks it's all alright\nBut they've left him on his own, on his own\n[Chorus]\nBut baby stop calling\nOver and over, yeah\nAnd give me some funny cigarettes\nAnd do what they told you, yeah\n[Verse 3]\nPinched a car with one headlight\nAnd lost control, the passengers were screaming\nMade him shut his eyes right tight\nAnd think of you, and hope that he was dreaming\n[Verse 4]\nThen up rolled the riot van\nAnd called the fire brigade\nBut it was already too late\nAnd there was no arrests to make\nOhhhhh!\n\n[Chorus]\nBut baby stop calling\nOver and over yeah\nAnd give me some funny cigarettes\nAnd do what they told you, yeah"
