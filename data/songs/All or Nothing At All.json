  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAll or nothing at all\nHalf a love never appealed to me\nIf your heart never could yield to me\nThen I'd rather have nothing at all\n[Verse 2]\nAll or nothing at all\nIf it's love, there is no in between\nWhy begin and cry for something that might have been\nNo, I'd rather have nothing at all\n[Verse 3]\nBut please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek\nDon't you smile or I'll be lost beyond recall\nThe kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak\nAnd my heart may go dizzy and fall\n[Verse 4]\nAnd if I fell under the spell of your call\nI would be caught in the undertow\nAnd so you see, I've got to say no, no\nAll or nothing at all"
