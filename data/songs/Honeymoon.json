  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe both know\nThat it's not fashionable to love me\nBut you don't go\n'Cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me\nWe could cruise to the blues\nWilshire Boulevard, if we choose\nOr whatever you wanna do\nWe make the rules\n[Chorus]\nOur honeymoon\nOur honeymoon\nOur honeymoon\nSay you want me, too\nSay you want me, too\nDark blue\nDark blue\n[Verse 2]\nWe both know\nThe history of violence that surrounds you\nBut I'm not scared\nThere's nothing to lose now that I've found you\nAnd we could cruise to the news\nPico Boulevard in your used\nLittle bullet car, if we choose\nMr. Born-to-Lose\n\n[Chorus]\nOur honeymoon\nOur honeymoon\nOur honeymoon\nSay you want me, too\nSay you want me, too\nDark blue\nDark blue\n[Bridge]\nThere are violets in your eyes\nThere are guns that blaze around you\nThere are roses in between my thighs\nFire that surrounds you\nIt's no wonder every man in town\nHad neither fought nor found you\nEverything you do is elusive, too\nEven your honey dew\n[Chorus]\nOur honeymoon\nOur honeymoon\nOur honeymoon\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do, da-da-da\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do, da-da-da\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do, da-da-da-da-da\n\n[Outro]\nDreaming away your life\nDreaming away your life\nDreaming away your life, mmm\nDreaming away your life\nDreaming away your life\nDreaming away your life, mmm"
