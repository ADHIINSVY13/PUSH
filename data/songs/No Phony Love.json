(Nah)\nI just want somebody who real\nLate-night, play D'Angelo, \nHow Does It Feel\n (Facts)\nYou lookin’ for security I want someone secure\nLet’s drop thirty at Louis and have sex in the store\nBehind the curtain in the dressing room, you ain’t about that life, haha\nI be excited to see you like I just didn’t leave you (Word)\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Charlie Wilson, \nCharlie Wilson\n & \nNas\n]\nNo phony love, if only love\nGuaranteed trust, just to sum it up\nYou know what’s up (\nKnow what's up\n) It's only us (\nOoh-wee\n)\nIt’s only us (\nOoh\n) it’s only us\nNo phony love\n (\nNo phony love\n) \nIf only love\n (\nIf only love\n)\nGuaranteed trust\n (\nGuaranteed trust\n) \nJust to sum it up\nYou know what’s up (\nLove\n) \nit’s only us\nIt’s only us, it’s only us\n[Outro: Nas]\nYou know us Virgos\nAll picky, in our heads and stuff\nLove is trust\nTrust is love, trust is love\nLove is trust"
