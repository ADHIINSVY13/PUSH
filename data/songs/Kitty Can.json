  "lyrics": "Eve never pleases me and kitty can\nEve never pleases me and kitty can\nWhen kitty smiles, the world stands still\nI see a thousand golden daffodils\nBut when she cries, the world just dies\nI see a million tears in kitty's eyes\nEve never pleases me and kitty can\nEve never pleases me and kitty can\nNow Eve is bad and treats me cruel\nShe loves to see me looking like a fool\nI find a way with words I say\nTo be in love in such a lonely way\nEve never pleases me and kitty can\nEve never pleases me and kitty can\nNow they are two and I am one\nI cannot fall in love with everyone\nSo I must choose between the two\nMade up my mind, now I am choosing you\nEve never pleases me and kitty can\nEve never pleases me and kitty can"
