  "lyrics": "The B-side to the single “Don’t Sit Down Cause I Moved Your Chair.”\n[Verse 1]\nBlack as a beacon in a river of shimmering fog\nYes, she was\nIf you were heatseeking, she was hard to ignore\nYes, she was\n[Chorus]\nAnd she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs\nThe particular pretty ones\nAnd that meant she never had to strain her back\nWhen she was putting her lippy on\n[Verse 2]\nWell, time tastes bland\nWhen she's not around\nAnd you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink\nBefore she showed you how to shake love's steady hand\nTha knows\n[Chorus]\nAnd she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs\nThe particular pretty ones\nAnd that meant she never had to strain her back\nWhen she was putting her lippy on\n[Bridge]\nShake love's steady hand\nShake love's steady\nShe floats like a niccy rush and stings like a B-flat\nThe blond-o-sonic shimmer trap\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs\nThe particular pretty ones\nAnd that meant she never had to strain her back\nWhen she was putting her lippy on"
