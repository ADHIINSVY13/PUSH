  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWith the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face\nTo heaven you rise in a holy embrace\nYour feet on the round your head in the clouds\nAnd you are wondering if you are never coming down\nIn an instant the mysteries of life will unfold\nThe myths and the dragons of time will explode\nHere is to a real understanding of truth\nFor compassion and grace to be given their chance too\n[Chorus]\nRaise up your mind\nIt is time to shine\n[Verse 2]\nA moment down through millennium\nUnveiling the secrets of song to be sung\nWaters of life flowing soft to the touch\nWisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much\n[Chorus]\nRaise up your mind\nIt is time to shine\nRaise up your mind\nHey, it is time to shine\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet us awaken from barbarity\nInto a world of serenity\nBeyond the rage of foolish pride\nAnd on to the golden shores of paradise\n[Outro]\nRaise up your mind\nHey, it is time to shine\nRaise up your mind\nHey, it is time to shine\nRaise up your mind\nYour time to shine\nIt is time to shine[x2]"
