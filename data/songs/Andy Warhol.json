Andy Warho-\nAndy War-War-ol, like hol—hol—\n\"Andy War-hole,\" take one\nHa\nAre you ready?\nYeah, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha\n[Verse 1]\nLike to take a cement fix\nBe a standing cinema\nDress my friends up just for show\nSee them as they really are\nPut a peephole in my brain\nTwo New Pence to have a go\nI'd like to be a gallery\nPut you all inside my show\n[Chorus]\nAndy Warhol looks a scream\nHang him on my wall\nAndy Warhol, Silver Screen\nCan't tell them apart at all\n\n[Verse 2]\nAndy walking, Andy tired\nAndy take a little snooze\nTie him up when he's fast asleep\nSend him on a pleasant cruise\nWhen he wakes up on the sea\nBe sure to think of me and you\nHe'll think about paint and he'll think about glue\nWhat a jolly boring thing to do\n[Chorus]\nAndy Warhol looks a scream\nHang him on my wall\nAndy Warhol, Silver Screen\nCan't tell them apart at all\n[Chorus]\nAndy Warhol looks a scream\nHang him on my wall\nAndy Warhol, Silver Screen\nCan't tell them apart at all"
