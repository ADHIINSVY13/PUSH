The city is mine\n[Chorus: Blackstreet & (\nJay-Z\n)]\nYou belong to the city (\nuh-huh, yeah, the city is mine\n)\nYou belong to the night (\nah ah, the city is mine\n)\nIn the river of darkness (\nfeel me, the city is mine\n)\nHe's the man of the night (\nthe city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine\n)\nYou belong to the city\nYou belong to the night\nIn the river of darkness\nHe's the man of the night\n\n[Outro: Blackstreet]\nYou belong\nYou belong\nIn the river of darkness\nHe's the man of the night"
