  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYour toy balloon has sailed in the sky now\nBut now it must fall to the ground\nNow. your sad eyes reveal\nJust how badly you feel\nThere is no easy way down\n[Verse 2]\nThe view from the cliffs must have been exciting\nAnd up to the peaks you were bound\nNow, you're stranded alone\nAnd the past is unknown\nAnd there is no easy way down\n[Bridge]\nNo, it isn't very easy\nWhen you find yourself out on your own\nNo, it isn't very easy\nWhen each road you take\nIs one more mistake\nNo one to break your fall\nAnd lead you back home\n[Verse 3]\nWe all like to climb to the heights of love, dear\nWhere our fantasy world can be found\nBut you must know in the end\nWhen it's time to descend\nThat there is no easy way down\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Bridge]\nNo, it isn't very easy\nWhen you find yourself out on your own\nNo, it isn't very easy\nWhen each road you take\nIs one more mistake\nAnd no one will break your fall\nAnd lead you back home\n[Verse 3]\nWe all like to climb to the heights of love, dear\nWhere our fantasy world can be found\nBut you must know in the end\nWhen it's time to descend\nThat there is no easy way down\n[Outro]\nThere is no easy way down"
