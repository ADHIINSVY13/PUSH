I'm a motherfucking Cajun\nI feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time\nI goes crazy inside, but when it comes out—it's fine\nLike wine; wait, watch...\nSee? I get better with time like a watch\nOsh B'Gosh,\n \nPosh Spice husband\nCouldn't kick it like I kick it,\n \nbitch! I Kix it\nNo cereal\n, like a landing, I sticks it\nWherever she asks me, after she licks it\n\"That's too explicit\"; well, why you listening?\n*Sniff*\n I smell smoke, and something's sizzling\nThat's her pussy\nSo, hey, pussy; play with pussy or play pussy\n\n[Chorus: Betty Wright & \nLil Wayne\n]\nBut you can't blame me\nIf I set this stage on fire\nHahahaha!\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nThey say, \"You're nobody 'til somebody kills you\nWell, where I'm from, you're nobody 'til you kill somebody\nAnd you know what they say; when you great\nIt's not \"murder,\" it's \"assassinate\"\nSo assassinate me, bitch\n'Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did\nChecking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch\nSame balcony, like, \"Assassinate me, bitch!\"\nIt's Lil Tunechi\nI don't rap, I film movies\nWith my rap\n, you could call me\n\"Mr. Director's Chair,\" yeah, and that's a wrap\nCut! On to the next...\nNot the next scene, bitch, the next check\nSome say the X makes the sex 'spec-\nSo play with the pussy or play pussy\n[Chorus: Betty Wright & \nLil Wayne\n]\nSo you've got so many diamonds\nHey, pussy, lay pussy\nYou wear all the finest clothes\nDo what I... say, pussy, and I say, I say\nAnd your grill is shining\nLay pussy, lay pussy, lay, pussy, haha\nAs you're driving down the streets of gold\nHey, pussy, haha!\nBut you can't blame me\nHey pussy, don't play pussy\nIf I set this stage on fire!\nGet 'em!\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nStraight off the corner of Apple and Eagle\nBraveheart\n, bitch, like the times are medieval\nMarried to the game, divorced the cathedral\nStanding on the corner selling porcelain to people\nForced into evil, it's all in your head\nIt's all so cerebral,\n \ncall me Knievel\nYou follow and I lead you, straight to the needles\nThe bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you\nMomma named Cita—I love you, Cita\n'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?\n'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?\nHe ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither\nHe could see the devil, see the devil in my features\nHe could smell the ether, you can see Cita\nYou can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features\nAnd she don't play neither\n[Chorus: Betty Wright]\nBut you can't blame me\nIf I set this stage on fire!\n[Outro: Lil Wayne]\nC3\n, \n3Peat"
