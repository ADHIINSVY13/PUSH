  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI took each word she said as gospel truth\nThe way a silly little child would\nI can't excuse it on the grounds of youth\nI was no babe in the wild, wild wood\nShe didn't mean it, I should have seen it\nBut now it's too late\n[Verse 1]\nI thought I'd found the girl of my dreams\nNow it seems this is how the story ends\nShe's gonna turn me down and say\n\"Can't we be friends?\"\n[Verse 2]\nI thought for once it couldn't go wrong\nNot for long I can see the way this ends\nShe's gonna turn me down and say\n\"Can't we be friends?\"\n[Bridge]\nWhy should I care though she gave me the air?\nWhy should I cry, heave a sigh and wonder why?\nAnd wonder why\n[Verse 3]\nI thought I'd found the gal I could trust\nWhat a bust, this is how the story ends\nShe's gonna turn me down and say\n\"Can't we be just friends?\""
