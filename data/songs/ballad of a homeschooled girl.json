(Oh, oh, oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nI broke a glass, I tripped and fell\nI told secrets I shouldn't tell\nI stumbled over all my words\nI made it weird, I made it worse\nEach time I step outside, it's social suicide\nIt's social suicide, wanna curl up and die\nIt's social suicide, yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine\nBut don't let me out at night, it's social suicide\nIt's social suicide\n[Post-Chorus]\nAh, ah, ah\nAh, ah, ah\n[Chorus]\nI broke a glass, tripped and fell\nTold secrets I shouldn't tell\nStumbled over all my words\nMade it weird, then made it worse\nEach day that I'm alive, it's social suicide\nIt's social suicide, wanna curl up and die\nIt's social suicide\nIt's social suicide, don't let me out at night\nI'm shocked I'm still alive, it's social suicide\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAh, ah, ah\n[Outro]\nThought your mom was your wife (Ah)\nCalled you the wrong name twice (Ah)\nCan't think of a third line (Ah)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)\nLa-la-la-la-la-la, ugh"
