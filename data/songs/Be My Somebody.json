  "lyrics": "I'm too foggy today\nTo know what you're sayin'\nYour lips are moving so fast\nAnd I just keep praying\nFor them to slow down\nSo I can make some sense\nOf the words that are pouring out\nOf your crooked spout\nLast night was a record to be broken\nIt broke all over the kitchen floor\nOh no, don't you go\nI'm coming back with a rag\nTo wipe away the haze from the days\nWe've forgotten all about\nSo be my somebody tonight\nBe the one who will hold me tight\nHoney, please, please\n'Cause I've been so all alone\nAnd no one will pick up the phone\nSo honey, please stay\nI held your head up, do you remember?\nWhen you wanted to make a blanket out of me\nOh and I can't lie, I been keeping score\nAnd it's your turn to wring me out\nAnd lay me down to dry\n\nSo be my somebody tonight\nBe the one who will hold me tight\nHoney, please, please\n'Cause I've been so all alone\nAnd no one will pick up the phone\nSo honey, please stay\nHoney, please stay\nHoney, please stay"
