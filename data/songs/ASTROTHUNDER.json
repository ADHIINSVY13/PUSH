I can't even get that deep\nTold you, I don't teach (Yeah)\nPractice, oh, no, never preach\nPractice, oh, no, never preach\nInfiltrate the enemy, moving on them randomly\n[Chorus]\nFeels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah\nYeah\nFeels like the life I need, yeah\nFeels like the life I need's a little distant, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Instrumental Outro]"
