  "lyrics": "“Curtains” is the second part of “We All Fall In Love Sometimes.” It was played as a single track and then cut in two for the album, and it is usually played together live.\n[Verse]\nI used to know this old scarecrow\nHe was my song\nMy joy and sorrow\nCast alone between the furrows\nOf a field no longer sown by anyone\nI held a dandelion\nThat said the time had come\nTo leave upon the wind\nNot to return\nWhen summer burned the earth again\nOh...\nOh...\n[Chorus]\nCultivate the freshest flower\nThis garden ever grew\nBeneath these branches\nI once wrote such childish words for you\nBut that's okay\nThere's treasure children always seek to find\nAnd just like us\nYou must have had\nA once upon a time\n[Outro]\nOh...\nOh...\nOh...\nOh...\nOh...\nOh...\nOh...\nOh...\nOh... \n(lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)\nOh... (lovely, lovely, ay-oh, lovely, lovely, ay-oh)"
