  "lyrics": "On December 22nd 2017, Billie Eilish performed a brief ukulele cover of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling In Love” via Jack Francis’s Instagram live.\nWise men say only fools rush in\nBut I can't help falling in love with you\nShall I stay?\nWould it be a sin\nIf I can’t help falling in love with you?\n-(Oh, here's when it gets hard)\nLike a- wait\nLike a river flows\nLike a river flows\n-(I'm just gonna not play it)\nSurely to the sea\nMy darling so it goes\nSome things are meant to be\nTake my hand, take my whole life too\nFor I can’t help falling in love with you"
