  "lyrics": "When I try to sing you say I'm off key\nWhy can't you see how much this hurts me\nWith your perfect beauty and your perfect pitch\nYou're a perfect terror\nWhen I come around must you always put me down\nIf you say my singing is off key my love\nYou will hurt my feelings don't you see my love\nI wish I had an ear like yours\nA voice that would behave\nBut all I have is feelings and the voice God gave\nYou insist my music goes against the rules\nBut rules were never meant for lovesick fools\nI wrote this little song for you but you don't care\nIts a crooked song oh but all my love is there\nThe thing that you would see if you would play your part\nIs even if I'm out of tune I have a gentle heart\nI took your picture with my trusty Rolleiflex\nAnd now all I have developed is a complex\nPossibly in vain I hope you weaken oh my love\nAnd forget these rigid rules that undermine my dream of\nA life of love and music with someone who'll understand\nThat even though I may be out of tune\nWhen I attempt to say how much I love you\nAll that matters is the message that I bring\nWhich is my dear one I love you"
