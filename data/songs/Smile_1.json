  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSmile, though your heart is aching\nSmile, even though it's breaking\nWhen there are clouds in the sky\nYou'll get by\n[Verse 2]\nIf you smile through your fear and sorrow\nSmile, and maybe tomorrow\nYou'll see the sun come shining through\nFor you\n[Verse 3]\nLight up your face with gladness\nHide every trace of sadness\nAlthough a tear may be ever so near\n[Chorus]\nThat's the time you must keep on trying\nSmile, what's the use of crying?\nYou'll find that life is still worthwhile\nIf you just smile\n[Interlude]\nSouriez même si votre cœur se brise\nQuand il y a des nuages dans le ciel\nVous vous en sortirez si vous souriez\nSouriez, souriez\nJe vous adore\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's the time you must keep on tryin'\nSmile, what's the use of cryin'?\nYou'll find that life is still worthwhile\nIf you just smile"
