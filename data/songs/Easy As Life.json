  "lyrics": "[AIDA]\nThis is the moment when\nThe gods expect me to beg for help\nBut I won't even try\nI want nothing in the world\nBut myself to protect me\nAnd I won't lie down, roll over, and die\nAll I have to do is forget how much I love him\nAll I have to do is put my longing to one side\nTell myself that love's an ever-changing situation\nPassion would have cooled and all the magic\nWould have died\nIt's easy, it's easy\nAll I have to do is to pretend I never knew him\nOn those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart\nBetter to have lost him when the ties were barely binding\nBetter the contempt of the familiar cannot start\nIt's easy, it's easy\nUntil I think about him as he was when I last touched him\nAnd how he would have been, were I to be with him today\nThose very rare occasions don't let up, they keep on coming\nAll I've ever wanted and I'm throwing it away\nIt's easy, it's easy as life\n\nBut then I see the faces of a worn, defeated people\nA father and a nation who won't let a coward run\nIs this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages?\nForcing us to move and they're the hardest things we've done\nThey're easy, so easy\nAnd though I'll think about him\n'Til the earth draws in around me\nAnd though I choose to leave him for another kind of love\nThis is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption\nRedeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above\nIt's easy, it's easy as life\nIt's easy as life\nIt's easy as life!"
