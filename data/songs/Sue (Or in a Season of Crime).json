  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSue, I got the job\nWe'll buy the house\nYou'll need to rest\nBut now we'll make it\n[Verse 2]\nSue, the clinic called\nThe x-ray's fine\nI brought you home\nI just said home\n[Verse 3]\nSue, you said you want it writ\nSue, the virgin on your stone\nFor your grave\nWhy, too dark to speak the words?\nFor I know that you have a son\nOh, folly, Sue\n[Verse 4]\nRide the train, I'm far from home\nIn a season of crime none need atone\nI kissed your face\nSue, I've pushed you down beneath the weeds\nEndless faith in hopeless deeds\nI kissed your face, I touched your face\n\n[Bridge]\nSue, goodbye\n[Outro]\nSue, I found your note\nThat you wrote last night\nIt can't be right\nYou went with him\nSue, I never dreamed\nI'm such a fool\nRight from the start\nYou went with that clown"
