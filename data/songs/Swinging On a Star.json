  "lyrics": "Would you like to swing on a star\nCarry moonbeams home in a jar\nAnd be better off than you are\nOr would you rather be a mule?\nA mule is an animal with long funny ears\nKicks up at anything he hears\nHis back is brawny and his brain is weak\nHe's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak\nAnd by the way, if you hate to go to school\nYou may grow up to be a mule\nOr would you like to swing on a star\nCarry moonbeams home in a jar\nAnd be better off than you are\nOr would you rather be a pig?\nA pig is an animal with dirt on his face\nHis shoes are a terrible disgrace\nHe ain't got no manners when he eats his food\nHe's fat and lazy and extremely rude\nBut if you don't care a feather or a fig\nYou may grow up to be a pig\nOr would you like to swing on a star\nCarry moonbeams home in a jar\nAnd be better off than you are\nOr would you rather be a fish?\n\nA fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook\nHe can't write his name or read a book\nAnd to fool the people is his only thought\nAnd though he's slippery, he still gets caught\nBut then if that sort of life is what you wish\nYou may grow up to be a fish\nAnd all the monkeys aren't in a zoo\nEvery day you meet quite a few\nSo you see it's all up to you\nYou can be better than you are\nYou could be swingin' on a star"
