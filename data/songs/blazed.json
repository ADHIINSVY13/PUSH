What's it worth?\nI must be on, so clear to me\n[Chorus: Ariana Grande]\nOnce I have you, I will\nNever let you, never let you—\nOnce I have you, I will\nNever let you, never let you go\nNever let you, never let you go\nNever let you, never let you go\nNever let you, never let you go\nNever let you—\n\n[Refrain: Pharrell Williams & \nAriana Grande\n]\nThere is somethin’ between us\nI can see it right now\nYour magnetic demeanor\nThat’s something can't be found\nI thought that I was dreamin’\n'Til my love came around\nNow I just come on over\nShow you how we get down\nShawty, you can get blazed\n[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]\nLook at you, love, you are the same\nYou have a light you cannot hide\nYes, you may have a different face\nBut your soul is the same inside\nI don't care who is listening\n'Cause they be making fun of this on TV\nThey wouldn’t laugh if they were\nInside my past life with you and they were me\n[Chorus: Ariana Grande]\nOnce I have you, I will\nNever let you, never let you—\nOnce I have you, I will\nNever let you, never let you go\nNever let you, never let you go\nNever let you, never let you go, oh\nNever let you, never let you go, yeah\nNever let you—\n\n[Bridge: Pharrell Williams & \nAriana Grande\n]\nDon't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can\nShawty, you can get blazed\nSleep if you want, and wake up in love again\nShawty, you can get blazed\n[Chorus: Ariana Grande & \nPharrell Williams\n]\nOnce I have you, I will\nNever let you, never let you—\nOnce I (Once I) have you (Have you) I will (I will)\nNever let you, never let you go, uh-huh\n(\nShawty, you can get blazed\n)\nNever let you, never let you go, baby\nNever let you, never let you go, babe\nNever let you, never let you go, hey\nNever let you—"
