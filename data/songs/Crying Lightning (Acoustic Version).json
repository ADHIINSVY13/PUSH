  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOutside the cafe by the cracker factory\nYou were practicing a magic trick\nAnd my thoughts got rude\nAs you talked and chewed\nOn the last of your pick and mix\nSaid \"You're mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before\"\nAs you bit into your strawberry lace\nAnd then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper\nIs all you have left and it was going to waste\n[Bridge]\n[Your pastimes consisted of the strange\nAnd twisted and deranged\nAnd I love that little game you had called\n[Chorus]\nCrying Lightning\nAnd how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons\n[Verse 2]\nThe next time that I caught my own reflection\nIt was on it's way to meet you\nThinking of excuses to postpone\nYou never looked like yourself from the side\nBut your profile could not hide\nThe fact you knew I was approaching your throne\nWith folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache\nStood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war\nAnd though I try so not to suffer the indignity of reaction\nThere was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw\n[Bridge 2]\nYour pastimes consisted of the strange\nAnd twisted and deranged\nAnd I hate that little game you had called\n[Chorus]\nCrying Lightning\nAnd how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons\n[Outro]\nUninviting\nBut not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are\nCrying Lightning\n[Verse 3]\nOh you were reading a book about some idiot and telling me about another\nI was so severely underwhelmed I thought I might never recover\nStraighten the rudder girl and sail me up stairs\nAnd go and find somebody who cares\nWell we might not be the perfect partners but tonight we make a pair\n\n[Bridge 2]\nCrying Lightning\nCrying Lightning\nCrying Lightning\nCrying Lightning\n[Bridge 2]\nCrying"
