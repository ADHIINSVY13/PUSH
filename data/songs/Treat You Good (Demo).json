Cole love his idol again, uh\nRap religion, that's the give back\nAnd I promise, won't be no more Taylor Swift raps\n[?] did that, uh\nThey all thought it was arrogance\nNow they start to believe that Steve Jobs comparison\nI was watching the Tes-Tesla documentary\nJust to see what ideas he stole from [?]\nThe pills is numbing my antenna\nThe alcohol, the painkillers\nEverybody ain't gon' get it like a invitation\nTrump tried to stop pieces at the immigration\nI'ma stop the Nazis  cause all 'em in my base\n\n[Chorus: The Donation]\nAnd I'm gonna treat you good\nOh, baby\nLyrics from Snippet\n[Verse: Pusha T]\nThese my tears in the song\nIf I ain't saying it clear, it's my way of cheerin' you on\n[Chorus: The Donation]\nAnd I'm gonna treat you good\nOh, baby"
