(\nSnow at the beach\n)\nWeird, but fuckin' beautiful\nFlying in a dream (\nFlying in a dream\n)\nStars by the pocketful\nYou wanting me (\nYou wanting me\n)\nTonight feels impossible\nBut it's comin' down\nNo sound, it's all around\n[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, \nLana Del Rey\n]\nLike snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)\nLike snow on the beach\n (Flying in a dream)\nLike snow on the beach\n (You wanting me)\nLike snow, ah\nBut it's comin' down\nNo sound, it's all around\n[Outro: Taylor Swift]\nLike snow on the beach\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\nLike snow on the beach\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)\n(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)"
