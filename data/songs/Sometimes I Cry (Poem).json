  "lyrics": "Sometimes when I'm alone\nI cry because I'm on my own\nThe tears I cry R bitter and warm\nThey flow with life but take no form\nI cry because my heart is torn\nand I find it difficult 2 carry on\nIf I had an ear 2 confide in\nI would cry among my treasured friends\nBut who do u know that stops that long\nTo help another carry on\nThe world moves fast and it would rather pass u by\nthan 2 stop and c what makes u cry\nIt's painful and sad and sometimes I cry\nand no one cares about why."
