  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLook out new world here we come\nBrave, intrepid and then some\nPioneers of maximum\nAudacity whose resumes\nShow that we are just the team\nTo live where others merely dream\nBuilding up a head of steam\nOn the trail we blaze\n[Chorus]\nChanging legend into fact\nWe shall ride into history\nTurning myth into truth\nWe shall surely gaze\nOn the sweet unfolding\nOf an antique mystery\nAll will be revealed\nOn the trail we blaze\n[Verse 2]\nParadise is close at hand\nShangri-la\n the promised land\nSeventh heaven on demand\nQuite unusual nowadays\nVirgin vistas, undefiled\nMinds and bodies running wild\nIn the man behold the child\nOn the trail we blaze\n\n[Chorus]\n[Verse 3]\nThe trail we blaze\nIs a road uncharted\nThrough terra incognita to a golden shrine\nNo place for the traveler\nTo be faint-hearted\nWe are part of the sumptuous grand design\n(Shangri-la the promised land)\nSeventh heaven on demand\nQuite unusual nowadays\nVirgin vistas, undefiled\nMinds and bodies running wild\nIn the man before the child\nOn the trail we blaze"
