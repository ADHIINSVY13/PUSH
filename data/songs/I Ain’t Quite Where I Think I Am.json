  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nFreaky keypad\nBy the retina scan\nI've been given good reason to believe\nI ain't quite where I think I am\nBut it's always worth half a blast\nYou know the face, but you can't see past\n[Refrain]\nThe disco strobes in the stumbling blocks\nWait, there's the other island now\n[Chorus]\nFormation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)\nAnd I can see both islands now\n[Verse 2]\nIt's the intermission\nLet's shake a few hands\nBlank expressions invite me to suspect\nI ain't quite where I think I am\nStackable party guests\nTo fill the awkward silencеs\n[Refrain]\nThe disco strobes in the stumbling blocks\nWait, thеre's the other island now\n\n[Chorus]\nFormation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)\nAnd I can see both islands now\nFrom my vantage point\n[Bridge]\nThe spare set of tingles'll race up your spine\nIf I get it my way\n[Verse 3]\nLooks like the Riviera\nIs coming into land\nEarly predictions would seem to suggest\nI ain't quite where I think I am\n[Chorus]\nFormation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)\nAnd I can see both islands now"
