  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAll my life, I've seen myself through your eyes\nWonderin' if I am good enough for your time\nYou love me but for all the wrong reasons\nAm I somethin' to you and not someone?\n'Cause I feel trapped on this pedestal you put me on\nYou tell me that I'm beautiful, but I think that's an understatement\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I am more than what I am to you\nYou say I'm perfect, but I've got thorns with my petals too\nAnd I won't be confined to your point of view\nI'm breakin' through the glass you put me in\n'Cause my beauty's from within\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh\nMy beauty's from within\nOh\n[Verse 2]\nSo I am done livin' my lifе just for you\nYou watched me wither and now you'll watch mе bloom\nYou're hidin' in the dark, but I'm reachin' for the sun, woo\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I am more than what I am to you\nYou say I'm pretty, but I've got magic that you never knew\nAnd I won't be confined to your point of view\nI'm breakin' through the glass you put me in 'cause\nI am more than what I am to you\nYou say I'm perfect, but I've got thorns with my petals too\nAnd I won't be confined to your point of view\nI'm breakin' through the glass you put me in\n'Cause my beauty's from within"
