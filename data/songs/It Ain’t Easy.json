  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen you climb to the top of the mountain, look out over the sea\nThink about the places perhaps, where a young man could be\nThen you jump back down to the rooftops, look out over the town\nThink about all of the strange things circulating 'round\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't easy, it ain't easy\nIt ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down\n[Verse 2]\nWell, all the people have got their problems, that ain't nothing new\nWith the help of the good Lord, we can all pull on through\nWe can all pull on through, get there in the end\nSometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't easy, it ain't easy\nIt ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down\n[Verse 3]\nSatisfaction, satisfaction, keep me satisfied\nI've got the love of a hoochie coochie woman, she calling from inside\nShe's a-calling from inside\n, \ntrying to get to you\nAll the woman really wants, you can give her something too\n\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't easy, it ain't easy\nIt ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down\nIt ain't easy, it ain't easy\nIt ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down"
