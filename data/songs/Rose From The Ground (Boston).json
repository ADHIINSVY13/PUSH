Rhymes and scissors\n'Cause most of these rappers can't feel us\nBaby brought her friend out the village\nThey tryna scissor, eat them rocks, glitter\nShawty ride and make it alive, they make that a law\nBaby girl fryin' [...] she tryin' us\nHeatin' them racks and glitter\nJacques relayin' and makin' the car\nConnectin' the dot, that's how we above\nWe need to take the shade, hop in the mirage\n[...]\nRunnin' the Track' like thе Jack\nI stop keepin' track, ain't keepin' the track of the medals (Lеt's go)\n[Bridge]\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyy, they rose from the ground (Ground)\nJump, yeah, jump in my world right now (Now)\nOut of the spot 'cause the word got out (Out)\nShe at the gate, know the code by now\nTell by my face that my soul is drowned\nThis black girl on coke, black and white right now\nThis white girl with ass, I can't black— (Ah-ah)\nIf they come to the top of my hill, they go down (Straight up)\nI'm out in the dark, it's just me and my peers (Yeah)\nI look in the mirror and I face my fears\nNot fond of the bullshit, let's get that clear (Nah)\nThe sweat on my face lookin' just like tears (Nah)\nWe flew here together, the jet like an airline, we used to rock coach in the back of Frontier\nUsed to ride Metro, that OSC nigga, \non Don I swear you had no idea\nAt night, would call, no one was there\nAt night with drugs, on war, my friend (Yeah, ah)\nI walk these halls, I walk through walls, I took it all, but in the end—\n[Outro]\nAh-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah\nAh-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah"
