Run it back and they hit replay\nBobby Boy Records, yeah, we celebratin' all day\n[Chorus: Logic]\n(It's a celebration)\nFor the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes (It's a celebration, y'all)\nYou wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time (It's a celebration)\nFor the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes (It's a celebration)\nYou wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time\nAyy, it's a celebration, y'all, celebration now\nWherever I go in the nation, they celebrating my style\nIt's a celebration, y'all, celebration now\nWherever I go in the nation, they celebrate the style\n[Outro: Thalia]\nLogic and his crew played chess mercilessly throughout the album's creation"
