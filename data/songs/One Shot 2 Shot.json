He usually tucks one on him\nWait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre\nNah, I guess not, what the fuck? Oh, my God, it was!\nI never saw him run so fast in my life\nLook at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife\nThere she is, on the ground, being trampled\nI go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her\nGod damn, there just went another damn bullet\nI'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it\nIt's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it\nI scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path\n, ran through it and\nMade it to the front door and collapsed\nOn the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out\nBut I can't see who he's shooting it out with\nBut Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his \nfour-fifth\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nOne shot, two shot, three shots, four shots\nAll I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops\nBodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops\nEverybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off\n[Verse 5: Kon Artis]\nYo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right\nBig ass on my left hand, \nDesert Eagle in my right\nI ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight\nAlthough, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight\nThat's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge\nShot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in\nSwift told me to meet him here\n, so it's clear that the schmuck\nThat shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker\nSo, one shot for the money, two is to stop the show\nThe third's for the bartender\n (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')\nI just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?\nHe tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nOne shot, two shot, three shots, four shots\nAll I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops\nBodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops\nEverybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off"
