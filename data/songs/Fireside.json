  "lyrics": "A beautiful song about how difficult it is to move on from someone you loved, even when you know itâ€™s the right thing to do.\n[Verse 1]\nI can't explain but I wanna try\nThere's this image of you and I\nAnd it goes dancing by\nIn the morning and in the night time\nThere's all these secrets that I can't keep\nLike in my heart there's that hotel suite\nAnd you lived there so long\nIt's kind of strange now you're gone\n[Chorus]\nI'm not sure if I should show you what I've found\nHas it gone for good, or is it coming back around?\nIsn't it hard to make up your mind\nWhen you're losing and your fuse is fireside?\n[Verse 2]\nThere's all those places we used to go\nAnd I suspect you already know\nBut that place on memory lane you like still looks the same\nBut something about it's changed\n[Chorus]\nI'm not sure if I should show you what I've found\nHas it gone for good, or is it coming back around?\nIsn't it hard to make up your mind\nWhen you're losing and your fuse is fireside?\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I thought I was yours forever\nOr maybe I was mistaken\nBut I just cannot manage to make it through the day\nWithout thinking of you lately\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nI'm not sure if I should show you what I've found\nHas it gone for good, or is it coming back around?\nIsn't it hard to make up your mind\nWhen you're losing and your fuse is fireside?"
