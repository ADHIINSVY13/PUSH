  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNo New Year's Day to celebrate\nNo chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away\nNo first of spring, no song to sing\nIn fact, here's just another ordinary day\n[Verse 2]\nNo April rain, no flowers bloom\nNo wedding Saturday within the month of June\nBut what it is, it's something true\nMade up of these three words that I must say to you\n[Chorus]\nI just called to say I love you\nI just called to say how much I care\nI just called to say I love you\nAnd I mean it from the bottom of my heart\n[Verse 3]\nNo summer's high, no warm July\nNo harvest moon to light one tender August night\nNo autumn breeze, no falling leaves\nNot even time for birds to fly to southern skies\n[Verse 4]\nNo Libra sun\n, \nno Halloween\nNo giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring\nBut what it is, though old, so new\nTo fill your heart like no three words could ever do\n\n[Chorus]\nI just called to say I love you\nI just called to say how much I care, I do\nI just called to say I love you\nAnd I mean it from the bottom of my heart\nI just called to say I love you, yeah\nI just called to say how much I care, I do\nI just called to say I love you\nAnd I mean it from the bottom of my heart\n[Outro]\nOf my heart, of my heart\nBaby, of my heart"
