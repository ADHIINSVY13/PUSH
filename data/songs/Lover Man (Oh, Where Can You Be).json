  "lyrics": "I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad\nI'd long to try something I'd never had\nNever had no kissing, ooh, what I've been missing\nLover man, oh, where can you be?\nThe night is cold and I'm so all alone\nI'd give my soul just to call you my own\nGot a moon above me but no one's here to love me\nLover man, oh, where can you be?\nI've heard it said that the thrill of romance\nCan be like a heavenly dream\nAnd I'll go to bed with a prayer\nThat you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems\nSomeday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears\nAnd whisper sweet, little things in my ear\nHugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing baby\nLover man, oh, where can you be?\nI've heard it said that the thrill of romance\nCould be like a heavenly dream\nAnd I'll go to bed with the prayer\nThat you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems\nSomeday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears\nThen whisper sweet little things in my ear\nHugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing\nLover man, oh, where can you be?\nLover man, oh, where can you be?"
