  "lyrics": "He takes me to the places you and I used to go\nHe tells me over and over that he loves me so\nHe gives me love that I never got from you\nHe loves me too, his love is true\nWhy can't he be you\nHe never fails to call and tell me I'm on his mind\nAnd I'm lucky to have such a guy; I hear it all the time\nAnd he does all the things that you would never do\nHe loves me, too, his love is true\nWhy can't he be you\nHe's not the one who dominates my mind and soul\nAnd I should love him so, 'cause he loves me, I know\nBut his kisses leave me cold\nHe sends me flowers, calls on the hour, just to prove his love\nAnd my friends say when he's around, I'm all he speaks of\nAnd he does all the things that you would never do\nHe loves me too, his love is true\nWhy can't he be you"
