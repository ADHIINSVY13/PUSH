  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIf you're searchin' out for somethin', don't try so hard\nIf you're feelin' kind of nothin', don't try so hard\nWhen your problems seem like mountains, you feel the need to find some answers\nYou can leave it for another day, don't try so hard\n[Verse 2]\nBut if you fall and take a tumble, it won't be far\nIf you fail, you mustn't grumble, thank your lucky stars\nJust savor every mouthful and treasure every moment\nWhen the storms are raging 'round you, stay right where you are\n[Chorus]\nOh, don't try so hard\nOh, don't take it all to heart\nIt's only fools, they make these rules\nDon't try so hard\n[Verse 3]\nOne day, you'll be a sergeant major, oh, you'll be so proud\nScreamin' out your bloody orders, hey, but not too loud\nPolish all your shiny buttons, dress as lamb instead of mutton\nBut you never had to try to stand out from the crowd\n[Bridge]\nOh, what a beautiful world\nThis is the life for me\nOh, what a beautiful world\nIt's the simple life for me\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nOh, don't try so hard\nOh, don't take it all to heart\nIt's only fools, they make these rules\nDon't try so hard\n[Outro]\nDon't try so hard\nDon't try so hard"
