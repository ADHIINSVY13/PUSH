He rep the Ville when he spit it\nTold you he'd be back with a record deal and he did it, nigga\nFuck spinnin' on my pivot, homie\nI'm finna travel 'til the refs blow the whistle on me\nI got a whole fuckin' city that's just sittin' on me\nBut yet, it fits on my back, my state is sittin' on that\nWill I drop? I think not, I get up while they stop\nLike the sleeves on tank tops, they ain't give it all they got\nSo they flop, so, hey, watch how I'm finna take they spot\nNow I'm startin' and they not, let me show you how to stay hot\nI play not, man, I'm killin' 'em, even your idols feelin' 'em, dog\nThe same nigga used to chill in the mall\nWhile they was still in the mall, I was up there spillin' my rap\nThe hero fightin' villains just to put the Ville on the map\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I am (\nHere's to the Roc\n)\nYeah, yeah, and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell 'em\nMr. Fayettenam (\nMr. Roc-a-Fella\n)\nWave your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (\nHere's to the Roc\n)\nHey, yeah, this the last call for alcohol, this is the fuckin' Warm Up, yeah (\nMr. Roc-a-Fella\n)\nGet your ass up off the wall, yeah\n[Outro]\nYeah, man, so, shit, this was The Warm Up\nUm, what can I say, what can I say?\nIf you heard The Come Up, you know what that was about, \njust a lil' nigga from North Carolina\n, man\nFayettenam, to be exact\nMoved to NYC\nUm, you know, chasin' the dream\nI used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as like the tool to get to New York\nThat's all I really had, I ain't have no family up here or nothin' like that\nI came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college\nAnd the, and the whole time, I ain't even think I was gon' have to finish college, I just thought, you know, I'd be signed by like my freshman year, so I wouldn't have to finish college\nBut it didn't happen like that, obviously\nNigga graduated, um, and things started fallin' into place\nI got way more focused, I dropped The Come Up\nAnd I look at The Come Up like niggas, like, like how kinda how when I was in high school\nJust picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out\nAnd I know it's a lotta niggas out there that know that feeling, man\nYou try out, you, you think you deserve to be on the team\nAnd you go that day to look at the cut list\nYou wake up, you know, you can't even sleep, you just like, \"Damn, I'm gon' make the team tomorrow, I did my thing in tryouts\"\nYou go to the list\nAll the niggas is lookin' at they names on the list, some niggas is like, \"Aw shit, I see my name, I'm good, I'm good, nigga, I'm good, I see my name\"\nAnd you lookin' for your name\nAnd you kinda playin' the back, tryna wait 'til niggas clear out 'cause you not sure\nAnd \nyou go to the list and, and your name ain't there\nLike, and you like, \"How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him\"\nSo a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas'll go harder\nSo that's how I kinda took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up\n'Cause ever since I was like fifteen, I thought I was supposed to be signed\nBut it didn't hapâ€” you know, obviously, shit, everything happens for a reason\nSo, shit, fast forward to The Warm Up, this is just me, like, you know\nBein' that nigga that's practicin' and makin' sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts\nThere's no way the fuckin' coach is passin' up on me, my nigga\nSo that's what this whole mixtape was about and, lo and behold, you know\nAs I'm finishin' up the mixtape, the deal come\nYou know? Thank God, I'm blessed, everything happens for a reason\nAnd it couldn't have been with a more fuckin', with a better fuckin' squad, nigga, I got\nYou, you know the niggas I got on my squad\nIf you, if you listen to this, then you might've heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that\nShout out to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely\nYou know?
