The life of a starchild\nThe life of a starchild.\nThe life of a star.\nI know why you love it, all those lights\nI know why you dream of it\nthe view from the heights.\nBut all the pretty smoke going to\nfill up your lungs,\npretty smoke going to make you feel numb\nI know why you love it\nall of those likes. .. lies\nWhy you moving to LA?\nYou want to be a starchild\nhoping all your demons go away\nI am begging you to stay\nbut you politely decline.\nWant to live the life of a starchild.\n\nStar. The lifе of a starchild\nThe life of a starchild\nThe lifе of star.\nSports cars and dollar bills\nHouse in Hollywood Hills\nLive next to Marilyn\nmy love go travelling, palm trees and heroin\nignore the heroin, strip searches in the dark\nplease feel my broken heart.\nWhy you moving to LA?\nyou want to be a starchild\nhoping all your demons go away.\nI am begging you to stay\nbut you politely decline\nWant to live the life of a starchild,\nthe life of a starchild,\nthe life of a starchild.\nthe life of a starchild, just a starchild, just a starchild\nOh yeah!"
