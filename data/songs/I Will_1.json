They want the crown on my head, I said, \n\"Chill\nIf you want me to murder this beat, then I will\"\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nNow this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said\nGod bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead\nThey called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head\n'Cause I said, \"Motherfuck school,\" and instead went to special ed\nSippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time\nThat I startled my mom and had her scared to death\nWord to Method Man\nShe heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio\nShe was like, \"What the heck was that?\"\nShe went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck\nThen I jumped out with a sword and yelled, \"Protect your neck\"\nNow bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel\nBetter yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always\nRejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice\nJust a third of my will will overpower yours\nUsing about a fourth to create the amount of force\nIt'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol\nEnter my house of horrors with a thousand floors\nGot a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns\nBut I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store\nI'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse\nThan a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse\nNothing means more than respect,\n \nso when I curse\nYou could say I swore to protect\nMy image,\n \nI have zero time or regard for\nA never-was\n, \nbeen claiming rap when it's not yours\nIf it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors\nRun-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks\nYeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link\nRest of these youngins of mine\nTime to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds\n'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why\nI need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes\nBorn a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it\nNext door to an abortion clinic\nNewborn infants tortured and tormented\nWith their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented\nTheir corpses get ornamented\nThe coroner with a storage bin rented\nTo store them in and the torsos of forty women\n reported missin'\nDistorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending\nThis is only the beginning\nSo, Lord, forgive me, I'm hearing voices\nI can't ignore them anymore, they're winning\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI thought I heard a voice in my head that said \"Kill\"\nI had no other choice that was left except fill\nMy pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil\nHe wants me to murder this beat, so I will\nHe told me there are doubters who question my skill\nThey wanna put my style to the test, am I still\nThe best? They want the crown on my head, I said, \"Chill\nIf you want me to murder this beat, then I will\"\n[Outro: Eminem]\nAnd I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)\nI do my best to try to block it (Redrum)\nI've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)\nI'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)"
