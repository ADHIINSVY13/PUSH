  "lyrics": "[Instrumental intro]\n[Verse 1]\nAnother party's over\nAnd I'm left cold sober\nMy baby left me for somebody new\nI don't wanna talk about it\nWant to forget about it\nWanna be intoxicated\nWith that special brew\n[Bridge]\nSo come and get me, let me\nGet in that sinking feeling\nThat says my heart\nIs on an all time low\nSo don't expect me\nTo behave perfectly\nAnd wear that sunny smile\nMy guess is I'm in\nFor a cloudy and overcast\nDon't try and stop me\n'Cause I'm heading\nFor that stormy weather soon\n[Chorus]\nI'm causing a mild sensation\nWith this new occupation\nI'm permanently glued\nTo this extraordinary mood\nSo now move over\nAnd let me take over\nWith my melancholy blues\n\n[Interlude]\n[Chorus]\nI'm causing a mild sensation\nWith this new occupation\nI'm in the news\nI'm just getting used\nTo my new exposure\nSo come into my enclosure\nAnd meet my melancholy blues\n[Piano Solo Outro]"
