Swear there is no-nothing after\nI'm the bishop, I'm the pastor\nI'm the god MC and you don't want to get caught in the rapture\nI would probably burn your whole colony\nChew you up then spit you out, you nothing but a Polla Seed\nFollow hood policies\nCompton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be\nYou never seen a killer 'til you seen one on side of me\nThat green on the side of me\nFuckin' all about my fuckin' money like a sodomy\nFuck them bitches properly\nI do it\nI do it, done it, run it like I grown legs by the hundreds\nMy pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry\nBeen hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs\nBummy, NEVER\nMiddle of a conversation, I cough up a feather\nAnd get ready for the detonation, I bomb on whoever\nWhatever you 'bout, I'm 'bout it twice\nLike a woman who give twins' life\nI steered right through your fan base every time\nTapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines\nEvery line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways\nI'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave\nSasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is Sasquatch can rap\n\n[Chorus]\nMotherfucker, I'm iller\n[Verse 2]\nOk, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track\nThe people like \"What the fuck happened? And where Wayne be at?\nThere's some boy named K-Dot and he's a maniac!\nI think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie, in fact\nHe spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat\nHe just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back\nI think that boy from Iraq, I think y'all boys better know that\nHe got it on lock like a Low Jack\nHeading straight for the top like a ball cap\nY'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back\nWhere y'all came from\"\nAin't one better than the one\nWho can write like Langston Hughes\nFrom the brain off top like a bottle, dude, get a hollow where you swallow food\nGet a model, bet she swallow, who? Me\nBet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea\nRecognize who I be, K-Dot, motherfucker\nDot, motherfucker, hot motherfucker\nDrop top when ya popped with the Glock, on sight, motherfucker\nSight, motherfucker\nRide, motherfucker\nDie, motherfucker\nWhen I go pop, pop\nOpen up, close shop like a retail spot\nEverybody know I be where the money lie\nEat where the money lie, shit where the money lie\nSleep where the money lie, bitch that's no lie\nLet the truth be told\nK Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stove – burn up\n\n[Outro]\nRappers: I'm iller\nDig it, like it, love it a lot"
