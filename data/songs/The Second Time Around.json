  "lyrics": "Love is lovelier the second time around\nJust as wonderful with both feet on the ground\nIt's that second time you hear your love song sung\nMakes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young\nLove's more comfortable the second time you fall\nLike a friendly home the second time you call\nWho can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?\nThere are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet\nI'm oh so glad we met the second time around\nWho can say what brought us to this miracle we've found\nThere are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet\nI'm oh so glad we met the second time around"
