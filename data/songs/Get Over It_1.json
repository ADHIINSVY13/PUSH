  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStarted off with one kiss, standing in a red dress\nSilhouette the sunset, ripple in the breeze\nFinished with a book and saying, \"Better off friends\"\nEven though you weren't friends before you'd ever meet\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLovers to strangers, oh, watch how it changes\nIt's such a shame to end like this\nTo end like this, get over it\n[Chorus]\nI know we failed, at least we tried\nOh, I, I know we did\nYeah, your words will bruise my pride\nTonight, it stings a bit\nIn a losing state of mind\nI cry, is that all there is?\nAnd it hurts to say goodbye\nBut I'll get over it\n[Verse 2]\nShouting from a sentence, but it's not the way you meant it\nShould have given more attention into the little red lights\nI no longer know you, I used to love the old you\nBut I guess I should have told you way before tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLovers to strangers, oh, watch how it changes\nIt's such a shame to end like this\nTo end like this, get over it\n[Chorus]\nI know we failed, at least we tried\nOh, I, I know we did\nYeah, your words will bruise my pride\nTonight, it stings a bit\nIn a losing state of mind\nI cry, is that all there is?\nAnd it hurts to say goodbye\nBut I'll get over it\n[Bridge]\nOne day, there will be someone else in your life\nAnd I know my love, it can't be helped tonight\nI knew you better than I know myself, but it's time\nYeah, it's time to get over it\n[Chorus]\nI know we failed, at least we tried\nOh, I, I know we did\nYeah, your words will bruise my pride\nTonight, it stings a bit\nIn a losing state of mind\nI cry, is that all there is?\nAnd it hurts to say goodbye\nBut I'll get over it"
