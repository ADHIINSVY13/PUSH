  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSometimes, you look the same\nJust like you did before the accident\nWhen you're starin' into space\nIt's hard to believe you don't remember it\nWoke up in the ambulance\nYou pieced it all together on the drive\n[Chorus]\nI know you don't remember calling me\nBut I told you even then you looked so pretty\nIn a hospital bed, I remember you said\nYou were scared\nAnd so was I\n[Verse 2]\nIn a standstill on the 5\nThought it was unusually early traffic\nUsually, I don't panic\nI just wanted to be on time\nWhen I saw the ambulances on the shoulder\nI didn't even think of pullin' over\nI pieced it all together late that night\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know you don't remember calling me\nBut I told you even then you looked so pretty\nIn a hospital bed, I remember you said\nYou were scared\nAnd so was I\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat if it happened to you on a different day?\nOn a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?\nOr a neighborhood street where the little kids play?\nOr the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?\nWhat if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car\nWhat if you were remote? No one knows where you are\nIf you changed anything, would you not have survived?\nYou're alive, you're alive, you're alive\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know you don't remember calling me\nBut I told you even then you looked so pretty\nIn your hospital bed, I remember you said\nYou were scared\nAnd so am I"
