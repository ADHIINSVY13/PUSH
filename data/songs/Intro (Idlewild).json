I feel as if, you know, they're taking jobs from us, from us trained actors and I feel as if they should just leave it to the pros\n[Big Boi]\nMan, shut your ass up. You tellin' me if you made a song and it was jammin', we ain't 'posed to listen to it? Man, these boys got opportunity, man, let them do they thing. And why you talkin' like that? Ain't you from Bankhead? Anyway, I heard that that Idlewild shit gonna be fire. I'ma be there on Friday, and where yo' pussy ass gonna be, nigga? Tryna get some work.
