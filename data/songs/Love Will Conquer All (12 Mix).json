  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDo you really want to know\nJust how long love will last?\nWill all of the bad times pass?\nHow can we make things right?\nOoh and why, why is the world so unkind?\nWe surely can find peace of mind\nIf we only see the light\nCan't you see that?\n[Chorus]\nHere we are\nOut here, me and you\nReaching out to each other\nIs all that we can do\nWhoa, here we stand trying not to fall\nOh, there's no need to worry\nLove will conquer all\n[Verse 2]\nCan somebody tell me why\nWhy do our dreams go wrong?\nWhy can't we all belong?\nOoh, where did we start?\nOh, and tell me when\nWhen will we ever learn?\nThere's nowhere else we can turn\nThe truth is in our hearts\nHere we are together\n\n[Chorus]\nHere we are\nOut here, me and you\nReaching out to each other\nIs all that we can do\nWhoa, here we stand trying not to fall\nThere's no need\nLove will conquer all\nOh\n[Bridge]\nSometimes the road gets hard to travel\nSometimes the pain's too much to bear\nSometimes when life seems to unravel\nThat's the time oh to say\nWe're gonna make it anyway\n[Chorus]\nHere we are\nOut here, me and you\nReaching out to each other\nIs all that we can do\nWhoa, here we stand trying not to fall\nThere's no need\nLove will conquer all\nWhoa here we are\nOut here, me and you\nReaching out to each other\nIs all that we can do\nWhoa ooh\nGive love a chance\nHere we are\nOut here, me and you\nReaching out to each other\nIs all that we can do\nWhoa, here we stand trying not to fall\nThere's no need\nLove will conquer all\n\n[Outro]\nOh, ooh\nOhh\nGive love a chance\nOh, ooh"
