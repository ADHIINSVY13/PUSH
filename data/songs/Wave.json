  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSo close your eyes, for that's a lovely way to be\nAware of things your heart alone was meant to see\nThe fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together\n[Verse 2]\nYou can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea\nDon't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me\nThe fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together\n[Bridge]\nWhen I saw you first the time was half past three\nWhen your eyes met mine it was eternity\n[Verse 3]\nBy now we know the wave is on its way to be\nJust catch the wave, don't be afraid of loving me\nThe fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together\n[Bridge]\nWhen I saw you first the time was half past three\nWhen your eyes met mine it was eternity\n[Verse 3]\nBy now we know the wave is on its way to be\nJust catch that wave, don't be afraid of loving me\nThe fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together\n\n[Outro]\nTogether\nTogether"
