All the enjoyment\nI'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend\nIt's not what he's made for\nWhat was I made for?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I, 'cause I\nI don't know how to feel\nBut I wanna try\nI don't know how to feel\nBut someday, I might\nSomeday, I might\n[Outro]\nThink I forgot how to be happy\nSomethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be\nSomethin' I wait for\nSomethin' I'm made for\nSomethin' I'm made for"
