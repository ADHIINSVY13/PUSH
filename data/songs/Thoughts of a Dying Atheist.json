Yeah\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it scares the hell out of me\nAnd the end is all I can see\nAnd it scares the hell out of me\nAnd the end is all I can see\nYeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, woah\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Chorus]\nAnd it scares the hell out of me\nAnd the end is all I can see\nAnd it scares the hell out of me\nAnd the end is all I can see\nYeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, woah"
