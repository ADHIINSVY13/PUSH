Shoot! Kill your leaders!\nAim! Kill them all!\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Bridge]\nThey'll try to steal your life\nSo watch your back\nYou're not alone\nBut you must actualise\nThe first attack\n\n[Verse 2]\nOppose and disagree\nDestroy demonocracy\n[Chorus]\nLose control\nAn increasing pace\nWarped and bewitched\nIn time to erase\nWhatever they say\nThese people are torn\nWild and bereft\nAssassin is born, yeah"
