  "lyrics": "The sun doesn't like you, you always get burned\nStay in the shade and watch the world turn\nBetter find a new place to lay on the ground\nCan't stay where you are or you're gonna be found\nAnd time won't pass you by\nAnd I won't tell you lies\nSo tonight we can build a fire\nIn the open field past the razor wire\nSneak by the dogs when they go to sleep\nBring part of yourself that you'll let me keep\n'Cause time won't pass us by\nAnd I won't tell you lies\nSomeday I will ask you why, but not now\nAnd time won't pass us by\nAnd you won't tell me lies\nSomeday we all have to die, but not now"
