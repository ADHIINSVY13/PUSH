  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLike a flower waiting to bloom\nLike a lightbulb in a dark room\nI'm just sitting here waiting for you\nTo come on home and turn me on\n[Verse 2]\nLike the desert waiting for the rain\nLike a schoolkid waiting for the spring\nI'm just sitting here waiting for you\nTo come on home and turn me on\n[Verse 3]\nAnd my poor heart, it's been so dark\nSince you've been gone\nAfter all, you're the one who turns me off\nBut you're the only one who can turn me back on\n[Verse 4]\nMy hi-fi is waiting for a new tune\nMy glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes\nI'm just sitting here waiting for you\nTo come on home and turn me on\nTurn me on"
