Let me show your ass a little thing\nEvery time I walk in this bitch, fresh, feelin' my fur for the fish\nShe want to hold a nigga dick for the piss\nTo the squat for the flick\nGive me your thoughts for a bit\nRight, gon' hit the weed, gon' head, just cough lil' bit\nCum in her mouth, couple kids lost, could've been a good spouse\n[Outro]\nWake the fuck up, baby Jack!\nFuck, I was dreamin', fuck\nJunior, get the fuck up\nFuck, I cummed on my boxers, fuck!\nGet yo' ass up, boy\nFuck they want? Fuck\nBaby Jacques, wake the fuck up, get yo' ass downstairs\nShut up, bitch, fuck\nJunior, Junior! Junior! What the hell?\nI gotta get the fuck out of here, fuck this"
