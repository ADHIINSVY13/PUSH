  "lyrics": "This song is the early version of “Exo-Politics”. It featured a middle-eastern extended introduction and the theme of the lyrics is focused on demons.\n[Verse 1]\nOpen the skies over me\nI am waiting patiently\nI'll wait for the sign\nWhisper through centuries\nSecrets locked up lonely\nAnd I'm waiting until\n[Chorus 1]\nStop asking yourself why\nYou can't see the symbols in your eyes\nStop asking where to find\nThe truth to compensate your lies\n[Refrain]\nSo it forms in my mind\nI am searching for a twisting world\nAnd there's no scars on my side\n[Verse 2]\nStop asking yourself why\nYou can't see the symbols in your eyes\nStop asking, where to find\nThe truth to compensate your lies\n[Chorus 2]\nWell I'm waiting patiently\nI’m waiting for a sign\nWell I’m waiting so patiently\nBut I’ll wait for the truth"
