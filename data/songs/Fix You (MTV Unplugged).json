  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Jung Kook, \nV\n, \nJin & RM\n, \nJimin\n]\nWhen you try your best, but you don't succeed\nWhen you get what you want, but not what you need\nWhen you feel so tired, but you can't sleep\nStuck in reverse\nWhen the tears come streaming down your face\nWhen you lose something you can't replace\nWhen you love someone, but it goes to waste\nCould it be worse?\n[Chorus: Jung Kook, \nJin\n]\nLights will guide you home\nAnd ignite your bones\nAnd I will try to fix you\n[Verse 2: Jung Kook & RM, \nV & SUGA\n]\nHigh up above or down below\nWhen you're too in love to let it go\nBut if you never try, you'll never know\nJust what you're worth\n[Chorus: Jimin & j-hope, \nJimin, Jin & RM\n]\nLights will guide you home\nAnd ignite your bones\nAnd I will try to fix you\n\n[Instrumental: RM]\n(Let the beat in)\n[Bridge: Jimin & RM, \nJin & SUGA\n, \nV & j-hope\n, \nJung Kook & RM\n]\nTears stream down your face\nWhen you lose something you cannot replace\nTears stream down your face, and I\nTears stream down your face\nI promise you I will learn from my mistakes\nTears stream down your face, and I\n[Chorus: V]\nLights will guide you home\nAnd ignite your bones\nAnd I will try to fix you"
