We need a monument\nAnd change will come, and change will come\nIs there anybody there? (Anybody there?)\nAnybody there? (Anybody there?)\nHey!\n[Chorus]\nAmen,\n \nit was the feast and the famine\nAmen,\n \nit was the feast and the famine\nIt was the feast and the famine\nFeast and the famine\n[Outro]\nAmen, where is the monument\nTo the dreams we forget?\n(Amen) We need a monument\nAnd change will come, and change will come\nIs there anybody there? (Anybody there?)\nAnybody there? (Anybody there?)\nHey!\n\n[Instrumental Outro]"
