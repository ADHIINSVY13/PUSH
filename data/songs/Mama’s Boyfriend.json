Just kill the charm\nYou ain't interested in me, you just tryna fuck my mom\nWe are the voices of our parents' bad choices\nThe aftermath of divorces, the kids of bitter split-ups\nAnd babysitters, grandparents that don't know what do to with us\nAnd the last thing I want to see is Mama's new nigga\nYou ol' Old Spice-wearing, short chain-wearing\nDress shoes and jogging pants-wearing, church sock-wearing\nWhen you first stop caring about your appearance?\nWhen you get here anyway? I already got parents\nDon't try to put me in line, I already got crayons\nMy mama said I could do it, I already got clearance\nKeep your hands off my mama, how Anita got Clarence\nYeah, I know she look good, but you need to stop staring\nI drew a picture of her that'd make her proud\nBut the door was locked, and the TV up so loud\nI scream out, \"I ain't going to sleep no time soon!\nAnd when I do, I'm sleeping in my mama room!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't like you, nigga\nIf I was old enough, I'd fight you, nigga\nI want to run over you with my bike, you nigga\nDon't go to sleep at night, you nigga\nWhen I become my mama's boyfriends?\nWhen I become my mama's boyfriends?\n[Verse 2]\nTwenty years later, where has the time gone?\nNow, a nigga dating, having problems of his own\nAnd now, a nigga grown, and the tables turned around\nI never thought I ever raise another nigga's child\nHe don't like his mama boyfriends, just like me\nDon't wanna do the wrong thing,\n \nthat's very un-Spike Lee\nBut he be like Deebo 'round his mama 'nem\n'Cause when she here, he be quiet\nWhen she leave, he be talking again\nHe be wilding again—be calm\nI don't drink the drama or sip the Dom Tyler Perry-on\nYou gon' marry my mom?\nLook, I don't read palms, and I don't read psalms\nBut I did take lil' man to church, took lil' man to school\n\"Look, lil' man, kids don't make the rules\nEven though I ain't raise you, and you your mama angel\nDon't get it twisted, baby boy—I'll Ving Rhames you\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI never liked you niggas\nWho knew, one day, I'd be just like you niggas?\nUgh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas\nUgh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas\nWhen I become my mama's boyfriends?\nWhen I become my mama's boyfriends?"
