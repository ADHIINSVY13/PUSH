Them boys behind your back, yuh\nThe same ones in the front, calling your phone like, \"Where you at?\"\nI need some help, I need some hoes, I need some money\nI need new clothes up on my back, spot me something\nTell me why I haven't seen you in awhile\nPussy boy, fuck your friendship I don't want to reconcile\nBitch\n[Chorus]\nYou think you wylin'\nYou think you stylin' on me\nBoy, you ain't even a challenge\nI ain't worried about you boy\nMore worried about the down payment of my island\nPull up to the show, we get violent\nYou think you wylin'\nYou think you stylin' on me\nBoy, you ain't even a challenge\nI ain't worried about you boy\nMore worried about the down payment of my island\nPull up to the show, we get violent\nYou think you wylin'\nYou think you stylin' on me\nBoy, you ain't even a challenge\nI ain't worried about you boy\nMore worried about the down payment of my island\nPull up to the show, we get violent"
