  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nWhen you leave us through the patient doors\nThat rattle in your ear will be the sound of our applause\nRapturous, considered and due\nOh, the nasty laughter and desperate smirks\nAre tangled in the boredom where our brittle kisses lurk\nWell, how can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?\n[Chorus]\nAnd the shards of past attraction lie visible but shy\nAnd blunt and weak and worn\nAway by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak\nOh, the shards of past attraction lie visible but shy\nAnd blunt and weak and worn\nAway by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak\n[Post-Chorus]\nIn the trap\nYou only want to be the first to laugh\nYou only want to be the first in the sandtrap\nYou only want to be the first to laugh\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nAnd you climb in holes and sink the claws\nRing out like the plan she'd had just sent us all towards\nFarewell, farewell, farewell"
