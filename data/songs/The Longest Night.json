  "lyrics": "You know a love so fine, so high above\nGoes on forever but the road is rough\nReaching for another as truth will show\nTry to live without it but you can't let go\nWe don't talk about it, we got no doubt\nWe can love each other when the lights go out\nI got nobody, my bird has flown\nAnyone can see I'm walking alone, walking alone\nIn your quiet moments, in your silent prayer\nI'll be with you baby, I'll be there\nIn your darkest hour, on your longest night\nI'll be with you baby, make it right\nOn your longest night\nYou know it breaks my heart and it hurts my pride\nTo know I lost you to the world outside\nFeelings when you touch me, they rise and fall\nTry to live without it, ain't no love at all\nWe don't talk about it but somebody knows\nWe can love each other when the candle glows\nOpen my eyes and the moment is gone\nAnyone can see I'm walking alone, walking alone\n\nIn your darkest hour, on your longest night\nI'll be with you baby, make it right\nNobody cries, nobody cries, cries\nFor the pain I feel\nNobody knows, nobody knows\nAnd it makes me wanna die\nIn your quiet moments, in your silent prayer\nI'll be with you baby, I'll be there\nIn your darkest hour, on your longest night\nI'll be with you baby, make it right\nOn your longest night\nOh baby, so in love with you\nIt could be your longest night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night\nBe your longest night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night, tonight\nGonna be here all night, standing all night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night\nBe your longest, longest, longest night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night\nGonna be here all night, standing all night"
