  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCame in for the embers\nStayed out for the breeze\nI need to feel elements to remind me\nThere's beauty when it's bleak\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStuck out long before lights down\nWhy do I breathe? Oh, I know\n[Chorus]\nThe more that I love, the less that I feel\nThe times that I jumped never were real\nThey say that all scars will heal, but I know\nMaybe I won't\nBut the waves won't break my boat\nBut the waves won't brеak my boat\n[Verse 2]\nThe stones crash on the boardwalk\nThе wind rush through the trees\nI keep my eyes peeled\nThe memories always fall short\nOf what we could've been\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLeft out long before last call\nWhat do I need? Oh, I know\n\n[Chorus]\nThe more that I love, the less that I feel\nThe times that I jumped never were real\nThey say that all scars will heal, but I know\nMaybe I won't\nBut the waves won't break my boat\nBut the waves won't break my boat\n[Bridge]\nBut the waves won't break my boat\nThe waves won't break my boat\n[Chorus]\nThe more that I love, the less that I feel\nThe times that I jumped never were real\nThey say that all scars will heal, but I know\nMaybe I won't\nAnd the waves won't break my boat"
