  "lyrics": "Tulio and Miguel sing this song in El Dorado at a party that, the local people mistaking them for gods, was thrown in their honor.\n[Verse 1: Elton John]\nI hardly think I'm qualified\nTo come across all sanctified\nI just don't cut it with the cherubim\nThe town's already on its knees\nBeing worshipped is a breeze\nI barely know the words to any hymn\n[Verse 2: Randy Newman]\nListen, if we don't comply\nWith the locals' wishes I\nCan see us being sacrificed or stuffed\nLet's be gods, the perks are great\nEl Dorado on a plate\nLocal feeling should not be rebuffed\n[Chorus: Elton John, \nElton John & Randy Newman\n]\nIt's tough to be a god\nTread where mortals have not trod\nBe deified when really you're a sham\nBe an object of devotion\nBe the subject of psalms\nIt's a terrifying notion\nAll those prayers and those salaams\nAny normal man would bridle\nIf he's forced to be an idol\nAnd a normal man's exactly what I am\n\n[Verse 3: Elton John]\nAll the same, it's pretty clear\nThe scoundrels don't keep much up here\nThey must have zillions under lock and key\nBut gods can force them to unleash\nEnough to make us nouveau riche\nBeyond our wildest dreams, so follow me!\n[Verse 4: Randy Newman]\nCan't you see I won't relax\nIf religious maniacs\nTell me I'm all-powerful and sublime\nHow can I be their belief\nWhen I'm lying through my teeth?\nWhy don't we just say, \"some other time\"?\n[Chorus: Elton John, \nElton John & Randy Newman\n]\nIt's tough to be a god\nBut if you get the people's nod\nCount your blessings, keep them sweet is my advice\nBe nirvana, be salvation\nBe all things to all men\nButter up your congregation\nEvery Sunday score a ten\nThe alternative is dire\nSimply frying pan to fire\nSo sign on two new gods for paradise, paradise"
