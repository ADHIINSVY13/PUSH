  "lyrics": "[AMNERIS]\nFrom deep within the tomb, a gentle light still shone\nShowing me my path as I ascended to the throne\nCertain in my heart that ancient wars must cease\nThe lovers' deaths gave birth to a reign of peace\nAnd their story\nAnd my journey\nAnd the lesson they provide\nDraw their strength and inspiration\nFrom a love that never died"
