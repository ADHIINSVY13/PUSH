  "lyrics": "You shove your way\nThrough the room from the street\nAnd finally to me\nYou ask me what I'm drinking\nMy friend Johnny\nTugging on my sleeve\nAsks if I want to leave\nBut what I'm really thinking is\nWhy can't it be easy, easy?\nWhy don't you leave, leave me, leave me be?\nI can see you swaying\nI can't hear what you're saying\nI'm sitting here stuck\nAnd plastered to my seat\nI think up a reason to leave\nWhen you finally stop speaking\nI'll take a long slow walk\nDown Washington Street\nHalf-asleep on my feet\nHalf-aware if I'm dreaming\nI'll go home alone\nA sinking stone\nA switched-off telephone\nI'll go on and be free\nA frozen breeze\nA fallen-down factory\nBut I still see you swaying\nAnd I can't hear what you're saying\n\nI just lost the plot\nGot a little caught\nIn a little knot\nI just hit a wall\nHad a little fall\nFelt the swinging wrecking ball\nAnd why should that be?\nWhy don't you tell me?\nWhy don't you tell me?\nI'm sure you'll tell me\nWhy don't you tell me?\nI guess you'll tell me\nTell me"
