  "lyrics": "Broken windows and empty hallways\nA pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey\nHuman kindness is overflowing\nAnd I think it's gonna rain today\nScarecrows dressed in the latest styles\nThe frozen smiles to chase love away\nHuman kindness is overflowing\nAnd I think it's gonna rain today\nLonely, lonely\nA tin can at my feet\nI think I'll kick it down the street\nThat's the way to treat a friend\nBright before me the signs implore me\nHelp the needy and show them the way\nHuman kindness is overflowing\nAnd I think it's gonna rain today\nAnd I think it's gonna rain today"
