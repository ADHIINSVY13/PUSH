  "lyrics": "I've tried so hard, my dear, to show\nThat you're my every dream\nYet you're afraid each thing I do\nIs just some evil scheme\nA memory from your lonesome past\nKeeps us so far apart\nWhy can't I free your doubtful mind\nAnd melt your cold cold heart?\nAnother love before my time\nMade your heart sad and blue\nAnd so my heart is paying now\nFor things I didn't do\nIn anger, unkind words I said\nThat make the teardrops start\nWhy can't I free your doubtful mind\nAnd melt your cold cold heart?\nThere was a time when I believed\nThat you belonged to me\nBut now I know your heart is shackled\nTo a memory\nThe more I learn to care for you\nThe more we drift apart\nWhy can't I free your doubtful mind\nAnd melt your cold cold heart?"
