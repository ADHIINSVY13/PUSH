Flipping jobs, paying car notes?\nWhile I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke\nRight stroke, left stroke was the best stroke\nDeath stroke, tongue all down her throat\nNothing left to do but send her home to you\nI'm through, can you sing the song for me, boo?\n[Chorus: Faith Evans & \nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n]\nOne more chance (One more chance)\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love, girl, you didn't know?\n Give me one more chance)\nOne more chance\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love, girl, you didn't know?\n)\nOne more chance\n\n[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nSo what's it gonna be, him or me?\nWe can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls\nThe envy of all women, crushed linen\nCartier wristwear with diamonds in 'em\nThe finest women I love with a passion\nYour man's a wimp, I give that **** a good thrashin'\nHigh fashion, flying into all states\nSexing me while your man ****\nIsn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight\nHer flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds\nLyrically, I'm supposed to represent\nI'm not only a client, I'm the player president\n[Chorus: Faith Evans & \nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n]\nOne more chance\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love girl, you didn't know?\n One more chance)\nOne more chance (Baby, here I am)\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love girl, you didn't know?\n)\nAll I need is one more chance\n[Outro: Faith Evans, \nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n & \nPuff Daddy\n]\nOne more chance (\n'95\n)\nI can help you find yourself (\nI got that good love girl, you didn't know?\n)\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love girl, you didn't know?\n)\n'Cause you don't need nobody else (\nBad Boy, Bad Boy\n)\nOne more chance (Baby, here I am)\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love girl, you didn't know?\n \nEast Coast\n)\nAll I need is one more chance (\nWest Coast\n)\nOne more chance\nI can help you find yourself (\nRock on\n)\nBiggie, give me one more chance (\nI got that good love girl, you didn't know?\n)\n'Cause you don't need nobody else"
