  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOn the first page of our story\nThe future seemed so bright\nThen this thing turned out so evil\nDon't know why I'm still surprised\nEven angels have their wicked schemes\nAnd you take that to new extremes\nBut you'll always be my hero\nEven though you've lost your mind\n[Chorus]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie\nOhh yeah\n[Verse 2]\nNow there's gravel in our voices\nGlass is shattered from the fight\nIn this tug of war you'll always win\nEven when I'm right\nCause you feed me fables from your hands\nWith violent words and empty threats\nAnd it's sick that all these battles\nAre what keeps me satisfied\n\n[Chorus]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie\n[Bridge]\nSo maybe I'm a masochist\nI try to run but I don't wanna ever leave\nTill these walls are going up\nIn smoke with all our memories\n[Chorus]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nBut that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nOh, I love the way you lie"
