  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've had a week from hell, I don't know how it started\nLike a rollercoaster that never seems to end\nLike a rain cloud above my shoulders\nOh, it feels like the weight is pouring down\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan anybody hear me, hear me, hear me now?\nCan anybody see the path life chose somehow?\nCan somebody just hold me in their arms tonight?\n'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be\n[Chorus]\nThat girl at the party drinking alone\nThat girl at the party who just won't go home\nChasing boys, chasing dreams, so frustrated by reality\nI don't wanna be, I don't wanna be that girl at the party\n[Verse 2]\nI try my best, but I just can't get permission\nNever could enough 'cause there's never a room for two\nAnd sometimes my tears feel like a waterfall\nBut I guess to you, they don't mean a thing at all\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan anybody hear me, hear me, hear me now?\nCan anybody see the path life chose somehow?\nCan somebody just hold me in their arms tonight?\n'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be\n\n[Chorus]\nThat girl at the party drinking alone\nThat girl at the party who just won't go home\nChasing boys, chasing dreams, so frustrated by reality\nI don't wanna be, I don't wanna be\n[Bridge]\nOh, room spinning\nI don't feel ain't no place for me\nI don't wanna be\nNo, I don't wanna be\n[Chorus]\nThat girl at the party drinking alone\nThat girl at the party who just won't go home\nChasing boys, chasing dreams, so frustrated by reality\nI don't wanna be, I don't wanna be\nThat girl at the party drinking alone\nThat girl at the party who just won't go home\nChasing boys, chasing dreams, so frustrated by reality\nI don't wanna be, I don't wanna be that girl at the party"
