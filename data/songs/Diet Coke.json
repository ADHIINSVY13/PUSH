Me and Yezos\nWash, then dry, so give me all of mine in pesos\nAdd it up (Add it up)\nYour bitches in them pictures but they laser taggin' us\nThey mad at us, who wouldn't be?\nWe became everything you couldn't be\nEverything your mama said you shouldn't be\nThe Porsche's horses revvin', like, \"Look at me\"\nSaddle up\nI'm still pitchin', baby, batter up\n\n[Chorus]\nImaginary players ain't been coached right\nMaster recipes under stove lights\nThe number on this jersey is the quote price\nYou ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?\nAll you niggas get it off the boat, right?\nBut only I can really have a snow fight\nDetroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?\nIf your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life\n[Verse 2]\nThe flow's untouched, the drums is tucked\nDrive Cullinan when roads get rough\nSnow’s a must, the nose adjust\nYoung Gs like we Hov and Puff\nBest jewelries and hoes we lust\nChanel trinkets and hoes'll blush\nCrush hearts like pretty boys\nAnd we drivin' pretty toys\nExtendos will make plenty noise\nCrescendo make your car endo\nPierce your car window\nMissy was our only misdemeanor\nNike box hold a hundred thou' with no insoles, uh\nThe crack era was such a Black era\nHow many still standin' reflectin' in that mirror?\nLucky me\n\n[Chorus]\nImaginary players ain't been coached right\nMaster recipes under stove lights\nThe number on this jersey is the quote price\nYou ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?\nAll you niggas get it off the boat, right?\nBut only I can really have a snow fight\nDetroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?\nIf your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life"
