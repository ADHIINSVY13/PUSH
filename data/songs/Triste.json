  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSad is to live in solitude\nFar from your tranquil altitude\nSad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream\nThat never can be, will never be\nDreamer awake, wake up and see\n[Verse 2]\nYour beauty is an aeroplane\nSo high my heart can't bear the strain\nA heart that stops when you pass by\nOnly to cause me pain\nSad is to live in solitude\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 2]\nYour beauty is an aeroplane\nSo high my heart can't bear the strain\nA heart that stops when you pass by\nOnly to cause me pain\nSad is to live in solitude"
