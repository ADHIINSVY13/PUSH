  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOh, it's carnival night\nAnd they're stringing the lights around you\nHanging paper angels\nPainting little devils on the roof\nOh the furnace wind\nIs a flickering of wings about your face\nIn a cloud of incense\nYea, it smells like Heaven in this place\n[Chorus 1]\nI can't eat, can't sleep\nStill I hunger for you when you look at me\nThat face, those eyes\nAll the sinful pleasures deep inside\n[Chorus 2]\nTell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in\nUnderneath my skin\nOh you were always my original sin\nAnd tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin\nThis dangerous game\nOh you were always my original sin\n[Verse 2]\nA dream will fly\nThe moment that you open up your eyes\nA dream is just a riddle\nGhosts from every corner of your life\nUp in the balcony\nAll the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand\nBlowing theater kisses\nReciting lines they don't understand\n\n[Chorus 1]\n[Chorus 2]\n[Chorus 1]"
