Aida!\nAll we ask of you\nIs a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage\nTo ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do\nAida! Aida!\n[NEHEBKA]\nYour robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect\nInstead of this ragged concoction of thread\nBut may you be moved by its desperate beauty\nTo give us new life, for we'd rather be dead\nThen live in the squalor and shame of the slave\nTo the dance!\n[NUBIANS]\nAida! Aida!\nAll we ask of you\nIs a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage\nTo ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do\nAida! Aida!\n\nAida...!\nAida! Aida!\nAida! Aida!\nAida!\n[AIDA]\nI know expectations are wild and almost\nBeyond my fulfillment, but they won't hear\nA word of a doubt or see signs of a weakness\nMy nigh-on-impossible duty is clear\nAnd if I can rekindle our ancestors' dreams, it's enough\nIt's enough\n[NUBIANS]\nAida! Aida! Aida!\nAida! Aida! Aida!\n[AIDA]\nIt's enough!\n[NUBIANS]\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah..."
