  "lyrics": "From the Get Rich or Die Tryin soundtrack. “What If” shows 50 dreamin about what would happen if he got rich and famous and how people, especially in the hood, would react to his decisions.\n[Intro]\nYeah, I'm fuckin' with this\nIt's that classic shit, that gangsta shit, yeah\n[Chorus]\nMan I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?\nMan I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin' what if?\nHomie I play the block tryin' to get my packs off - sayin' what if?\nMan if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?\n[Verse 1]\nIf I got on some pretty boy shit like Puffy\nNiggas in the hood, man they just wouldn't love me\nIf I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z\nNiggas would think I bump my fuckin' head and went crazy\nIf I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby\nI wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady\nIf I put out bullshit joints like AZ\nEvery chance niggas get, they'd try and play me\nBut I move around with a little .380\nA nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B\nIf I smoked weed all day like Snoop do\nI'd see the world different through my dilated pupils\nIf I bust dance moves on you like Usher\nNiggas'll say \"50 that ain't gangsta, fuck ya\"\nMan I'ma just keep doin' what I do\nCause niggas can't do me, better than I do, ha ha\n\n[Chorus]\nMan I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?\nMan I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin' what if?\nHomie I play the block tryin' to get my packs off - sayin' what if?\nMan if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?\n[Verse 2]\nWhat if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith?\nAnd all the backpack niggas loved me like Mos Def\nI'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube\nPicture me in this flick right now lookin' so cool\nWhat if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?\nHustle to keep a homie 'round, somebody to hold the gat\nMan what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?\nShit I'd give that child support up with no problems\nIf I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught\nCause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York\nBut if I was the new rap nigga you didn't know\nYou'd be sayin' \"Damn that kid got a sick flow\"\nWhat if I just cruised through your hood on 22's\nBumpin' Curtis Mayfield or Marvin, somethin' smooth\nAnd if I let the top down on the Azure\nYeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha ha\n[Chorus]\nMan I watched the sun go up but come down - sayin' what if?\nMan I watched the tide roll in and roll out - sayin' what if?\nHomey I play the block tryin' to get my packs off - sayin' what if?\nMan if I get a shot, I could make it to the top - damn what if?"
