(Soul...)\n(Ah ah ah ah...) \nI got it... I got it, shawty, yeah (It's our ball! Uh!)\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ya\n[Verse 2: Khujo]\nI tackle my problems, never run from my foes\nStiff-arm facemask, hit the juke button, then leave a sucka froze\nLike he just tried to shove a whole ki' up in his nose\nOh naw, folks (Fo'!) – you hit 'em high, I hit 'em low, for this dough\nYour heart gon' bust out here, 'cause we comin' full speed\nWith the intent to lift you up off of your feet\nAt the lift, of the glass, sippin' victory\nClean cut, but I stay dirty\nUhh – you play fair, I cheat\nI spike this pig in yo' face, like you never stopped eatin' pork or beef\nEnd diseases and careers\nTenacious on this gridiron, All-Pro Hall of Famer, with no fears\nBlood, sweat, and tears! (Ohhh!)\n\n[Interlude: André 3000]\nSo... (Ah...) yeah... (Ah ah ah ah...) yeah...\nSunday, yeah... yeah...\n[Hook: André 3000]\nSunday mornin'\nMakes me feel (Ah ah ah ah ah...)\nSo godly\nPardon me, if I shake your soul... (Ah ah ah ah ah...)\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ya\n[Verse 3: André 3000]\nThe rich boy got that bag 'cause he is rich\nThe poor boy gotta bag 'cause he is poor\nThe bad boy got it bad 'cause he want both\nThe good girl got it good 'cause she got game\nAnd runs it on undeveloped fellas considered lame\nSame like mechanics do it, baby who need her Buick\nRepaired, don't have no knowledge of what a brake shoe is\nMake woo-ood turn to nickle, squirm and tickle\nWe wiggle out your emotions like a dill pickle\nIn autumn, fall, into the bottom of black holes\nMake a left on nothingness 'cause that's where I'm at\nCold as summer; I got yo' number, you got my number\nLet's add 'em, see what we come with, maybe we could slumber, like uh, Babies and bums, and–retarded ones, uh\nDolphins and whales–are the smartest ones, so\nNothing you can do can be new up under the sun\nDepending what sun you live under, you can be the one on\n\n[Hook: André 3000, \nBig Boi\n]\nSunday mornin'\nMakes me feel (Ha ha ha ha...)\nSo godly\nPardon me, if I shake your soul... (Soul...)\n(Ah ah ah ah ah ah...) \nYeah...\n(Ah ah ah ah ah...) Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ya\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nAin't no Sunday School this morning\nThey say somebody blowed up the church\nWhat's even worse than that, I heard Pastor Jenkins, he got hurt\nBy the perpetrators, demonstrators of violence and hatred\nIt's fin' to be 2001, the rojo-necks are racist\nFascists acting savage on the Sabbath, must be demons\nErrand boys for Satan, defeated\nWhen I repeated \"Rebuke thee, rebuke thee\"\nThe look in they eye was spooky\nBut now I find myself in the park, sittin' in my hooptie\nLike a movie, I was daydreamin' and everything seemed real\nBut now I'm at Mozley Park and we got some chicken on the grill\nGet a beer, nigga, chill\nRoll a junt, pop a pill, cop a feel from some cut, as we do it like this here, on\n[Bridge]\nOn any given Sunday\nAh – A legend will be born\nA tradition will be broken\nAh – \nvictory is yours\nOn any given Sunday\n\n[Hook: André 3000]\nSunday mornin'\nMakes me feel (Ah ah ah ah...)\nSo godly\nPardon me, if I shake your soul...\n(Ah ah ah ah ah...)\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ya (ya...ya...ya...ya....)"
