  "lyrics": "To dream the impossible dream\nTo fight the unbeatable foe\nTo bear with unbearable sorrow\nTo run where the brave dare not go\nTo right the unrightable wrong\n(*)To be better far than you are(*)\nTo try when your arms are too weary\nTo reach the unreachable star\nThis is my quest, to follow that star\nNo matter how hopeless, no matter how far\n(**)To be willing to give when there's no more to give (**)\n(***)To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live (***)\nAnd I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest\nThat my heart will lie peaceful and calm when I'm laid to my rest\nAnd the world will be better for this\nThat one man, scorned and covered with scars\nStill strove with his last ounce of courage\nTo reach the unreachable star"
