  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe smoke cloud billows out his mouth\nLike a freight train through a small town\nThe jokes that he told across the bar\nWere revolting and far too loud\n[Chorus]\nThey shake their heads sayin', \"God, help her\"\nWhen I tell 'em he's my man\nBut your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger\nI can fix him, no, really, I can\nAnd only I can\n[Verse 2]\nThe dopamine races through his brain\nOn a six-lane Texas highway\nHis hand so calloused from his pistol\nSoftly traces hearts on my face\nAnd I could see it from a mile away\nA perfect case for my certain skill set\nHe had a halo of the highest gradе\nHe just hadn't met me yеt\n[Chorus]\nThey shake their heads sayin', \"God, help her\"\nWhen I tell 'em he's my man\nBut your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger\nI can fix him, no, really, I can\nAnd only I can\n\n[Bridge]\nGood boy, that's right, come close\nI'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night\nTrust me, I can handle me a dangerous man\nNo, really, I can\n[Chorus]\nThey shook their heads sayin', \"God, help her\"\nWhen I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)\nBut your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger\nI can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)\nWoah, maybe I can't"
