  "lyrics": "As I awoke this evening\nWith the smell of woodsmoke clinging\nLike a gentle cobweb hanging\nUpon a painted tepee\nOh, I went to see my chieftain\nWith my warlance and my woman\nFor he told us that the yellow moon\nWould very soon be leaving\nThis I can't believe I said\nI can't believe our Warlord's dead\nOh, he would not leave the chosen ones\nTo the buzzards and the soldiers' guns\nOh, great father of the \nIroquois\nEver since I was young\nI've read the writing of the smoke\nAnd breast-fed on the sound of drums\nI've learned to hurl the tomahawk\nAnd ride a painted pony wild\nTo run the gauntlet of the Sioux\nTo make a chieftain's daughter mine\nAnd now you ask that I should watch\nThe red man's race be slowly crushed?\nWhat kind of words are these to hear\nFrom Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?\n\nI take only what is mine, Lord\nMy pony, my squaw, and my child\nI can't stay to see you die\nAlong with my tribe's pride\nI go to search for the yellow moon\nAnd the fathers of our sons\nWhere the red sun sinks in the hills of gold\nAnd the healing waters run\nTrampling down the prairie rose\nLeaving hoof tracks in the sand\nThose who wish to follow me\nI welcome with my hands\nI heard from passing renegades\nGeronimo was dead\nHe'd been laying down his weapons\nWhen they filled him full of lead\nNow there seems no reason why\nI should carry on\nIn this land that once was my land\nI can't find a home\nIt's lonely and it's quiet\nAnd the horse soldiers are coming\nAnd I think it's time I strung my bow\nAnd ceased my senseless running\nFor soon I'll find the yellow moon\nAlong with my loved ones\nWhere the buffaloes graze in clover fields\nWithout the sound of guns\nAnd the red sun sinks at last\nInto the hills of gold\nAnd peace to this young warrior\nComes with a bullet hole"
