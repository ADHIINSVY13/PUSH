  "lyrics": "I won't believe it's Christmas\nTill you make it home to me\nThe snow isn't white, the stars aren't bright\nAnd lights don't belong on the tree\nI will stay up all night waiting\nFor you on Christmas Eve\nThe sleigh bells won't ring\nBing Crosby won't sing\nIt's not Christmas till you come home\nI won't believe it's Christmas\nTill you walk through that door\nThere's no Tiny Tim and Santa is slim\nAnd mistletoe's hung on the floor\nI made a promise to you\nTo wait for your return\nThe snowflakes won't fall\nWe can't deck the halls\nIt's not Christmas till you come home\nThe snowflakes won't fall\nWe can't deck the halls\nIt's not Christmas till you come home"
