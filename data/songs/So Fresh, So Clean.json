Ah\nTeddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm\nLeft her throat warm, in the dorm room at the AU\nWe blew hay too,\n \nathletes might cake you\nBut you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause–\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & \nRico Wade\n]\nAin't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean\nSo fresh and so clean, clean\nDon't you think I'm so sexy?
