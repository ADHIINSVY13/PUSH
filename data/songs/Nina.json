(Ooh-ah)\n[Chorus]\nOh, Nina\nYou should go, Nina (Mmm)\n(Love will come and love will go)\n'Cause I ain't ever comin' home, Nina\n(But you can make it on your own)\nOh, won't you leave me now?\n(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)\nAnd I've been livin' on the road, Nina (Oh)\n(People grow and fall apart)\nBut then again, you should know, Nina\n(But you can't mend your broken heart)\n'Cause that's you and me both, Nina\n(Take it back, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\nOh, Nina\nYou should go, Nina\n(Love will come and love will go)\n'Cause I ain't never comin' home, Nina\n(But you can make it on your own)\nOh, won't you leave me now?\n(Sing that song, go, oh, won't you leave me now?)\nAnd I've been livin' on the road, Nina (I've been livin' on the road)\n(People grow and fall apart)\nBut then again, you should know, Nina (But then again, you should know)\n(But you can mend your broken heart)\n'Cause that's you and me both, Nina (That's you and me both, Nina)\nOh, won't you leave me now, now?\n\n[Produced by Jake Gosling]"
