  "lyrics": "[Louis]\nWhere is the glory in this new me?\nWhere is the feeling of achievement\nIn the shadows of the evening?\nWhere is the satisfaction in your killing creed?\nWho am I now, I don't know\nI trust in my existence\nAnd deal with your persistence\nAnd somehow, some way, you set me free\nAnd I don't think that I can take another night\nOf these instincts that I fight\nThis overwhelming dread\nOf feeling damned inside\n[Lestat]\nOh god help us, just look at you\nShrinking away from my point of view!\nShowering me with your pious blamе\nThe gift that I gave is exеmpt from shame\nEmbrace it\nEmbrace it\nIt makes no sense without the strength to push your grief aside\nThis pleasure you deny\n\nEmbrace it\nEmbrace it\n[Louis]\nYou seek my trust after your lies\nWell, in this superficial splendor\nThe decades will seem endless\nAnd will the drudgery of torment be my bride?\n[Lestat]\nWhat lies of these are which you speak?\nAre you so blinded by contrition\nThat you see, in my position\nA failure to practice what I preach?\nI don't think that I can take another night\nOf your craving for the light\nThis wilted flower act\nThat questions wrong from right\n[Louis]\nOh god help me, just look at you\nStriding through hell with nothing to prove\nA glorious ghost on infinity's views\nThen if it's to be, tell me, what should I do?\n\n[Lestat]\nEmbrace it\nEmbrace it!\n[Louis]\nHow can it be that you achieved\nThis condition with such ease?\nThere's none of you in me\n[Lestat]\nEmbrace it\nEmbrace it\n[Lestat & Louis]\nSo god help us to see it through\nTwo of Lucifer's angels are on the loose\n[Lestat]\nOh merciful and majestic boy\nThe gift I bestowed is to be enjoyed\nEmbrace it\nEmbrace it\n[Louis]\nWhat should I do with the likes of you\nYour wild and reckless ways\nYour cunning to persuade\n\n[Lestat]\nEmbrace it\nEmbrace it"
