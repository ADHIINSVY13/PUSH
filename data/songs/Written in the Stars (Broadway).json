You can help my people, this could be our chance to do something important!  Don't you see?\n\n(sung)\nNothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide\nNo escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide\n[RADAMES]\nYou are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied\nSometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned\n[BOTH]\nWhat it is to be in love and have that love returned\n[AIDA]\nIs it written in the stars\nAre we paying for some crime\nIs that all that we are good for\nJust a stretch of mortal time\n[BOTH]\nOr some god's experiment\nIn which we have no say\nIn which we're given paradise\nBut only for a day"
