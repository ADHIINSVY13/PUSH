  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIf you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants\nAnd life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you\nThe best and the worse things in life come free\nBut you can think of me as your best guarantee\nIt's true, I'm here for you\nAnd if you just breathed your last breath\nI'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left\nI'd never let you go\nIf you were on the edge of a bridge\nI'd push you to live\nI'm your parachute, don't you ever forget\nAnd if you get the chance to return the gift\n[Chorus]\nPromise me you'll save someone\nIf you can, if you can\nSave someone\nUnderstand, understand\nSome have been chosen to wake up the broken\nSo promise you won't turn away\nOh, save someone\n[Verse 2]\nLike a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night\nI'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you\nI'd fight for you\nWhen you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays\nI'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear\nAnd if you get the chance to return the gift\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise me you'll save someone\nIf you can, if you can\nSave someone\nUnderstand, understand\nSome have been chosen to wake up the broken\nSo promise you won't turn away\nOh, save someone\n[Bridge]\nWhen you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you\nWhen you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you\nI know you got so much strength inside\nIf I ask you would you save me tonight?\n[Chorus]\nPromise me you'll save someone\nIf you can, if you can\nSave someone\nUnderstand, understand\nSome have been chosen to wake up the broken\nSo promise you won't turn away\nOh, save someone"
