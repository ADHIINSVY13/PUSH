  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI spy with my little tired eye\nTiny as a firefly\nA pebble that we picked up last July\nDown deep inside your pocket\nWe almost forgot it\nDoes it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?\nOoh, ooh\n[Chorus]\nThey said the end is comin'\nEveryone’s up to somethin'\nI find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings\nOutside, they’re push and shovin'\nYou're in the kitchen hummin'\nAll that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'\n[Verse 2]\nOn the way home\nI wrote a poem\nYou say, \"What a mind\"\nThis happens all the time\nOoh, ooh\n[Chorus]\n'Causе they said the end is comin'\nEvеryone's up to somethin’\nI find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings\nOutside, they're push and shovin’\nYou're in the kitchen hummin'\nAll that you ever wanted from me was nothin'\n\n[Bridge]\nIndustry disruptors and soul deconstructors\nAnd smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other\nAnd the voices that implore, \"You should be doing more\"\nTo you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it\nOoh\n[Chorus]\nThey said the end is comin'\nEveryone's up to somethin'\nI find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings\nOutside, they're push and shovin'\nYou're in the kitchen hummin'\nAll that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'\nThey said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')\nEveryone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')\nI find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings\nOutside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')\nYou're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')\nAll that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'"
