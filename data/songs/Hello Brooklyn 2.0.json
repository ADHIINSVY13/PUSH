Brooklyn Carter\nWhen I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you\n'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner\nAnd I'm eating, so much, I bought extra\nSo much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast\nI only roll Lexus to hug your road\nI love your corners,\n \nI'm half your soul\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne & \nLil Wayne & Jay-Z\n]\nHello, Brooklyn\n, how you doing?\nWhere you going? Can I come too?\nAnd If I can, I'ma be your man\nYou could be my lady and have my baby\nAnd drive my cars, and drive me crazy\nWherever you going, baby girl, just take me\n'Cause I'm so taken if you taken\nI'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nHello, Brooklyn, what's your story?\nShe said she eating on the run, but she ain't Nore'\nShe said she got a man but he ain't worried\nBut baby, I'ma have to rob him like Horry\nShe said she love B.I.G., and she like 2Pac\nAnd when I said Jay-Z, she say, \"It's the Roc!\"\nAnd I'ma leave it like this—like this, like that\nWhere Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?\nHave you seen her?\nAnd when she tell you something, you better believe her\nShe told me she like my New Orleans demeanor\nAnd so, I said, \"Goodbye, Katrina\"\n[Bridge: Lil Wayne & \nJay-Z\n]\nAnd \"Hello, Brooklyn!\" Buh-baby, you are\nThe sweetest sight eyes could see\nI said, \"Hello, Brooklyn!\" Buh-baby\nI hope you never say goodbye to me\nI said, \"Hello, Brooklyn!\" Buh-buh-baby, you are (\nWoo!\n)\nSo damn fine to me\nAnd I remember the time (\nTime\n), place (\nPlace\n)\nAnd the weather (\nAnd, woo!\n)\nOn the day you said, \"Hi,\" to me\nAnd I say, \"Hello, Brooklyn!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nBrooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me\nRazor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving—\nAll demented; black hoodies and Timberland-ed\nAlways scheming—\"You see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?\"\n(Hello, Brooklyn) You bad influence, look what you had me doing\nBut I ain't mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude\nIt says my life's too real, check out my ice grill\nBaby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville\nBut my Bed's in the Stuy,\n \nthough I'll lie flat in your bush\n'Til we smoke a C.I.,\n \n\"What up\" to the boy, B.I.?\nYou know I handle B-I,\n \nI don't half-step on the 'caine\nAsk the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan 'so?\nShe like it hardcore, so I grind slow\nIller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0\nMy fine ho, we got some victims to catch\nSo in a couple years, baby, I'ma bring you some Nets (Woo!)\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nHello, Brooklyn, how you doing? (Yeah)\nWhere you going? Can I come too?\nAnd If I can, I'ma be your man\nYou could be my lady, and have my baby\nAnd drive my cars (Errr!), and drive me crazy (Errr!)\nWherever you goin' baby girl, just take me\n'Cause I'm so taken if you taken\nI'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying (Yeah)\n\n[Bridge: Lil Wayne]\nAnd hello, Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby, you are\nThe sweetest thing eyes could see\nHello, Brooklyn\nBaby, I hope you never say goodbye to me\nI said, \"Hello, Brooklyn,\" buh-baby you are\nSo damn fine to me\nBut I remember the time, place, and the weather\nOn the day she said hi to me\nAnd I said, \"Hello, Brooklyn\""
