  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStart spreading the news, I'm leaving today\nI want to be a part of it: New York, New York\nThese vagabond shoes are longing to stray\nRight through the very heart of it: New York, New York\n[Hook]\nI wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep\nAnd find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap\n[Verse 2]\nThese little town blues are melting away\nI'll make a brand new start of it in old New York\n[Hook]\nIf I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere\nIt's up to you, New York, New York\n[Verse 3]\nNew York, New York\nI want to wake up in a city that never sleeps\nAnd find I'm a number one, top of the list\nKing of the hill, a number one\n[Outro]\nThese little town blues are melting away\nI'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York\nAnd if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere\nIt's up to you, New York, New York"
