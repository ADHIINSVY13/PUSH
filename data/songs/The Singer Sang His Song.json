  "lyrics": "He'd sing his song most every night\nWishing she was there behind the light\nThe people danced and sang along\nOn the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong\nAnd the piper played the tune\nAnd the drummer won his spurs\nBut the song that the singer sang was for her\nNow the singer's song is never heard\nAnd the visions he once saw are disappeared\nNow they never dance or sing along\nBut on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong\nAnd the piper played the tune\nAnd the drummer won his spurs\nBut the song that the singer sang was for her\nAhaha..."
