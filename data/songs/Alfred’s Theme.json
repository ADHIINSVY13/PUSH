Hold on, wait\n\"I'm Diddy's side bitch?\"\nOh, I'm still east side, bitch\n[Verse 3]\nSo 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD\nBeen givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)\nFrom the \nMMLP\n to (Huh?) \nMTBMB\n (Bitch)\nBitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)\nSo call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)\n'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall\nGot your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)\nThrough a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)\nMy dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)\nI'm so far past the bar, I should practice law\nMentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)\nDukes of Hazzard\n car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs\n'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked\nThis music 'bout to kill you, \nbrr, brr (Brr)\nThis chicken hit my phone, she said, \"Chirp, chirp\"\nI said, \"Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt\"\nThen go eat some worms, like the early bird\nWhat the fuck is love? That's a dirty word\nMake me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth\nOr any other planet, that's a world of hurt\nAnd I won't buy her designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)\nBut I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)\nAnd this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)\nOr they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)\nYeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark\nAt Walmart with a small cart buying wall art\nAnd y'all who claim to be dogs aren't\nNo bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf\nBut y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)\nAnd I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park\nI'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)\n'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when\nIt's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten\n'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again\nAnd when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)\nThe cypher begins\nI'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe\nIt's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin\nMy mind is a recycling bin\nThere's no place I never been\nBut I never budge and I never bend\nYou hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends\nLike adult diapers for men\nEven when I'm rappin' less stellar\nIt's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)\nLike a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth\nAnd go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route\nSo you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds\nYour ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you\nBut if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter\n'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)\nSo you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap\nBitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)\nNo stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree\nBitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree\nYou never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea\nYou're always punkin' out like Halloween\nYou rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk\nHomie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump\nAnd you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump\nBitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk\nYeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to\nDisembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah\nThis is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome\n'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album\nSo I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer\nThe nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt\nI'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood\nIt's lookin' like it's that time of the month\nCarvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt\nI'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but\nY'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos\nI keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable\nStompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome\nSon 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo\nGot your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope\nYou out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole\n\n[Outro]\nWait, why'd the beat cut off?\nFuck it"
