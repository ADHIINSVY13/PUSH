You're down and out, my friend\nDown and out again! Down and out again!\nDown and out again but I'm down with you\n[Chorus]\nOne more time for the last time! (\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n)\nOne more time for release! (\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n)\nOne more time for the last time! (\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n)\nEveryone wants to believe! (\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n)\n[Outro]\nOne more time for the last time! One more time for release!\nOne more time for the last time! Everyone wants to believe!\nOne more time for the last time! One more time for release!\nOne more time for the very last time! Everyone wants to believe, alright!"
