  "lyrics": "How insensitive I must have seemed\nWhen she told me that she loved me\nHow unmoved and cold\nI must have seemed\nWhen she told me so sincerely\nWhy she must have asked\nDid I just turn and stare in icy silence\nWhat was I to say\nWhat can you say when a love affair is over\nNow she's gone away\nAnd I'm alone with the memory of her last look\nVague and drawn and sad\nI see it still\nAll her heartbreak in that last look\nAh, porque você\nFoi fraco assim\nAssim tão desalmado\nWhat was I to do\nWhat can one do when a love affair is over"
