  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAll is fair in love\nLove's a crazy game\nTwo people vow to stay\nIn love as one they say\nBut all is changed with time\nThe future none can see\nThe road you leave behind\nAhead lies mystery\n[Chorus]\nBut all is fair in love\nI had to go away\nA writer takes his pen\nTo write the words again\nThat all in love is fair\n[Verse 2]\nAll of fate's a chance\nIt's either good or bad\nI tossed my coin to say\nIn love with me you'd stay\nBut all in war is so cold\nYou either win or lose\nWhen all is put away\nThe losing side I'll play\n[Chorus]\nBut all is fair in love\nI should never have left your side\nA writer takes his pen\nTo write the words again\nThat all in love is fair\n[Outro]\nA writer takes his pen\nTo write the words again\nThat all in love is fair"
