  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, ain't it a shame\n'bout our short little memory?\nNever seem to learn\nThe lessons of history\nWe keep making the same mistakes\nOver and over and over and over again\nAnd then we wonder why\nWe're in the shape we're in\nGood old boys down at the bar\nPeanuts and politics\nThey think they know it all\nThey don't know much of nothing\nEven if one of them was to read a newspaper\nCover-to-cover\nThat ain't what's going on\nJournalism dead and gone\n[Chorus]\nFrail grasp on the big picture\nLight fading and the fog is getting thicker\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\nDark ages\n[Verse 2]\nYou, my love-drunk friend\nAll that red wine and candlelight\nSoulful conversations\nThat go on until the dawn\nHow many times can you tell your story?\nHow many hangovers can you endure\nJust to get some snuggling done?\n\nYou're living in a hormone dream\nYou don't have the slightest notion\nWhat long-term love is all about\nAll your romantic liaisons\nDon't deal with eternal questions like\n\"Who left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?\"\n\"Whose turn to take the garbage out?\"\n[Chorus]\nFrail grasp on the big picture\nYou keep on rubbing and you're gonna get a blister\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\nAnd I've seen it all before\n[Bridge]\nAnd we pray to our Lord\nWho we know is American\nHe reigns from on high\nHe speaks to us through middlemen\nAnd he shepherds his flock\nWe sing out and we praise His name\nHe supports us in war\nHe presides over football games\nAnd the right will prevail\nAll our troubles shall be resolved\nWe have faith above all\nUnless there's money or sex involved\n\n[Chorus]\nFrail grasp on the big picture (Nobody)\nNobody's calling and they're roughing up the kicker\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\nHeaven help us\nFrail grasp on the big picture\nAll waiting for that miracle elixir\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\nI don't wonder anymore\nFrail grasp on the big picture (Somebody)\nYou brought her here so go ahead and kiss her\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\nFrail grasp on the big picture (Hold on, hold on)\nLight fading and the fog is getting thicker\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\n[Outro]\nFrail grasp on the big picture\nFrail grasp on the big picture"
