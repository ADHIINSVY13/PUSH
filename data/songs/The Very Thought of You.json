  "lyrics": "The very thought of you\nAnd I forget to do\nThe little ordinary things\nEveryone ought to do\nI'm living in a kind of daydream\nI'm happy as a queen\nBut foolish though it may seem\nTo me that's everything\nThe mere idea of you\nThe longing here for you\nYou never know how slow the moments go\nOh, until I'm near here to you\nI see your face in every flower\nYour eyes in the stars above\nIt's just the thought of you\nThe very thought of you, my love\nThe mere idea of you\nThe longing here for you\nYou never know how slow the moments go\nOh, until I'm near here to you babe\nI see your face in every flower\nYour eyes, your eyes in the stars above\nIt's just the thought of you\nThe very thought of you, my love\n\nIt's just the thought of you, babe\nThe very thought of you, my, my love"
