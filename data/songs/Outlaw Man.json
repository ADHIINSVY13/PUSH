  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son\nThe highway is my legacy, on the highway I will run\nIn one hand I've a Bible, in the other I've got a gun\nWell, don't you know me? I'm the man who won\n[Chorus]\nWoman, don't try to love me, don't try to understand\nA life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man\n[Verse 2]\nFirst left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe\nHeaded for Oklahoma, I was riding night and day\nAll of my friends are strangers, they quickly come and go\nAnd all my love's in danger 'cause I steal hearts and souls\n[Chorus]\nWoman, don't try to love me, don't try to understand\nA life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nWoman, don't try to love me, don't try to understand\nA life upon the road is the life of an outlaw\n\n[Bridge]\nSome men call me Abel, some men call me Cain\nSome men call me Sinner, Lord, and some men call me Saint\nSome say there's a Jesus, some men say there ain't\nWhen you got no life to lose, then there's nothing left to gain\n[Outro]\nOutlaw man\nOutlaw man"
