  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, the night is young\nAnd the stars are out\nAnd your eyes are all aglow\nAnd you say you feel\nWays you've never felt\nBut are you sure? Make sure you're sure\n[Verse 2]\nWell, the wine is sweet\nAnd the music sways\nAnd your lips are so divine\nAnd you say you know\nThat you're falling in love\nNow, let's be mature, make sure you're sure\n[Bridge]\nI'm not accustomed to wearing my feelings\nIn a place that's so obvious to see\nBut if eyes don't lie\nThere's a chance that you are not fooling yourself and me\n[Verse 3]\nWell, the night is through\nAnd the sun's come out\nAnd so too has your lovely smile\nAnd you vow to stay\nIn these arms always\nCan you endure? Now are you sure?\n\n[Outro]\nLove can be so insecure\nSo please be sure"
