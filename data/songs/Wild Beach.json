In the wild now\n[Chorus]\nWild beach\nCan't control these wild things\nCan't you see you're drowning?\nTryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach\nIt's like you're tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach\nI'm a wild beach, I'm a wild beach\n[Verse 2]\nBoy, you must be crazy\nMust be out of my mind\nFeel like I'm stranded but it go hand in hand\n'Cause we free to live that life\nNow see that though\nPretty in a drop top, we gon' blow\nPalm trees in a Backwood, he on both knees\nMake it pop-pop, I don't need no doors\nIf crib pop-itty, I don't need more hoes\nSee no evil even if she won't go\nDijon chico with the neon coat\nGot a vision of the sun, I just see more gold and\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWild out, make a name\nStars is out, freaky time\nSink the ship, take a dip\nCoconut, take a sip\nWildfire, dance around\nWear my gold like a crown\nWhere we've been, given doubt\nWhere we are? In the wild now\n[Chorus]\nWild beach\nCan't control these wild things\nCan't you see you're drowning?\nTryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach\nIt's like you're tryna tame a wild beast, I'm a wild beach\nI'm a wild beach, I'm a wild beach\n[Outro]\nEvery day it feels like the weekend\nEvery day could be summer season\nRelax your mind with me all weekend\nUnder jungle, roll in my leaves, yeah\nEvery day it feels like the weekend\nEvery day could be summer season\nRelax your mind with me all weekend\nUnder jungle, roll in my leaves, yeah\nMeow meow meow meow meow\nMeow meow meow meow meow meow meow\nMeow meow meow meow meow\nMeow meow meow meow meow\nMeow meow meow meow meow\nMeow meow meow meow meow meow meow\nMeow meow meow meow meow"
