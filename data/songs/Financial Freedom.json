Charged, direct sale\nThird shootout… we was fightin’ for positions\nShell casings out my 9 flyin’ through your mama kitchen\nPaper we stack it, pistols we pack it\nYou fuck around, we’ll blow your heart out the back of your jacket\nBitch, get down or lay down, my work is at Chach' crib\n‘Cause he got big, now he lieutenant so he sit there and watch\nI swear to God I think I had the same vision that Cat had\nWoke up sayin’ “we gon’ turn them corners to Baghdad”\nYeah, we was young, but we had guns, we started juxing niggas\nAll you hear is \nBoo-Boo\n fuckin’ with them Brooklyn niggas\nI had supreme schemes\n, \nCorley Wall thoughts\nStart shootin’, I bet I’ll clear off the ball court\nI want it all, that’s just how I fuckin’ feel, boy\nGet in the way, you gon' take your trip to Gilmores\n[Hook]\nI’m dreamin’ of…\nMy dream of freedom…\nFinancial freedom\n[Verse 2]\nConsist of big bags of bread and some coke, nigga\nYou can get with the program, fam’ll get smoked, nigga\nWe was a school of sharks -\n a bunch of young soldiers\nOpen your head when you’re half dead – you see? I told you\nOn the island, got that burner, got the flamethrower\nA couple niggas got blown, I got my name known\nOver the phones, soon as I’m home, the game’s sewn\nI got connections – look, bitch, I’m connected\nAnd I ain’t givin’ niggas no passes, so respect it\nOr get dealt with, I’ll break you off proper\nYou ready to die, huh? Too much Big Poppa\nEasy – nigga chill or get laid out\nI’ll put a hole in you then find out what your gang ‘bout\nI do my dirt, I’m hardly ever by my lonely\nI got that tech with that cooling system on me\nYou think you want it, you don't want it with me homie\n\n[Hook]\n[Verse 3]\nWe stackin’ paper ‘til we strong then we takin’ over\nGrab a gat, bring the crack back with baking soda\nBridge the gap, get slapped, actin’ like you know us\nNorth Pole, nah, Southside produce the colas\nWe’re the last of our litter, this is what they taught us\nWe’ve got to kill what we eat, that nigga came up on us\nIf you ain’t gamblin’, get the fuck out the spot, boy\nShoot an ace off your foot, that’s some shit you should get shot for\nFuck it, when I win I’m a winner – when I lose, I’m a winner\n‘Cause to my niggas y’all niggas lookin’ like steak dinner\nYou screw your face the fuck up, you gon' do what?\nThe strap big enough in my truck to chew your crew up\nNigga stand down or get manned down\nMack, two clips, 30 rounds plus 30 rounds, flip it around\nYou gon’ fuck around and get jammed up, blammed up\nHit your spine, a standup nigga can’t even stand up\n[Hook]"
