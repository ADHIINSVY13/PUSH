  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nFor you I was a flame\nLove is a losing game\nFive story fire as you came\nLove is a losing game\nOne I wish I never played\nOh what a mess we made\nAnd now the final frame\nLove is a losing game\nPlayed out by the band\nLove is a losing hand\nMore than I could stand\nLove is a losing hand\nSelf professed, profound\n'Til the chips were down\nKnow you're a gambling man\nLove is a losing hand\nAnd though I batted blind\nLove is a fate resigned\nMemories mar my mind\nLove is a fate resigned\nOver futile odds\nAnd laughed at by the gods\nAnd now the final frame\nLove is a losing game"
