  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI heard from a friend you'd been messing around\nWith a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown\nWell I don't know if I like that idea much\nWell you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough\nYou out of town guys sure think you're real keen\nThink all of us boys here are homespun and green\nBut that's wrong my friend so get this through your head\nWe're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red\n[Chorus]\nSo it's Ki yi yippie yi yi\nYou long hairs are sure gonna die\nOur American home was clean till you came\nAnd kids still respected the president's name\nAnd the eagle still flew in the sky\nHearts filled with national pride\nThen you came along with your drug-crazy songs\nGoddammit you're all gonna die\n[Verse 2]\nHow dare you sit there and drink all our beer\nOh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear\nThe minds of our daughters are poisoned by you\nWith your communistic politics and them negro blues\nWell I'm gonna quit talking and take action now\nRun all of you fairies clean out of this town\nOh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives\nSpending the summertime naturally high\n\n[Chorus]\nSo it's Ki yi yippie yi yi\nYou long hairs are sure gonna die\nOur American home was clean till you came\nAnd kids still respected the president's name\nAnd the eagle still flew in the sky\nHearts filled with national pride\nThen you came along with your drug-crazy songs\nGoddammit you're all gonna die\nGoddammit you're all gonna die\nOh Lord Goddammit you're all gonna die\nListen now"
