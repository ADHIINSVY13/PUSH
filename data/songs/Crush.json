  "lyrics": "“Crush” is a slow song about crushing on someone you consider to be a close friend, even though you think about sex with them.\n[Verse 1]\nI wanna line my walls with photographs you sent\nOf you lying in your swimsuit on the bed\nCan't live without your love inside me now\nI'll find a way to slip into your skin, somehow\n[Chorus]\nI wanna fuck your love slow\nCatch my heart, go swim\nFeel your lips crush\nHold you here, my loveliest friend\n[Instumental Bridge]\n[Verse 2]\nI love to watch you when you're trying on your clothes\nAnd now you're all I think about when I'm alone\nCan't wait to feel your love inside me now\nWe'll have a drink or two and we'll go to your house\n[Chorus]\nI wanna fuck your love slow\nCatch my heart, go swim\nFeel your lips crush\nHold you here, my loveliest friend\n\n[Instumental Bridge]\n[Chorus]\nI wanna fuck your love slow\nCatch my heart, go swim\nFeel your lips crush\nHold you here, my loveliest friend\n[Outro]\nCatch my heart, go swim\nFeel your lips crush\nHold you here my loveliest friend"
