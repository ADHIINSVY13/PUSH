Do you know my face?\nPerfect like a circle, gone without a trace\nSo long I have known you, marks upon your skin\nI can picture everything, can you picture this?\n[Refrain]\nSeda doesn't care, she just sits and stares\nAll her secrets there for the world to see\n[Verse 2]\nWho will stand before you if you don't say my name?\nSafe to say we will never know, we are both the same\nI don't mind, I can always find you waiting there for me\n[Refrain]\nSeda doesn't care, she just sits and stares\nAll her secrets there for the world to see\n[Outro]\nSeda doesn't care, she just sits and stares\nSeda doesn't care, she's just dyin' there\nSeda doesn't care, she's just lyin' there\nAll her secrets there for you and me"
