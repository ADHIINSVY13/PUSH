  "lyrics": "Yes, I do, I believe\nThat one day I will be where I was\nRight there, right next to you\nAnd it's hard, the days just seem so dark\nThe moon, and the stars are nothing without you\nYour touch, your skin, where do I begin?\nNo words can explain the way I'm missing you\nDeny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside\nThese tears, they tell their own story\nTold me not to cry when you were gone\nBut the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong\nCan I lay by your side, next to you? You\nAnd make surе you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nAnd I don't want to bе here if I can't be with you tonight\nI'm reaching out to you\nCan you hear my call, boy?\nThis hurt that I've been through\nI'm missing you, I'm missing you like crazy, you\nCan I lay by your side? Next to you, to you\nAnd make sure you're alright\nI'll take care of you\nAnd I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight\nOh, lay me down tonight\nLay me by your side, whoa\nLay me down tonight\nLay me by your side\nCan I lay by your side? Next to you, you"
