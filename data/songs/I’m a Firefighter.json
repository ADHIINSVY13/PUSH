  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBaby, I'm a firefighter trapped in a burning house in a silent picture\nAnd there is no way out except to watch the love between us die\n[Verse 2]\nThat's called the Falling Angel\nIt's an amusement park ride\nSome sort of rollercoaster\nIt takes you up and when it brings you down\nIt gives you butterflies\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 3]\nAnd now I'm longing for your kiss\nBet you could read it on my lips\nOh\nWaterfalls, I'm jumping down\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 4]\nI know you're leaving, baby\nThe birds are flying south\nAnd there's nothing to say\nI need you here\nI need your love inside of mine like I could die\nI need your love inside of mine like I could die"
