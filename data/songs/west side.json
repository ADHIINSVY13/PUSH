Ariana is demanding in an enticing way on this track.\n[Verse 1]\nI don't wanna think too much\nI just wanna feel\nYou know that it ain't no rush\nLet me keep it real\nJust let me be in your life like that\nIn your life like that\nI'll bring the light right back\nI'll bring the life right back\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm gonna make you want more (More)\nI'm gonna be your new favorite\nTell 'em you closing the door\nI am the only for sure\nOh, babe\n[Chorus]\nHold up, there shouldn't be no hold up\nThere's more love if you follow emotions\nShow up, now if you're down to roll up\nMeet me on the west side for me\nHold up, there shouldn't be no hold up\nThere's more love if you follow emotions\nShow up, now if you're down to roll up\nMeet me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't want it if it ain't your touch\nIt's better every time we chill\nYou ain't gotta bring no stuff\nWe got all we need right here\nJust let me be in your life like that\nBe your wife like that\nI'll bring the light right back\nI'll bring the life right back\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm gonna make you want more (More)\nI'm gonna be your new favorite\nTell 'em you closing the door\nI am the only for sure, baby\nOh, babe, yeah\n[Chorus]\nHold up, there shouldn't be no hold up (Hold up)\nThere's more love if you follow emotions (Emotions)\nShow up, now if you're down to roll up (Roll up)\nMeet me on the west side for me\nHold up, there shouldn't be no hold up\nThere's more love if you follow emotions\nShow up, now if you're down to roll up\nMeet me on the west side for me\n\n[Outro]\nMmm"
