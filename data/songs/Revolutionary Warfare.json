Cheese\nAnd feed him to the rats in the back of the P's\nBlack fatigues and AR-15s on the sofa\n50 inch flat screen, Louis Vuitton holsters\nMy motions don't appeal to appellate divisions\nI did it strong for 7 long years in prison – fuck the system\nI'm like a modern day Hitler\nBlack guerrilla, Crip and Blood in one nigga\nOnly killers know my face\nI beat a case for shooting at the police,\n nigga, the name Lake\nThough simultaneously. the street revolution\n21 gun salute the new Huey Newton\n[Chorus: Nas]\nRevolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war\nFor the cause, I gotta take you off here\nRevolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war\nFor the cause, I gotta take you off here\n\n[Verse 3: Nas & \nLake\n]\nTeach y'all women how to hold the family down\nIn case something happens to its fathers\nProtect the children, grab revolvers\nThe women plays important part of our life force – so what we fight for\nMy heart goes to you, beautiful wife in war\nUh, and listen more and talk less\nWatch all and trust none, demand your respect\nAnd be ready to die for what you believe in\nAnd ride all the time, not just when convenient\nJustice and freedom, wisdom and understanding\nWe the lost children of Israel in this Western world region\nYou ain't a man, you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in\nStrong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong\nIt's more to a war than just getting it on\nConceal your form, cover your tracks, stay prepared\nI don't care if no one's spared in...\n[Chorus: Nas]\nRevolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war\nFor the cause, I gotta take you off here\nRevolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war\nFor the cause, I gotta take you off here\nRevolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war\nFor the cause, I gotta take you off here\nRevolutionary warfare, it's all fair in love and war\nFor the cause, I gotta take you off here"
