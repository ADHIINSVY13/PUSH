Black cat got your tongue?\nFat track got you sprung, now you're hung, do you feel me?\nDum dum diddy, is it me?\nAttempt to reach each and every brother on the streets\nIf not peace, then at least let's get a piece\nI'm tired of seein' bodies on the streets deceased\nLookin' through my highschool yearbook\nReminiscin' of the tears as the years took\nOne homie, two homie, three homies, poof\nWe used to have troops, but now there's no more youth to shoot\nGod, come save the misbegotten\nLost ghetto souls of Black cotton (In God's eyes)\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & \n2Pac\n]\nNobody don't care, no matter how hard I try\n(\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, but I'm pissed\n)\nLook to the sky, and I ask God why\n(\nRotten black cotton in God's eyes\n)\nNobody don't care, seems like my dreams\n(\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, but I'm pissed\n)\nDrowned in by screams, no answer to my questions\n(\nRotten black cotton in God's eyes\n)\nNobody don't care, feels like I'm pressed\n(\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, but I'm pissed\n)\nWhy do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested\n(\nRotten black cotton in God's eyes\n)\nNobody don't care, seems like my prayers\nVanished in thin air, please answer my questions (\nMy man\n)\nNobody don't care\n[Verse 2: Kastro]\nIn the belly of the beast I'm bubblin' up (Uh-huh)\nRunnin' out of luck, about to self-destruct (Uh-huh)\nOld heads say live your life like such\nYou're sure to catch her with your one-day boy, I wouldn't listen to 'em\nYour power movement was cool, but it ain't fix nothin'\nSo I just go with what I know, I don't trust nothin'\nLook what the '80s did to us baby kids\nAnd now we grown up, nobody ain't own us yet\n\n[Verse 3: Young Noble]\nBlack cotton,\n I'm plottin' on what they owe me\nI'm workin' without a profit, they shacklin' all my homies\nI'm hurtin', but keep in mind, it ain't irkin'\nAnd we ain't stop, it's curtains\nYou try to rise and certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridaz\nWhat's the reward for a struggler?\nIf the law lovin' us, then why they hate to see us comin' up?\nRunnin' up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves\nIf you ain't got a penny, mind the glove, no love\nWaitin' for my \nforty acres and a blunt\n to blaze\nBiblical times, good hearts with milita minds\nFor black cotton\n, I'm hoppin' over enemy lines\nFor black cotton\n, I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine\nBlack Cotton\n[Chorus: Eminem & \n2Pac\n]\nNobody don't care, no matter how hard I try\n(\nYeah, they claim niggas' ballin'\n)\nLook to the sky, and I ask God why\n(\nRotten black cotton in God's eyes\n)\nNobody don't care, seems like my dreams\n(\nYou ain't never ballin'\n)\nDrowned in by screams, no answer to my questions\n(\nRotten black cotton in God's eyes\n)\nNobody don't care, feels like I'm pressed\n(\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, but I'm pissed\n)\nWhy do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested\n(\nRotten black cotton in God's eyes\n)\nNobody don't care, seems like my prayers\n(\nPissed, straight pissed\n)\nVanished in thin air, please answer my questions\nNobody don't care\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nClaimin' that I'm ballin'\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, butâ€”\nGhetto gospel, get you like gospel\nClaimin' that I'm ballin'\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this\nGhetto gospel, get you like gospel\nClaimin' that I'm ballin'\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this\nGhetto gospel, get you like gospel\nClaimin' that I'm ballin'\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, but I'm pissed\nThey claimin' that I'm ballin'\nThey claimin' that I'm ballin'"
