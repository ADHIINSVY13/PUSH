  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]\nWe love each other so deeply\nThat I ask you this, sweetheart\nWhy should we quarrel ever\nWhy can't we be enough clever, never to part\n[Chorus: Lady Gaga]\nEvery time we say goodbye I die a little\nEvery time we say goodbye I wonder why a little\nWhy the gods above me who must be in the know\nThink so little of me\nThey allow you to go\n[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]\nWhen you're near\nThere's such an air of spring about it\nI can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it\nThere's no love song finer\nBut how strange the change from major to minor\n[Outro: Lady Gaga]\nEvery time we say goodbye\nEvery time we say goodbye"
