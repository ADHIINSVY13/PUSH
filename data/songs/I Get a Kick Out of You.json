  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nMy story is much too sad to be told\nBut practically everything leaves me totally cold\nThe only exception I know is the case\nWhen I'm out on a quiet spree\nFighting vainly the old ennui\nAnd I suddenly turn and see\nYour fabulous face\n[Verse 1]\nI get no kick from champagne\nMere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all\nSo tell me, why should it be true\nThat I get a kick out of you?\n[Verse 2]\nSome, they may go for cocaine\nI'm sure that if I took even one sniff\nIt would bore me terrifically, too\nYet, I get a kick out of you\n[Bridge]\nI get a kick every time I see you\nStanding there before me\nI get a kick though it's clear to see\nYou obviously do not adore me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI get no kick in a plane\nFlying too high with some gal in the sky\nIs my idea of nothing to do\nYet, I get a kick\nMmm, you give me a boot\nI get a kick out of you"
