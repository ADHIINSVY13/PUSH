(The other side)\nWell, I don't know who told you that (My mama)\nWell, she fucking lied\nAyy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up\nCut it up like it's cocaine, shake up\nAll the streets with all these beats\nI body beats, I'm not discreet \n(Per-Per-Perfect)\nThis is how I feel on the inside\nAll you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide\nYou worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter\nYou gots to get it through your head\nYou won't ever get no handout\nFuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out \n(Per-Per-Perfect)\nMy flow increased, my dough increased\nYou know I leave them all deceased\nI am a fucking beast, I'm from the East\nI keep the peace, don't need a piece\nBut I keep a piece, got it, capisce?\nThat boy gon' eat, this is a feast\nOnce I release, I'm smokin' trees\nI bought my shit, I don't need no lease\nSo fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)\nThis shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police\nShooting my shot like the police\nAll on the block like the police, man, who gon' (Stop, stop)\nThe police \nfrom leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man?\n (\nFire\n, \nper-per-perfect\n)\n\n[Outro: Thalia]\nLogic cites Nujabes, MF Doom, RZA, and Kanye West as key inspirations behind his production style"
