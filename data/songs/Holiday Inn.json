  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBoston at last, and the plane's touching down\nOur hostess is handing the hot towels around\nFrom a terminal gate to a black limousine\nIt's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn\n[Verse 2]\nBoredom's a pastime that one soon acquired\nWhere you get to the stage where you're not even tired\nKicking your heels till the time comes around\nTo pick up your bags and head out of town\n[Chorus]\nSlow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man\nI've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands\nAnd you ain't seen nothing till you've been\nIn a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn\n[Chorus]\nSlow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man\nI've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands\nAnd you ain't seen nothing till you've been\nIn a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn\n[Verse 3]\nOh, I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine\nWith the buildings as big and rooms just the same\nAnd the TV don't work and the French fries are cold\nAnd the room service closed about an hour ago"
