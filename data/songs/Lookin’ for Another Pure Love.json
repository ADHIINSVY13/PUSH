  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNever tears or sorrows came before me in my mind\nI had no problems, never a problem in my life\nNever a worry on my mind\nAll my days before today were happy\nAnd secure until your phone call\nYou were telling me goodbye\n[Chorus]\nNow I'm looking for another love\nI'm looking for another pure love in my life\nAnd I'm looking for another love\nI'm looking for another pure love in my life\nDo it, Jeff\n[Guitar solo: Jeff Beck]\n[Verse 2]\nNow the wheel of fate has turned\nI'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered\nHe is a problem in my life\nI have a problem on my mind\nThings you cherish most in your life\nCan be taken if they're left neglected\nLeaving a problem in your life\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause now I'm looking for another love\nI'm looking for another pure love in my life\nAnd now I'm looking for another love\nAnd now I'm looking for another love\nI'm looking for another pure love in my life\nI'm looking for another love\nI'm looking for another pure love in my life"
