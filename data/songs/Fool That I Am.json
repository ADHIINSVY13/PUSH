  "lyrics": "Fool that I am\nFor falling in love with you\nAnd a fool that I am, oh\nFor thinking you loved me too\nYou took my heart\nAnd then played the part of little coquette\nAll of my dreams, they just disappeared\nLike the smoke from a cigarette, oh\nFool that I am\nFor hoping you'd understand\nAnd thinking you would listen too, oh\nOh, the things... the things I had planned\nBut we couldn't see eye to eye\nSo, darling, darling, darling, this is goodbye\nDo I still care? Fool that I am\nBut I still care, fool that I am"
