  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy funny valentine\nSweet comic valentine\nYou make me smile with my heart\nYour looks are laughable\nUnphotographable\nYet your my favourite work of art\n[Bridge]\nIs your figure less than Greek?\nIs your mouth a little weak?\nWhen you open it to speak\nAre you smart?\n[Chorus]\nBut don't change your hair for me\nNot if you care for me\nStay little valentine, stay\nEach day is valentine's day\n[Bridge] + [Chorus]"
