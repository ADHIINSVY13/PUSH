Know we drinkin' it all\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call\nTo them motherfuckers holding the wall, fuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, yes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call\n[Verse 1: Mello]\nNow look here\nI'm gon' hit the club, man, I'm gon' get some love\nI'm the coolest nigga, ain't gon' spend more than a dub\nI'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend\nNo Ferrari, no Jag', no Bentley, or no Benz\nMight just play the wall with this mean look on my grill\nAct like I'm the hater, the Haitian from Hateville\nI remember her, act like she don't remember me\nWhen I was Cadillac-in', Coupe Deville-in', chickenhead drillin'\n[Chorus: Mello with \nLil' Jon & the East Side Boyz\n]\nTo them niggas that be holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n)\nTo them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nI'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid\nLike some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid\nMakin' a early morning serenade for you to start your day\nOr the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay\nLast call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay\nThe dirty don has informed me the drought has ended today\nWith no delay\nAnd a four-piece grizzle, we on our way\nFor a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay (\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n)\n[Chorus: Mello with \nLil' Jon & the East Side Boyz\n]\nTo them niggas that be holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n)\nTo them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call\n[Verse 3: Slimm Calhoun]\nThem boys so wild, don't crack no smile\nCloset like the Wild Kingdom, fox, minks, and crocodiles\nPopped tops on what we drink, so sit back for a while\nMatter fact, light that and I'll be right back\nThey want a couple more bottles, I got somethin' for 'em to swallow\nAnybody ever told you you look like a model?\nYou know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow\nGot my hooks in the back and I'ma grind until tomorrow\nThey call me Mack Rapalicious and when I bubble, I blow trouble up in your ear\nThey call me Mack Rapalicious and when I bubble, it's trouble all up in you, dear\n\n[Chorus: Mello with \nLil' Jon & the East Side Boyz\n]\nTo them niggas that be holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n)\nTo them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call\n[Verse 4: Mello]\nYes, I know the way excite them hoes\nMe cold reptilian feet bite them hoes\nGot a partner, oh, his mind sick\nHe say he love this old coke-strung-out stripper bitch\nWhy he so dumb? I'm so pimp, it's ridiculous\nGot tinted windows on my ride, I'm inconspicuous\nRun with this pretty thing, she ain't yours, you wish she was\nWe don't stop it, it's so repeated and continuous\nMello Capone, Don Huggy Bear\n, Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous\nAin't that cute? Slick 'em out they drawers, I'm so infamous\nDead serious\nFrom the club to the Caddy to the Holiday Inn\nFrom the dusk 'til the dawn, we gon' do it again\n[Chorus: Mello with \nLil' Jon & the East Side Boyz\n]\nTo them niggas that be holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call (\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n)\nTo them motherfuckers holdin' the wall, \nfuck y'all\nHit the floor, start shakin' it all, \nyes, y'all\nWhat we drinkin'? Know we drinkin' it all (\nAyy\n)\nWe gon' do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call"
