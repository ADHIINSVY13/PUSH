I think I wanna marry you\n[Verse 1]\nWell, \nI know this little chapel on the boulevard, we can go\nNo one will know,\n oh, come on, girl\nWho cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow\nShots of Patr√≥n\n and it's on, girl\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't say no, no, no, no, no\nJust say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd we'll go, go, go, go, go\nIf you're ready, like I'm ready\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do\nHey, baby, I think I wanna marry you\nIs it the look in your eyes, \nor is it this dancing juice?\nWho cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you\nOh\n[Verse 2]\nI'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing like, \"Ooh\"\nSo what you wanna do? Let's just run, girl\nIf we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool\nNo, I won't blame you, it was fun, girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't say no, no, no, no, no\nJust say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd we'll go, go, go, go, go\nIf you're ready, like I'm ready\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do\nHey, baby, I think I wanna marry you\nIs it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?\nWho cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you\n[Bridge]\nJust say, \"I do\"\nTell me right now, baby, tell me right now, baby, baby\nJust say, \"I do\"\nTell me right now, baby, tell me right now, baby, baby, oh\n[Chorus]\nIt's a beautiful night, we're lookin' for somethin' dumb to do\nHey, baby, I think I wanna marry you\nIs it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice?\nWho cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you"
