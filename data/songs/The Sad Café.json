  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOut in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling\nTracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away\nOut of the silver light, the past came softly calling\nAnd I remember the times we spent \ninside the Sad Café\nOh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace\nAnd we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say\nWe thought we could change this world with words like \"love\" and \"freedom\"\nWe were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café\n[Chorus]\nOh, expecting to fly\nWe would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by\n[Verse 2]\nSome of their dreams came true, some just passed away\nAnd some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café\n{Acoustic Solo}\n[Bridge]\nThe clouds rolled in and hid that shore\nNow that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more\nNow I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be\nI don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe the time has drawn the faces I recall\nBut things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all\nNo use in asking why, it just turned out that way\nSo meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café\nWhy don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café\n{Saxophone Solo}"
