I shoot your freckles out\nYou too dark? The infrared show you what the TEC about\nHuh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses\nSecretaries and meetings with big sharks who mad greedy\nWe can sell mo' boats on the coast\nGive coats to the po', and give hope to the broke, then live low\nBut that ain't reality; I look happy, but under the smile, \nyou see a nigga who know –\nOut of three women, two out of three\nWill love you but lead you to they own hidden evil\nBitch! You the reason niggas be beefin' – ho, get on\n'Posed to be Earth\n, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on\nFrom here on, it's a new day\nMillion dollars ain't what it was yesterday\nMany problems, many niggas, most involved, but they fake\nHope y'all relate\n\n[Chorus]\nI carry the cross\n, if Virgin Mary had an abortion\nI'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses\nHad to bring it back to New York\nI'm happy that the streets is back in New York\nFor you rappers, I carry the cross\nI carry the cross\n, if Virgin Mary had an abortion\nI'd still be carried in the chariot by stampedin' horses\nHad to bring it back to New York\nI'm happy that the streets is back in New York\nFor you rappers, I carry the cross\nI carry the cross"
