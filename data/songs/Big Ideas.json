  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, that's quite a number to sing\nSpotlit, getting lowered in\nCan you co-direct and play the twins\nAnd adapt the main theme for mandolins?\nI've conjured up wonderful things\nThe ballad of what could've been\nOver and out\nIt's been a thrill\n[Chorus]\nI had big ideas, the band were so excited\nThe kind you'd rather not share over the phone\nBut now, the orchestra's got us all surrounded\nAnd I cannot for the life of me remember how they go\n[Verse 2]\nCoordinated release\nNationwide festivities\nWe had them out of their seats\nWavin' their arms and stompin' their feet\nSome just hysterical scenes\nThe ballad of what could've been\nOver and out\nReally, it's been a thrill\n\n[Chorus]\nI had big ideas, the band were so excited\nThe kind you'd rather not share over the phone\nBut now, the orchestra's got us all surrounded\nAnd I cannot for the life of me remember how they go\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nI just can't for the life of me remember how they go"
