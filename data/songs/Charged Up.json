I’m doing so good\nEvery time we meet: \"Oh, I’m so sorry\"\n(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas\nThat’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)\n[Sample]\n\"You know, I kept it real\nIt ain’t too many real people out here\nAnd people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long\nIndustry people… regular people…\nAnd then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak.\""
