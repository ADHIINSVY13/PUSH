You seem too far gone\nInfected, standing there all alone\n[Chorus]\n'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't\nAnd everybody wants to think they won't\nAnd everybody makes it 'till they don't\nAnd everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't\n[Post-Chorus]\nThe best of me, the best of me is you\nThe best of me, the best of me was you\n\n[Outro]\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nLadum, badum, mmmm"
