  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOne look, dark room, meant just for you\nTime moved too fast, you play it back\nButtons on a coat, lighthearted joke\nNo proof, not much, but you saw enough\nSmall talk, he drives, coffee at midnight\nThe light reflects the chain on your neck\nHe says, \"Look up\" and your shoulders brush\nNo proof, one touch, but you felt enough\n[Chorus]\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you\nYou can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you\nYou can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)\nYou are in love, true love\nYou are in love\n[Verse 2]\nMorning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday\nYou keep his shirt, he keeps his word\nAnd for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts\nOne step, not much, but it said enough\nYou kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk\nOne night, he wakes, strange look on his face\nPauses, then says \"You're my best friend\"\nAnd you knew what it was, he is in love\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you\nYou can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you\nYou can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)\nYou are in love, true love\n[Bridge]\nAnd so it goes\nYou two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round\nAnd he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown\nAnd you understand now\nWhy they lost their minds and fought the wars\nAnd why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words\n[Breakdown]\n'Cause you can hear it in the silence\nYou can feel it on the way home\nYou can see it with the lights out\nYou are in love, true love\nYou are in love\n[Chorus]\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you\nYou can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you\nYou can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)\nYou are in love, true love\nYou are in love (Ah)\nYou can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)\nYou can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)\nYou can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)\nYou are in love, true love\nYou are in love"
