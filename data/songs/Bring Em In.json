Prob'ly\nGot you sweatin', now you gettin' wet as a tsunami\nWe can do this all day, treat it like a hobby\nBut if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy, don't mind me\n[Chorus]\nI put it down, any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)\nLet the bad girls know we run the town\nSo pick up that cellphone and tell a friend\nTo tell a friend, I put it down\nAny spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)\nLet the bad girls know we run the town\nAnd my niggas blow trees like the wind, so tell a friend\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nTo bring a friend and bring 'em in\nBring 'em in, bring 'em in\nAnd if they all bad you can bring 'em in\nWe take it to the grr, it's just you, me, and them\n[Verse 3]\nDid I meet you for a reason or for a season\nOr either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons?\nWhisper to ya home girl you love Cole World\n'Cause his flow thorough, I give you a few more reasons\nNot because his verse or 'cause I can buy purse\nYou know, the type of shit your man could only purchase on the first\nAnd not because he faker than turf, \nsofter than Nerf footballs\nI got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth\nBecause I'm so clever better than ho-eva\nThe coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters\nWell versed, well rehearsed, the go getter\nThese broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce\n (Argh)\nYou would think niggas would know better\nIt's oh-eleven, you would think niggas would flow better\nI know you're so fed up\nAnd so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header\n, I won't let up\n[Chorus]\nI put it down, any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)\nLet the bad girls know we run the town\nSo pick up that cellphone and tell a friend\nTo tell a friend, I put it down\nAny spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)\nLet the bad girls know we run the town\nAnd my niggas blow trees like the wind, so tell a friend\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nTo bring a friend and bring 'em in\nBring 'em in, bring 'em in\nAnd if they all bad you can bring 'em in\nWe take it to the grr, it's just you, me, and them"
