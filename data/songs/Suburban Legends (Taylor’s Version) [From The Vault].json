  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou had people who called you on unmarked numbers\nIn my peripheral vision\nI let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer\nAll was quickly forgiven\nYou were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious\nFlush with the currency of cool\nI was always turnin' out my empty pockets\nAnd when it came to you\n[Chorus]\nI didn't come here to make friends\nWe were born to be suburban legends\nWhen you hold me, it holds me together\nAnd you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n[Verse 2]\nI had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs\nWould surprise the whole school\nWhen I ended up back at our class reunion\nWalkin' in with you\nYou'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries\nWith the pages ripped out\nI am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium\nAnd I can still see you now\n\n[Chorus]\nI didn't come here to make friends\nWe were born to be suburban legends\nWhen you hold me, it holds me together\nAnd you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\nI know that you still remember\nWe were born to be national treasures\nWhen you told me we'd get back together\nAnd \nyou kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\n[Outro]\nTick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block\nI broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\nWaves crash on the shore, I dash to the door\nYou don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined\nTick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block\nI broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it\nWaves crash to the shore, I dash to the door\nYou don't knock anymore and \nI always knew it\nThat my life would be ruined"
