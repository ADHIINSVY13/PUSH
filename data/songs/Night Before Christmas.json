  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe treetops are leaning, they're covered in snow\nThe fire is burning and you're nearly home\nThe bars are all empty, I can't hear a soul\nWith everything closed now, there's nowhere to go\n[Verse 2]\nCome rest your weary head on my chest\nThe year is behind us, we're still at our best\nThe magic of Christmas is what's coming next\nSo lean in and kiss me and all of the rest\n[Chorus]\nBaby, this time of year\nCan makе you feel old\nBut when I am with you\nI don't feel the cold\n[Bridge]\nSo let's dancе in the kitchen and climb up the stairs\nI hope when we wake up there's love everywhere, mm-hmm\nMm-mm\nMm\n[Chorus]\nBaby, this time of the year\nCan make you feel old\nBut when I am with you\nI don't feel the cold\n\n[Outro]\nHold on to your lovers, be good to your friends, mm\nRemember the people who are no longer there\nLean into the moment, the memories you share\nAnd have a Merry Christmas, everyone, everywhere"
