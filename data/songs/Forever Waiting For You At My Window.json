Well, I hope that you are\nIf you leave me tonight, baby, please don't go too far\nI'm lookin' up at the moonlight like, was I wrong to think you was into me?\nLittle symphonies in my head telling me differently, had an epiphany\nThink I was right this time, maybe\nIt's hard to tell from the position I'm in\nBut it felt like what we had was real\nWhen you had me hooked on a reel, yeah\n[Chorus]\nVisions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night\nClose my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine\nBreathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo\nBut I can stay forever waiting for you at my window\nVisions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night\nClose my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine\nBreathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo\nBut I can stay forever waiting for you at my window\n\n[Outro]\nVisions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night\nClose my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine\nBreathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo\nBut I can stay forever waiting for you at my window\nVisions in my mind, I see you every time I sleep at night\nClose my eyes, I feel your fingers running up and down my spine\nBreathing down my neck, you got me stuck inside the limbo\nBut I can stay forever waiting for you at my window"
