  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTear a star from out of the sky and the sky feels blue\nTear a petal from a rose and the rose weep too\nCome on and take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break\nMy life is yours to make, so please keep the spark awake\nWould you take the wings from a bird so that they can't fly?\nWould you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?\nAll this your heart won't let you do, this is what I beg of you\nNo, don't, don't, no, don't take your love from me\n[Verse 2]\nNow tell me, now tell me would you\nWould you take the wings from a bird so that they can't fly?\nWould you take, would you take the ocean's\nThe ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?\nAll this your heart won't let you do, this is what I beg of you\nNo, don't, don't, don't, don't take your love from me\n[Outro]\nDon't take your love, don't take your love\nDon't take your love, don't take your love from me, child\nYeah, don't take your love, don't take it, don't take it, don't take it\nDon't take your love, don't take your love, don't take it from me"
