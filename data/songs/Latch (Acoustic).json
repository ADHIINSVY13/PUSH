You got me losing every breath\nWhat did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI feel we're close enough\nCould I lock in your love?\nI feel we're close enough\nCould I lock in your love?\n[Chorus]\nNow I've got you in my space\nI won't let go of you\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI'm latching on to you\nNow I've got you in my space\nI won't let go of you\nGot you shackled in my embrace\nI'm latching on to you\nI'm latching on to you"
