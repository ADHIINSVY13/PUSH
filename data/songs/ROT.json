  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhen my time comes, let me leave behind all but six to carry me\nAnd the love that lightened my load along the way\n[Verse 1]\nI'm gettin' sick of my ways, sit in my room and just suffer for days\nI don't remember the sun, the moon is the only one seeing my face\nI know I'm going through things, wondering, when will I get out this phase?\nEvery day, runnin' away from my grave, every day, stuck in a maze\nWhere do I go? How will I end up? When will the devil surrender?\nI feel the weight on my shoulders, I'm back on a binge, yeah, I'm back on a bender\nStarin' out my window counting the raindrops as they fall\nThe clock is laughing at me as I lose myself, I feel my brain rot\n[Chorus]\nRot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot (Yeah)\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot (Yeah)\nI can feel my—\nRot, rot\n[Verse 2]\nBaby, can you save me from myself 'cause I've been waiting for someone to come around and get me high? (Rot)\nI know that you said this was forever, but I looked you in your eyes and I can tell it was a lie (Rot)\nDon't be lookin' at me crazy when I tell you that you made me go insane, you made me lose my mind\nI don't need a conversation, baby, nothing that you say to me gon' stop you from becoming my kryptonite\nYeah\n\n[Chorus]\nRot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot (Yuh)\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot\nI can feel my—\nYeah, yeah\nRot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot (Yuh)\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain rot, rot, rot\nI can feel my—\n[Outro]\nRot, rot, rot\nRot, rot, rot\nRot, rot, rot\nRot, rot, rot\nI can feel my brain"
