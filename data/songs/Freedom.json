Are you tired?\nRunnin' on empty, feelin' the fire\nMmm, the devil is a liar\nThe story's already written\nChildren, you are forgiven (Yeah)\nAin't nothin' you could do for you to change that\nAnd everything you did, He erased that\nYeah, He took it all and threw it in the wasteland\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber & \nBEAM\n]\nFreedom, don't it feel good? (\nMm\n)\nFreedom, don't it feel good?\nFreedom, don't it feel good? (\nMm\n)\nFreedom, don't it feel good? (\nBah\n)\n[Verse 2: BEAM]\nBig up to our Father (Big)\nIf you call 'pon Him, Him answer (Brr)\nAll we need a the begotten son to prosper (Yeah, yeah)\nThe dead resurrected, the devil tried test it, him lost\nHim lose again (Mmm), head bruise again (Mmm-mmm-mmm)\nSweat, blood, tears 'pon the cross, did you know He paid the cost for you?\nWork over North, West, South, and East, Easter Sunday, bun and cheese\nGood Friday, fish and bammy, one table and one family\nAll of the times weh mi cry for The Most High\nGod said, \"No worry about it, my love abundant, you're still mine\" (Mm)\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber & \nBEAM\n]\nFreedom, don't it feel good? (\nMm\n)\nFreedom, don't it feel good?\nFreedom, don't it feel good? (\nMm\n)\nFreedom, don't it feel good?"
