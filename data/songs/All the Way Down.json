  "lyrics": "Out on the street\nThe summer heat\nBoys playing games\nChanging their names\nPulling tricks\nGetting their kicks\nAll the way down\nLet it ride\nMeetin the stars\nIn funky bars\nShiny new cars\nAnd back door lies\nTrying to hike\nOr any other type of ride\nAll the way down\nLet it ride\nTrying everythang now\nGotta check it out\nTrying everythang now\nGotta check it out\nHey girl!\nYou want a blow?\nWhy not?\nI got no where to go\n\nBenny the Albino\nSays don't be a whino\nTry these here flakes\nThey got what it takes\nTo make you a star\nAnd change who you are\nAll the way down\nLet it ride\nTell me were you satisfied?\nDid you mix it?\nDid you like it?\nOooh! Tell me was it good to you\nI wanna know did you make enough money?\nDid you make enough money to go down in style?\nOr did you find yourself just dying, dying, dying, dying, after a while?\nGot to get off!\nGot to get off!\nI got to, got to, got to, got to, got to get off!\nPlease help me, help me!\nTo git off now, now!\nBefore I freeze, and before I can come up off my knees\nAnd lose my key to freedom\nAnd I go, All the way down, All the way down"
