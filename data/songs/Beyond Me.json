I can't tell\nDo tell, do tell\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEverything we love must grow old\nOr so I'm told, or so I'm told\nYou must release what you hold dear\nOr so I fear, or so I fear\n[Chorus]\nBut it's beyond me\nForever young and free\nBut it's beyond me\nForever young and free\n[Verse 2]\nIf it all just went away\nWould you be kind? Would you be so kind?\n\n[Refrain]\nAre you well? I can't tell\nDo tell, do tell\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvеrything we love must grow old\nOr so I'm told, or so I'm told\nYou must relеase what you hold dear\nOr so I fear, or so I fear\n[Chorus]\nBut it's beyond me\nForever young and free\nBut it's beyond me\nForever young and free\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nBut it's beyond me\nForever young and free\nBut it's beyond me\nForever young and free"
