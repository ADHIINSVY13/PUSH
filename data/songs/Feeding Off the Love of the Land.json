  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSeems the wisdom of man hasn't got much wiser\nThan the very beginning of our time\nAgree or war has been our way of compromising\n\"Let live and love\" has become our biggest lie\nSeems to me that fools are even more foolish\nThinking of themselves and nobody else\nBut then if asked for poor will riches be replenished\nThey say bootstraps must be pulled up by themselves\n[Chorus]\nFeeding off the love of the land\nLeaving much to be desired\nLiving off the love of the Lord\nWhile the price for life is higher\nIsn't love to be admired?\nHas the good in man expired?\nStealing all the love and the beauty from the land\n[Verse 2]\nI awake each morning to the birds a-singing\nSinging out to God to come and save his own\nBut when throughout the world the cry of love is ringing\nIs then when He'll stop to hear our song\nDid you know that when you feel the earth a-shaking\nIt's only Mother Nature with a crying heart\nYou see, we have taken from her for so many ages\nWill there be a time when taking stops and giving starts?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause we're feeding off the love of the land\nLeaving much to be desired\nLiving off the love of the Lord\nWhile the price for life is higher\nIsn't love to be admired?\nHas the good in man expired?\nStealing all the love and the beauty from the land\n[Outro]\nYes, we're feeding off the love of the land\nNever hearing what He's saying\nLiving off the love of the Lord\nNever feeling what you're praying\nNever praising Him for beauty\nOnly praying God please give me\nStealing all the love and the beauty from the land\nStealing all the love and the beauty from His land"
