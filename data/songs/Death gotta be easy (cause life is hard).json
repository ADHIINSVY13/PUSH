  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSometimes, you end up gettin' where you wanna go\nAnd then find out when you get there that you don't wanna be where you're at\nAnd then you feel like this is all just a waste of time\nBut just remember, if you never got there then you'd always be wanting to get there\nAnd then you don't know you don't wanna be there until you get there\nSo sometimes you just gotta go where you don't wanna go\nJust to know that that's not whеre you wanna be\nOkay, have a supеr freakin' awesome d— rest of your day and stuff\nOkay, bye\n[Verse]\nYeah, the way I'm livin' these days, you would think it was a phase\nLife is a maze, sometimes amazing\nSometimes so painful, swimming in the rainfall\nDrowning in the nighttime, feel like I need a lifeline\nTalk my shit, I'm 'bout mine, mama said I'm a star\nI don't get involved with slick-ass bitches that's fuckin' all\nThe homies, that lonely road is so oversaturated\nYeah, I been there so many times before\nAnd I know we're living in a world so cruel\nEverybody looking for somebody, yeah, me too\nLet me be the one for you\nCan't keep waiting for somebody to come for you\nLet me comfort you\nSit back and cock the gun for you\nYeah, I hope I never have to run from you\nI'm too comfortable and I don't really like changes\nScared of the future 'cause my past was so dangerous\nFlorida boy with the eyes of a centaur\nBullet in my membrane, more money as I doze off\nI don't get touched, bitch, I'm coleslaw\nBitch said I look like Russ and took her clothes off\nBaby Bone, I don't partake in nonsense\nI'm way too busy to have it weighin' on my conscience\nSo keep talking like Curry, I keep walkin' in the city\nWhere they carry them sticks like too often\nPussy had me jumping out the water like a dolphin\nBitch, I'm riding in that tidal wave, surfing on my coffin\nI paved the way, I paved the lane, I put my city on my back\nSee the gators all around me ready to attack\nThey don't betray the essence of the Florida man\nI can show you to the river, but I cannot hold your hand\nUnderstand what it takes to survive in the land\nWhere everyone is suckin' dick to be a part of the band\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd I know we're living in a world so cruel\nEverybody looking for somebody, yeah, me too\nLet me be the one for you\nCan't keep waiting for somebody to come for you\nLet me comfort you\nSit back and cock the gun for you\nYeah, I hope I never have to run from you\nI'm too comfortable and I don't really like changes\nScared of the future 'cause my past was so dangerous\nThat's kind of hard"
