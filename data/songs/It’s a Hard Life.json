It's a hard life\nIn a world that's filled with sorrow\nThere are people searching\nFor love in every way\nIt's a long, hard fight (Hard fight!)\nBut I'll always live for tomorrow\nI'll look back on myself\nAnd say I did it for love\n[Outro]\nYes, I did it for love\nFor love\nOh, oh, oh I did it \nfor love"
