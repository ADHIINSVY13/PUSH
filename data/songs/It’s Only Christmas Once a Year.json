  "lyrics": "It's only Christmas once a year\nSo gather round the tree\nI'll pour you a cup of cheer\nPlease wear a smile for me\nI'm counting on my fingers all the days till you'll be here\nPlease say that you're coming home for Christmas time\nIt's only Christmas once a year\nLast year was so hard with all the friends I couldn't see\nChristmas without you was not as bright as it could be\nI pushed through those winter nights just wishing you'd appear\nPlease say that you're coming home for Christmas time\nIt's only Christmas once a year\nDo do do do do do\nGather all your loved ones hold them close to your heart\n'Cause one never knows what lies ahead or when you'll part\nThis year is a Christmas I know we will not forget\nGot my head held up and all my decorations set\nTrying not to get my hopes too high and shed no tears\nPlease say that you're coming home for Christmas time\nIt's only Christmas once a year"
