  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n[Verse 1]\nAnd so it goes\nEvery weekend, this same party\nI never go alone\nAnd I don't seem broken-hearted\nMy friends all say they know\nEverything I'm going through\nI drive down different roads\nBut they all lead back to you\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel\nThey weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell\nDidn't read the note on the Polaroid picture\nThey don't know how much I miss you\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd so it was\nWe never saw it comin'\nNot trying to fall in love\nBut we did like children runnin'\nBack then, we didn't know\nWe were built to fall apart\nWe broke the status quo\nThen we broke each other's hearts\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut don't forget about the night out in L.A\nDance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway\nNo one knows about the words that we whispered\nNo one knows how much I miss you\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n[Post-Chorus]\nTake me away, take me away\nTake me away to you, to you\nTake me away, take me away\nTake me away to you, to you\n\n[Bridge]\nI remember the night at the hotel\nI was ridin' in the car when we both fell\nI'm the one on the phone as you whisper\n\"Do you know how much I miss you?\"\n[Breakdown]\nI wish that we could go back in time\nAnd I'd say to you\n\"I miss you like it was the very first night\"\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could fly\nI'd pick you up and we'd go back in time\nI'd write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n[Post-Chorus]\nTake me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)\nTake me away (Take me) to you, to you\nTake me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)\nTake me away (Take me) to you, to you"
