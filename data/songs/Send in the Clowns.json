  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThis is a song about a couple of adult people who have spent\nOh, quite a long time together\n'Til one day, one of 'em gets restless and decides to leave\nWhether it's the man or woman who left is unimportant\nIt's a breakup\nAnd it's a lovely marriage of words and music\nWritten by Stephen Sondheim\n[Verse 1]\nIsn't it rich?\nAre we a pair?\nMe here at last on the ground\nAnd you in mid-air\nSend in the clowns\n[Verse 2]\nIsn't it bliss?\nDon't you approve?\nOne who keeps tearing around\nAnd one who can't move\nBut where are the clowns?\nSend in the clowns\n[Bridge]\nJust when I stopped opening doors\nFinally finding the one that I wanted was yours\nMaking my entrance again with my usual flair\nSure of my lines, nobody's there\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't you love a farce?\nMy fault, I fear\nI thought that you'd want what I want\nSorry, my dear\nBut where are the clowns?\nSend in the clowns\nDon't bother, they're here\n[Verse 4]\nIsn't it rich?\nIsn't it queer\nLosing my timing this late\nIn my career?\nBut where are the clowns?\nSend in the clowns\nWell, maybe next year"
