  "lyrics": "[Part 1]\nThe falling leaves\nDrift by the window\nThe autumn leaves\nOf red and gold\nI see your lips\nThe summer kisses\nThe sunburned hands\nI used to hold\nSince you went away\nThe days grow long\nAnd soon I'll hear\nOld winter's song\nBut I miss you most of all\nMy darling\nWhen autumn leaves\nS\ntart to fall"
