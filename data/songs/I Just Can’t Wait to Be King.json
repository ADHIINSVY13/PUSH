  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWay behind the water hole, a little down the line\nThe jungle and the plains and peaks are scheduled to be mine\nI'm gonna be the ruler of most everythin' around\nFrom the grandest top of the mountains to the humble common ground\nMy reign will be a super awesome thing\nOh, I just can't wait to be king\n[Verse 2]\nI'm gonna be a noble king, unscrupulously fair\nI only need a little time, perhaps a little hair\nI'm gonna be the main event like no king was before\nI'm brushin' up on lookin' down, I'm workin' on my roar\nThe fauna and the flora gonna swing\nOh, I just can't wait to be king\n[Chorus]\nNo one sayin', \"Do this\"\nNo one sayin', \"Be there\"\nNo one sayin', \"Stop that\"\nNo one sayin', \"See here\"\nFree to run around all day\nI'll be free to do it my way\nHey\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus]\nNo one sayin', \"Do this\"\nNo one sayin', \"Be there\"\nNo one sayin', \"Stop that\"\nNo one sayin', \"See here\"\nFree to run around all day\nFree to do it my way\n[Verse 3]\n\"The time has come,\" as someone said, \"to talk of many things\"\nThat may be true, but I would rather stick to talkin' kings\nIt's easy to be royal if you're already leonine\nIt isn't just my right, even my left will be divine\nThe monarchy is waitin' to go zing\nOh, I just can't wait to be king\nOh, oh\nOh, I just can't wait to be king\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh"
