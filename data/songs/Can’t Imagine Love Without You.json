  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCan you picture mother earth in the palm of your hand?\nThe entire universe as a tiny grain of sand\nAnd it feels impossible to do\n[Chorus]\nAs i can't imagine love without you\n[Verse 2]\nThink of drinking every sea with its salty waters dry\nSprinting around the world three times faster than a rocket flies\nAnd the thought of it you can't pursue\n[Chorus]\n[Bridge]\nSome thoughts are just no brainers\nNot worth an ounce of time\nYet others inconceivable\nSo they never cross your mind\n[Verse 3]\nTravel back though life inside one atlantis summer's night\nAdd up every single star\nSince the day there first was light\nHow and where to start\nYou'll have no clue\n\n[Chorus]\n[Verse 4]\nYet others inconceivable\nSo they never cross your mind\nTravel back though life inside one atlantis summer's night\nAdd up every single star\nSince the day there first was light\nHow and where to start\nYou'll have no clue\nAnd the thought of it you can't pursue\nBecause it feels impossible to do\n[Outro]\nAs i can't imagine love without you\nI can't imagine love without you"
