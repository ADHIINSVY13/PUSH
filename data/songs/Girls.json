You scared? And, Fred, you said you was dissin' him too\nI shoulda knew better than to listen to you\nYou're fuckin' sissy, up on stage, screamin' how people hate you\nThey don't hate you, \nthey just think you're corny since Christina played you\nAnd I dare you, motherfuckers, to try to diss me back\nThat's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin' my ass\n'Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song, I'm tryna to pre-warn you\nLethal, when I fuckin' see you, dog, I'm swingin' on you\nMotherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law\nThat I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow\nY'all some\n\n[Chorus]\nGirls (Y'all are some goddamn girls)\nWhy do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)\nWhy do y'all act like fuckin' sissies? You're pussies\nKeep talkin' shit behind my back—you're just some bitches for that\nAnd we all know (We all know, hah)\nHow fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin', rollin', rollin')\nIn fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down\nBut as soon as someone calls you out\nYou put your tail between your legs and bow down\n[Post-Chorus]\nNow, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs\nOr be involved in my beefs\nI'm a man, I can stand on my feet\nSo if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask\nIs that you don't open your mouth with an opinion\nAnd I won't put you in 'em\n'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs\nOr be involved in my beefs\nI'm a man, I can stand on my feet\nSo if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask\nIs that you don't open your mouth with an opinion\nAnd I won't put you in 'em\n[Verse 2]\nNow see, if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on\nBut if I help you sell one record and I see you at a show, \nI'll strip you naked\nSee, I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends\nNow I got five dawgs that'd die for me like I'd die for them\nI'd fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim\nAll of 'em been with me through this fucked-up life that I'm in\nThat goes for all of my dawgs, from Royce to Dre\nFrom Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away\nIn my coffin, I'll never soften,\n no matter how often I'm tested\nI'll never give a fuck,\n I won't never be interested\nLove me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated\nI will solemnly stand by every statement I stated\nThis shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil\nBut I will never be this gullible ever again, no (Nope)\nNext time, I'll know when someone's copyin' off me\nI'm not bein' cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin' me\nI stick up my middle finger—he sticks up his finger (Hey)\nI say, \"Fuck Christina\",—he says, \"Fuck Christina\", but meaner\nSo from doin' a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted\nI'm peggin' Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with\nAnd as for Lethal, don't forget what I said\nI'm fuckin' you up, punk, you're dead, don't think that I'm playin'\nAnd fuck Bizkit, 'cause I know you're sayin', \"Fuck D12\"\nOnly not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves\nLittle\n\n[Chorus]\nGirls (Motherfuckin' females)\nWhy do you act this way? (Why do you act this way, huh?)\nWhy do y'all act like fuckin' sissies? You're pussies\nKeep talkin' shit behind my back, you just some bitches for that\nAnd we all know (We all know the truth)\nHow fuckin' cowards roll (Keep rollin', rollin', rollin')\nIn fuckin' Bentleys and pretend to be down\nBut as soon as someone calls you out\nYou put your tail between your legs and bow down\n[Post-Chorus]\nNow, I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs\nOr be involved in my beefs\nI'm a man, I can stand on my feet\nSo if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask\nIs that you don't open your mouth with an opinion\nAnd I won't put you in 'em\n'Cause I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs\nOr be involved in my beefs\nI'm a man, I can stand on my feet\nSo if you don't wanna be in 'em, all I ask\nIs that you don't open your mouth with an opinion\nAnd I won't put you in 'em\n[Outro]\nAnd that's it, that's all there is to it, dawg\nIf you didn't wanna do the fuckin' song\nDon't say you're down with doin' the fuckin' song\nAnd then back out at the last minute\nAnd then go on motherfuckin' MTV\nTalkin' about Everlast can whip my motherfuckin' ass\nIf you're scared of Whitey Ford, dawg\nJust say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it\nThat's all you had to fuckin' say, I wouldn'ta said shit\nI woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin' song myself\nAnd not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all\nNow, I ain't even on no rap shit no more\nI'm on some fuckin'-you-up-shit when I see you\nAnd I will see you, too\nOh, and, by the way, Fred\nThat wasn't an accident\nI didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards\nHaha"
