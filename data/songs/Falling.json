What am I now?\nWhat if I'm someone I don't want around?\nI'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'\nWhat if I'm down? What if I'm out?\nWhat if I'm someone you won't talk about?\nI'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'\n[Verse 2]\nYou said you cared, and you missed me too\nAnd I'm well aware I write too many songs about you\nAnd the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe\nAnd it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say\n[Chorus]\nWhat am I now? What am I now?\nWhat if I'm someone I don't want around?\nI'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'\nWhat if I'm down? What if I'm out?\nWhat if I'm someone you won't talk about?\nI'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I get the feeling that you'll never need me again (Oh)\n[Chorus]\nWhat am I now? What am I now?\nWhat if you're someone I just want around?\nI'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'\nWhat if I'm down? What if I'm out?\nWhat if I'm someone you won't talk about?\nI'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'"
