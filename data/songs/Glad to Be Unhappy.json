  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nLook at yourself, if you had a sense of humor\nYou would laugh to beat the band\nAnd look at yourself, do you still believe the rumor\nThat romance is simply grand?\nSince you took it right on the chin\nYou have lost that bright toothpaste grin\nMy mental state is all a-jumble\nI sit around and sadly mumble\n[Chorus]\nFools rush in, so here I am\nVery glad to be unhappy\nI can't win, but here I am\nMore than glad to be unhappy\nUnrequited love's a bore\nAnd I've got it pretty bad\nBut for someone you adore\nIt's a pleasure to be sad\nLike a straying baby lamb\nWith no mammy and no pappy\nI'm so unhappy\nBut oh, so glad"
