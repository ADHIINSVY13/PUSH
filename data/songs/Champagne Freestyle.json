  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSee, I'm not a freestyler but I'ma try a lil' something 'cause champagne got me feeling right\nChampagne got me feeling right\nYou know what I'm saying?\nCheck it out, check it out, check it out\n[Verse]\nThere's all kinds of MCs, short ones, black ones\nDope ones, wack ones\nBut only one fat, black one that's platinum\nCheck it out, as I flow on and on and on until the break of days, straight off the dome\nWho roam the streets? Who rule the beats?\nBig Poppa, show stopper, who smacked ya?\nSmacked you up against the wall\nPut the gun to your head - bow, bow, bow! Now ya fall"
