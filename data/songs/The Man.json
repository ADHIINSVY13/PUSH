  "lyrics": "Written in 2011, Ed raps about a recently ended relationship. Ed focuses on “the man” that she cheated on him with, and how, if they hadn’t broken up, they could’ve been together forever.\n[Verse 1]\nNow, I don't wanna hate you\nJust wish you'd never gone for the man\nAnd waited two weeks, at least\nBefore you'd let him take you\nI stayed true, I kind of knew\nYou liked the dude from private school\nHe's waitin' for the time to move\nI knew he had his eyes on you\nHe's not the right guy for you\nDon't hate me 'cause I write the truth\nNo, I would never lie to you\nBut it was never fine to lose you\nAnd what a way to find out\nIt never came from my mouth\nYou never changed your mind\nBut you were just afraid to find out\nBut **** it\nI won't be changin' the subject, I love it\nI'll make your little secret public, it's nothin'\nI'm just disgusted with the skeletons\nYou sleep with in your closet to get back at me\nTrapped and I'm lacking sleep\nFact is, you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually\nYou're practically my family\nIf we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be\nBut tragically, our love just lost the will to live\nBut would I kill to give it one more shot? I think not\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't love you, baby\nI don't need you, baby\nI don't want you, no\nAnymore\nI don't love you, baby\nI don't need you, baby\nI don't wanna love you, no\nAnymore\n[Verse 2]\nRecently, I tend to zone out\nUp in my headphones to \"Holocene\"\nYou promised your body, but I'm away so much\nI stay more celibate than in a monastery\nI'm not cut out for life on the road\n'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much\nAnd at the time, we'd just go, so sue me\nI guess I'm not the man that you need\nEver since you went to Uni'\nI've been sofa surfing with a rucksack\nFull of less cash and I guess that could get bad\nBut when I broke the industry\nThat's when I broke your heart\nI was supposed to chart and celebrate\nBut good things are over fast\nI know it's hard to deal with and see this\nI tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\nThen I turn the music off\nAnd all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\nI never really want to believe this\nGot advice from my dad and he told me that family\nIs all I'll ever have and need\nI guess I'm unaware of it\nSuccess is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't love you, baby\nI don't need you, baby\nI don't want you, no\nAnymore\nI don't love you, baby\nI don't need you, baby\nI don't wanna love you, no\nAnymore\n[Verse 3]\nAnd since you left, I've given up my days off\nIt's what I need to stay strong\nI know you have a day job but mine is 24/7\nI feel like writin' a book,\n \nI guess I lied in the hook\n'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\nThe irony is, if my career in music didn't exist\nIn six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid\nI'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\nAnd lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral\nAnd it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill\nAnd I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill\nGo down in history as just a wasted talent\nCan I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?\nIt's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me\nEventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be\nEither way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this\nThese things happen for a reason and you can't change ****\nTake my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty\nBut I had to get this off my chest\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't love you, baby\nI don't need you, baby\nI don't want you, no\nAnymore (Ah)\nI don't love you, baby\nI don't need you, baby (Oh, no)\nI don't wanna love you, no (Oh, no)\nAnymore (Oh, no, now)"
