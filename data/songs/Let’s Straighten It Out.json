  "lyrics": "Everybody's got to straighten out somethings, sometime\nI don't care how old you are or how young you are\nBut I want you to think about the last time\nThat you heard somebody say, \"Let's straighten it out\"\nAnd I'll bet it was a man that said it, why?\nBecause most of the time it's a man\nWho makes it crooked in the first place\nYou see, men have a tendency to take women for granted\nBut I believe, a woman feels things deeper than a man\nAnd I believe, that a woman loves stronger than a man\nSit yourself down and talk to me\nTell me what's on your mind\nDon't you keep on telling me everything's okay\n'Cause if it was, you wouldn't be crying\nYou've been tossin' and turnin' in your sleep lately, babe\nSittin' around poutin' all day long\nHow in the hell do you expect me to understand?\nWhen I don't even know, don't know what's wrong, yeah\nLet's straighten it out\nAh baby, let's straighten it out\nHoney, let's straighten it out\nAh, let's straighten it out\n\nLet's straighten it out\nOh baby, let's straighten it out\nCan't hear you honey, ah, let's straighten it out\nC'mon, let's straighten it out\nFor the last five nights, honey\nWhen we went to bed, I could tell something wasn't right\nWhen you turned your back on me\nAnd you covered your head, didn't even say goodnight\nIf you're tired and don't wanna be bothered, baby\nJust say the words, I'll leave you alone\nInstead of laying there, cryin' your eyes out\nYou and me ought to be gettin' along\nAh, let's straighten it out\nMmm, let's straighten it out\nLet's straighten it out, baby\nAh, let's straighten it out\nC'mon, let's straighten it out\nJust say the words, I'll straighten it out\nInstead of laying there, cryin' your eyes out\nYou and me ought to be gettin' along\nOh, let's straighten it out\nOh, baby, let's straighten it out\nHey, honey, let's straighten it out\nAhh, let's straighten it out\n\nLet's straighten it out\nLet's straighten it out\nLet's straighten it out\nLet's straighten it out"
