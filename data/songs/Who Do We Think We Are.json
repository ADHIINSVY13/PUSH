We should start looking high of our self like we do to other people.\n[Produced by Bink! & Co]\n[Intro: Lenny Kravitz]\nWhen was the last time we got to be 100% real, ya'll?\nI don't want ya'll holding back nothing!\n[John Legend]\nWho do we think we are?\nBaby, tell me, who do we think we are?\n[Verse 1: John Legend]\nWe made a lot of magic\nIt’s the only way we know\nLet’s trip the night fantastic\nLight it up, tell me more, explore\nWe love, we love, we love the stars\nWe could fall so hard\nThe drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars\nWhy’d we ball so hard?\n[Hook: John Legend]\nYeah, I’m not afraid to fly\nHere we are, in the air, barely breathing\nAnd we’re not afraid to die\nWho do we think we are?\nBaby, tell me, who do we think we are?\nWho do we think we are?\nBaby, tell me, who do we think we are?\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nWe’ve got a lot of nerve, girl\nWe walk around here like we own this place\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nSee my jewels dripping on my Timberlands\nStepping like a criminal, success is so imminent\nPink champagne,\n black Rolls Royce\nEggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford\nBon voyage, left haters in the fog\nLook up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss\nLook into my eyes as I fantasize for us\nStill actin’ shy like this is summer class crush\nMoney comin’ fast, I’m never in a rush, no\nPlus another twenty in the tuck\nSemi in the truck, another forty on the wrist\nQuarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like I pitch\nDodging Robin Givens,\n \nballing like I’m Roger Clemens\nStill in the game, uniform all linen\nShe get Chanel\n, \nski trips to Vail\nOnly the highest grade, like trees that I inhale\n[Hook: John Legend]\nYeah, I’m not afraid to fly\nHere we are, in the air, barely breathing\nAnd we’re not afraid to die\nWho do we think we are?\nBaby, tell me, who do we think we are?\nWho do we think we are?\nBaby, tell me, who do we think we are?\n\n[Outro: John Legend]\nWho do we think we are?\nI don’t know about y’all, but I feel good tonight\nThere’s something in the air tonight\nYou know, everyone needs someone to look up to\nWhy shouldn't it be us?\nWho do we think we are?\nTell me, who do we think we are?\nWho do we think we are?\nTell me, who do we think we are?\n[Lenny Kravitz]\nThis is our song – our song for the future"
