Once upon a time, not too long ago, there was a garden, where children from all over the world came to play and laugh, and they lived together there. And each morning, a big yellow sun would shine over the horizon on the sleeping children, and a bright blue robin would start singing in the trees so happy that all the children would awaken and rub their eyes and stretch. Now, in this garden, there were big beautiful fruit trees with big brown limbs...\n[Instrumental]"
