  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nUnder constant correction, a fraud, a fraud\nSomeone's perception, trying not to bore\nI'm a cold-hearted kidder, applaud, applaud\nIf you're the highest bidder, I'm yours\nYou think we have pathetic sets\nAnd we're not sure of the etiquette\nAlthough we know they're pathetic sets\nAnd we're not sure of the etiquette\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if you found this, it's probably too late\nClinically cynical, hereditary hate\nIf you found this, it's probably too late\nApproaching the pinnacle, I'm running out of mates\nIf we concentrate on being off the cuff\nNot sure we're ready, but probably rough\nFrightened that honesty isn't enough\nAnd it's nothing on the early stuff"
