Ayo, what's up with the crew?\nIs them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?\"\nI said, \"If you ain't up on thangs\nSnoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the gang\"\nIt's like this, they don't understand\nIt's an everyday thang to gangbang\nMake that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know\nWhat's up with you? I represent the Pound and Death Row\nAnd can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach\nOr Compton and Watts see D-O-Gs\n, now\nYou can't come and you can't run, and you can't\nSee long to the G of the gang, one gun\nIs all that we need to put you to rest\n(Pump-pump)\n Put two slugs dead in your chest\nNow you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping\nSix feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is\n\n[Chorus: The D.O.C.]\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\n[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]\nThe cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue\nNow you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew\nAin't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do\nLeave you in a state of paranoia, ooh\nDon't make a move for your gat so soon\n'Cause I drops bombs like \nPlatoon\n (Ayy, nigga)\nWalk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you\nI'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you (I won't leave you)\nUntil you get the full comprehension\nAnd when you do, that's when the mission\nOr survival becomes your every thought\nKeep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught\nHalf-stepping with your weapon on safety\nNow break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me\nTake this 211 to another level\nI come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil\nNow roam through the depths of Hell\nWhere the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well\n\n[Chorus: The D.O.C. & \nSnoop Dogg\n]\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nWake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal\n[Verse 4: RBX]\nDeep, deep like the mind of Minolta\nNow picture this\nLet's picnic inside a morgue\nNot pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets\nAnd I got the machine to crack your fuckin' chest plate\nOpen and release them guts\nThen I release def cuts\nBrutal, jagged edged, totally roughneck\nNow everybody scream, 'nuff respect to the X\n'Nuff respect given\nDisrespect and you will not be living\nWord to mama and my drama, dilemma\n[Chorus: The D.O.C., \nSnoop Dogg\n & \nRBX\n]\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nWake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal"
