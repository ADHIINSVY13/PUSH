  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLove can have its mysteries\nSome strange, enchanted notion\nYou can't explain just how it begins\nA feel, a smile, a potion\nBut something goes off in your head\nYou can't believe the words you just said\nIt's not so hard to see the light\nLovers at first sight\nWhen the right one comes along\nAh there's no hesitation\nYou wonder how you lost all control\nIt's just a revelation\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's the way I felt with you\nOne glance was all it took and I knew\nYou and I were just so right\nLovers at first sight\n[Verse 2]\nJe t'aime beaucoups, mon cherie\nI love that you love me\nJai' envie d'etre pres de toi\nAh, I want you too\n'Cause when we are together\nThere is no place in this world that I'd rather be\nGirl\nDura-t-il pour toujours?\nYes, it's forever\nEst-ce que tu me promets?\nI promise, my cherie\n'Cause you know nothing will change\nThe way we're going to live together\nIn our little fantasy\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's the way I felt with you\nOne glance was all it took and I knew\nYou and I were just so right\nLovers at first sight\n[Outro]\nLovers at first sight\nFirst sight\nDepuis que j'etais un enfant\nJe t'aimais\nFirst sight\nMais tu ne savais pas que j'existais\nLovers\nEt maintenant que nous sommes ensemble\nTu dis que c'est l'amour du premier coup\nFirst sight"
