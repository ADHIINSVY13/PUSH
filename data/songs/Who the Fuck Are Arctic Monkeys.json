  "lyrics": "A song about the music industry and how fickle it can be.\n[Verse 1: Alex Turner]\nWe all want someone to shout for\nYeah, everyone wants somebody to adore\nBut your heroes aren't what they seem\nWhen you've been where we've been\nHave I done something to trigger\nThe funny looks and the sniggers?\nAre they there at all\nOr is it just paranoia?\n[Chorus: Alex Turner, \nAlex Turner & Matt Helders\n]\n'Cause everybody's got their box\nDoing what they're told\nYou push my faith near being lost\nBut we'll \nstick to the guns\nDon't care if it's marketing suicide\nWe won't crack or compromise\nYour derisory divides\nWill never unhinge us\n[Verse 2: Alex Turner]\nAnd there's a couple of hundred\nThink they're Christopher Columbus\nBut the settlers had already settled\nHere long before you\nJust 'cause we're having a say-so\nNot lining up to be Play-Doh\nOh, in five years' time will it be\n\"Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?\"\n\n[Chorus: Alex Turner, \nAlex Turner & Matt Helders\n]\n'Cause everybody's got their box\nDoing what they're told\nYou push my faith near being lost\nBut we'll \nstick to the guns\nDon't care if it's marketing suicide\nWe won't crack or compromise\nYour derisory divides\nWill never unhinge us\n[Interlude]\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da\n[Verse 3: Alex Turner]\nAll the thoughts that I just said\nLinger 'round and multiply in the head\nNot that bad to start with\nI'm not angry, I'm just disappointed\n[Bridge: Matt Helders, \nAlex Turner\n]\nIt's not you, it's them that are wrong\nTell 'em to take out their tongues\nTell 'em to take out their tongues\nIt's not you, it's them that are wrong\nTell 'em to take out their tongues\nTell 'em to take out their tongues\nAnd bring on the backlash\n\n[Bridge: Alex Turner]\nIt's not you, it's them that are wrong\nTell him to take out his tongue\nTell him to take out his tongue\nIt's not you, it's them that's the fake\nI won't mess with your escape\nIs this really your escape? Yeah\n[Instrumental Outro]"
