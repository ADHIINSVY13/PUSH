Cole & \nDamian Lillard\n]\nIt ain't nothing I want more\nAin't nothing I want more\nI ain't c–\nI told you, when I first came here, I said, \"I ain't come here to waste my time\"\nI came here\nThey gave us a chance to get in, like we asked for\nAnd that's, that's what we here to do\nYeah, nigga, 2-6\nThe job still ain't done\nStraight up\nBut I, I said, \"You, you know what I'm here for\"\n[Verse: J. Cole]\nBack on top, punchin' the clock, clutchin' sanity\nI got more cribs than Habitat for Humanity\nShit profound, we propagating more profanity\nPaid off collections from recollections of calamity\n (\nOh shit, look, that nigga 'bout to shoot\n)\nThe shit pop off, I learned to duck under the canopy (\nOh shit, run, nigga, run\n)\n'Til it cool off, they murked a nigga right in front of me\nTold him to come off his chain for tryna floss\nDied over a cross just like the start of Christianity\nWhen I was a boy, the teacher often reprimanded me (\nJermaine\n)\nThought it was toys, it was a Glock this nigga handed me\nI busted the trees, was barely strong enough to squeeze\nBullets traveled through leaves, it probably killed somebody randomly\nRan in the crib and played it off amongst the family\nNightmare scenes, the police finally apprehended me\nWoke up screamin', seen a demon had his hand on me\nStill sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me\nLike a Que Dog\n, \nmy niggas burnin' with the mute off\nLoud pack smoke through the cracks, I catch a contact\nTriggerin' a paranoid mindset, now I'm back\nTeeterin' between enlightened and insanity\nNow that I'm rich, I feel nobody understandin' me\nAll I can do is cut the mic on, holler at you\nCan't let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly\nAll them niggas that sold 'caine, they started singin' like Danity\nNow I'm left here, paid like I planned to be, damn\n\n[Outro: Damian Lillard]\nA lotta times, those situations are, um, are handled way before the time comes\nIn the summer, I think when you truly prepare yourself, and\nWith training and conditioning, and things like that\nWhen you cheat yourself, you fail in those moments\nYou know, you crash, and when you really put the time in and\nWhether people see it, or whether people know it or not\nYou know, it always come to light"
