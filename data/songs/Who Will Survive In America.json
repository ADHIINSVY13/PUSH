  "lyrics": "[Verse: Gil Scott-Heron]\nUs living as we do upside-down\nAnd the new word to have is revolution\nPeople don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel\nBecause God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued\nAnd America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey\nThe youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night\nDigging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys\nAmerica stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes\nThe signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina\nWe learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal\nTwo long centuries buried in the musty vault\nHosed down daily with a gagging perfume\nAmerica was a bastard\nThe illegitimate daughter of the mother country\nWhose legs were then spread around the world\nAnd a rapist known as freedom, free-doom\nDemocracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling\nIn the mother country's crotch\nWhat does Webster say about soul?\nAll I want is a good home and a wife\nAnd a children, and some food to feed them every night\nAfter all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\n\n[Clapping]"
