  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLately, I've been seeing things\nBelly button piercings\nIn the sky at night\nWhen we're side by side\nAnd I don't mean to rain\nOn anybody's cabriolet\nOne of those games you're gonna lose\nBut you wanna play it, just in case\n[Chorus]\nNow it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky\nMore like black treacle than tar, black treacle\nSomebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight\nAnd so they found a place to hide\n[Verse 2]\nDoes it help you stay up late?\nDoes it help you concentrate?\nDoes it tune you in when you chew your chin?\nAm I ruining your fun?\nAnd you talk the talk alright\nBut do you walk the walk or catch the train?\nYou wanted it, you got it\nBut you don't want it now\n\n[Chorus]\nNow it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky\nMore like black treacle than tar, black treacle\nSomebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight\nAnd so they found a place to hide\n[Bridge]\nNow I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser\nI feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer\nAnd I tried last night to pack away your laugh\nLike a key under the mat\nBut it never seems to be there when you want it\n[Outro]\nBlack treacle\nBlack treacle\nBlack treacle"
