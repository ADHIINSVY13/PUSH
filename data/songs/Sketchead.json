  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSketchead is coming to your party\nHe's walking up your drive and he's swinging all his keys around\nSketchead, he's seen you with your top off\nHe already knows your boyfriend, retain your introductions\nSketchead, that cumbersome protagonist\nThe pips in your quince,\n the eye behind the spy hole\nThe itch you can't itch in your ear\nAnd the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints\n[Verse 2]\nSketchead, there's poison in his spit\nHe'll compliment your tits and leave you to your wits\nSketchead, convincingly insisting\nThe tyres were bald when you gave him the car\nSketchead, still coming to your party\nStill walking up your drive and still swinging all his keys around\nOn his finger \nas a pendulum to unnerve\n[Verse 3]\nAnd then there's you, you've changed\nI approached you like you were the same\nBut soon it was apparent a new name was required\nNew lips went and fired accomplishments at me\nWhile I'm captivated by your magazine skin\nThe tint on your lenses obscures to begin\nAnd you know full well that anyone who says that\nThey don't prefer the sequel\n will still be swinging on themselves tonight"
