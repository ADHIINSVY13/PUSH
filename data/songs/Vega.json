  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nRain keeps beating on the rooftop, muddying the glass\nBut, God, I love the sound of heaven\nSat cross-legged on the carpet\nListenin' to vinyl, trying to ignore the weather\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis week was heavy, I buckled under all the weight\nWhat can you do, but pray?\nAnd count your blessings, it wasn't any other way\nDon't leave it up to fate\n[Chorus]\nFighting the tide, but the waves, they will part\nLight up the night, we were made to be stars\nBut it burns like hell to be Vega\n[Verse 2]\nClouds keep forming over this house\nBlocking out the sun, I'm tryna keep it all together\nOne door closes then one opens, gotta keep the focus\nIf we believe, then she'll get better\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe days are long, but they pass within an instant, babe\nIt is the strangest thing\nI'll count my blessings the day I see you smile again\nThis war, we've got to win\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep it inside, don't let no one see your heart\nNo one can judge, we're the same in the dark\nFighting the tide, but the waves, they will part\nLight up the night, we were made to be stars\nBut it burns like hell to be Vega\n[Bridge]\nSame problems, different options\nPain comes at a cost, but we've got this\nNeed rest-bite, bleed time dry\nShe'll be fine, she'll be fine\nSame problems, different options\nPain comes at a cost, but we've got this\nNeed rest-bite, bleed time dry\nShe'll be fine, she'll be fine\n[Outro]\nRain keeps beating on the rooftop, worrying to death\nBut I guess this is human nature\nWe are made to shine like stars, but\nThat don't mean it don't burn like hell to be Vega"
