Your heart has never been broken!\nYour pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!\nOne of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!\nI bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!\nOne of these days, one of these days\n[Verse 3]\nOne of these days, your eyes will close\nAnd pain will disappear\nOne of these days, you will forget\nTo hope and learn to fear\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut it's alright, yeah, it's alright\nSaid it's alright\n[Chorus]\nEasy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!\nYour pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!\nOne of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!\nI bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!\nOne of these days, one of these days\n[Bridge]\nBut it's alright, yeah, it's alright\nSaid it's alright, yeah, it's alright\nDon't say it's alright, don't say it's alright\nDon't say it's alright\n[Verse 4]\nOne of these days, your heart will stop\nAnd play its final beat\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut it's alright\n[Chorus]\nEasy for you to say! Your heart has never been broken!\nYour pride has never been stolen! Not yet, not yet!\nOne of these days, I bet your heart'll be broken!\nI bet your pride'll be stolen! I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet!\nOne of these days, one of these days\nOne of these days"
