  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI left my heart at a pub in Hampstead\nAnd I misplaced my mind in a good way\nThrew away my reputation, but saved us more heartache\nYes, I know it seems fucked up and you're right\nBut quite frankly, you’re still wrong about everything\nSo far off, your seat's nowhere near the table\nBut I find something sweet in your peculiar behavior\n'Cause I think to be so dumb must be nice\nI do, I do, I do, I do\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat makes you think you’re even invited?\nThe doors are closed with lights off inside and all the while\nTherе's no one home, you're still outsidе\nI wonder why\n[Chorus]\nWhat's wrong with a little bit of \npoison\n? Tell me\nI would rather feel everything than nothing every time\nOoh, fear me, stranger, a little bit of sugar, danger\nI'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view\nI do, I do, I do, I do\n[Verse 2]\nI don't remember too much of the last year\nBut I knew who I was when I got here\n'Cause I'm still the same but only entirely different\nAnd my lover’s just some lines in some songs, mm\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou think you’ve read the book I'm still writing\nI can’t imagine wanting so badly to be right\nGuess I'm forever on your mind\nI wonder why\n[Chorus]\nWhat's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me (Tell me)\nI would rather feel everything than nothing every time (Every, every time)\nOoh, fear me, stranger (Stranger), a little bit of sugar (Sugar), danger (Danger)\nI'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view\n[Outro]\nRather be swimming with you than drowning in a crowded room\nI do, I do, I do, I do"
