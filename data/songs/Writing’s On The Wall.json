  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been here before\nBut always hit the floor\nI've spent a lifetime runnin'\nAnd I always get away\nBut with you, I'm feeling somethin'\nThat makes me wanna stay\n[Verse 2]\nI'm prepared for this\nI never shoot to miss\nBut I feel like a storm is comin'\nIf I'm gonna make it through the day\nThen there's no more use in runnin'\nThis is somethin' I gotta face\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I risk it all\nCould you break my fall?\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here, I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me, is this where I give it all up?\nFor you, I have to risk it all\n'Cause the writing's on the wall\n\n[Verse 3]\nA million shards of glass\nThat haunt me from my past\nAs the stars begin to gather\nAnd the light begins to fade\nWhen all hope begins to shatter\nKnow that I won't be afraid\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I risk it all\nCould you break my fall?\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here, I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me, is this where I give it all up?\nFor you, I have to risk it all\n'Cause the writing's on the wall\n[Bridge]\nThe writing's on the wall\n[Chorus]\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here, I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me, is this where I give it all up?\nHow do I live? How do I breathe?\nWhen you're not here, I'm suffocating\nI wanna feel love run through my blood\nTell me, is this where I give it all up?\nFor you, I have to risk it all\n'Cause the writing's on the wall"
