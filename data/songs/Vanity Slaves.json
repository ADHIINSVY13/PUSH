  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry\nSometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie\nSometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride\nSometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe\nSometimes I wwanna bump Tribe and zone out\nThis song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside\nWhen my world collide\nWith your world where your girl and your kids reside\nWe killed the facades, we feel free to fly\nWe're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky\nI care about my pride too much\nIf my clothes is new, if my ride is plush\nIf my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed\nI look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong\nInsecurity roams the black community\nHomes where kids must have jewelry\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt's not about the right price but more like the right scam\nTo rule us all, confuse us all\nHit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw\nNow let's draw\nThe picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for\nMy cousin from the South said he just bought him a house\nThat lives around his neck like a white collar\nSo why fast forward? Then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times\nPickin' cotton from a field that a white man own\nThe blacker you are farther you from the white man's home\nNegro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity\nBefore your vanity, they parted our families\nThey put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed\nThe more we were afraid, the more they made rules\nAnd trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague\nCouldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh\nAnd school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts\nAnd a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar\nFour-hundred years of nothin', four-hundred years of sufferin'\nFour-hundred years of tears and tribulations, miseducation\nSee what we facin' is now comin' back to the roots\nRemember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot\nCalled us niggers and figured that we'd never live in pursuit\nOf happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do\nThought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to\nAbout a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie\nHer hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me\nShe still bad though and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though\nWe fillin' up the gas for Rollies\nUpgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin' Kobes\nMy cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya\nHe overcompensate for the life of his ancestors\nSo blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw\nThe reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss\nSlaves\n\n[Outro]\nI said the four-hundred years we never had nothin'\nBarely had clothes on our back\nIs the reason why when we get a little bit of change\nWe over exaggerate on our livin' expenses\nSo if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house\nYou're a vanity slave\nIf you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger\nFour holes in your left ear and a nose piercin'\nYou're a vanity slave\nIf you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it\nAnd on the back of the window it says, \"Get on my level, ho\"\nYou're a vanity slave\nWe all vanity slaves\nSo with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?\nI'm not from around here, hey, Ali, where we at? Idaho?\nYeah, nigga, you know the first of the month, checks comin' in\nI'm tryna get some\nWhat up?"
