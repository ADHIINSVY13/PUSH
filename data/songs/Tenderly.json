  "lyrics": "Your arms open wide\nClose me inside\nYou took my lips\nYou took my love so tenderly\nThe evening breeze\nCaressed the trees tenderly\nThe trembling trees\nEmbraced the breeze tenderly\nThen you and I\nCame wandering by\nAnd lost\nIn a sigh were we\nThe shore was kissed\nBy sea and mist tenderly\nI can't forget\nHow two hearts met breathlessly\nYour big old arms opened wide\nAnd then closed me, and then closed me inside\nYou took my lips\nYou took my love so tenderly\nThe shore was kissed\nBy sea and mist tenderly\nI can't forget\nHow two hearts met breathlessly\n\nAh, your arms opened wide\nAnd then closed me, and then closed me, closed me inside\nYou took my lips\nOh, you took my, my love so tenderly, so tenderly\nYou took my arms\nAnd wrapped them around you and I\nYou took my lips\nYour arms opened wide\nThen closed me inside\nYou took, you took my lips\nYou took my love so tenderly"
