  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe was a young girl\nMama said to her\nYour daddy's leaving home today\nThink he's gone to stay\nWe packed up all the bags\nAnd drove out to Anchorage\nThey got to Anchorage\nShe checked in to school\nShe wore white Chucks on her feet\nShe learned the golden rule\nThe punches came fast and hard\nLying on her back in the school yard\n[Chorus]\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\n[Verse 2]\nWell pretty soon she met a friend\nShe played guitar\nUsed to sit on the steps at school\nAnd dream of being stars\nThey started a band\nThey played all night\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\n[Verse 3]\nBusinessmen crowded around\nThey came to hear the golden sound\nThere they were on the Sunset Strip\nPlaying their songs for the highest bid\nThey played all night\nThe price was right\n[Chorus]\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\nDon't be denied, don't be denied\n[Verse 4]\nAll that glitters isn't gold\nYou know you heard that story told\nShe's a pauper in a naked disguise\nA millionaire through a businessman's eyes\nOh friend of mine\nDon't be denied"
