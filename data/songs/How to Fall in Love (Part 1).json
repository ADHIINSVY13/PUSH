  "lyrics": "I got a bad sensation\nThe enemy is all around\nThe traces of my naked heart\nAre laid upon the ground\nI suffered side effects\nThat might have been forever\nEven in my dreams\nAnd I was left alone to pray\nWhen there was no one in the way\nAnd nothin' what it seemed\nAnd from a hard time, play time\nTook a trip around the world\nMade myself invisible\nThe taste was in the wine\nAnd just when the thought of someone\nNeeding me forever\nI don't believe the words are true\nThat only she could be my savior\nExperience is not enough\nI'll show you how to fall in love\nShe said experience is not enough\nI'll show you how to fall in love\nAnd she's all alone with me\nEvery night\nAnd lighting all my days of sorrow\nOn my own\nIf there was any more to give\nYou know I'd sacrifice it for her\n\nAnd in the prime of my life\nI was blessed and I was sent\nSomeone sweet and innocent\nAnd nervous when she kissed\nAnd in the face of my\nForbidden fruit forever\nMiracles are mine\nAnd knowing I'm the first\nIn her secret universe\nThere's no sense of space and time\nYou take a small town, young girl\nSomeone warm and wonderful\nThat any man would understand\nThat love is like the wind\nSomething deep inside to give you\nAnd when the words get in the way\nThe only thing you need is silence\nExperience is not enough\nI'll show you how to fall in love\nShe said experience is not enough\nI'll show you how to fall in love"
