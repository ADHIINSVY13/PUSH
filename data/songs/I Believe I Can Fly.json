  "lyrics": "If I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything\nIf I can see it, I can do it\nI used to think that I could not go on\nAnd life was nothing but an awful song\nBut now I know the meaning of true love\nI'm leaning on the everlasting arms\nIf I can see it then I can do it\nIf I just believe it, there's nothing to it\nI believe I could fly\nI believe I can touch the sky\nThink about it every night and day\nSpread my wings and fly away\nI believe, I believe I can soar\nI see me running through that open door\nI believe I can fly, I believe I can fly\nI believe I can fly\nSee I was on the verge of breaking down\nSometimes silence, it can seem so loud\nThere are miracles in life I must achieve\nBut first I know it starts inside of me\n\nIf I can see it, I can do it\nIf I just believe it, there's nothing to it\nI believe I could fly\nI believe I can touch the sky\nI think about it every night and day\nSpread my wings and fly away\nI believe I can soar\nI see me running through that open door\nI believe I can fly, I believe I can fly\nI believe I can fly\n'Cause I believe in me\nI believe in me\nIf I can see it then I can do it\nIf I just, if I just believe it, there's nothing to it\nI believe, I believe I could fly\nI believe I can touch the sky\nThink about it every night and day\nSpread my wings and fly away\nI believe, I believe I can soar\nI see me running through that open door\nI believe I can fly, I believe, I believe\nI believe I can fly and I believe I can fly\n\nI believe I can fly\nI know, I know I can fly\nI know, I know I can soar\nSee me running through that open door\nI, I can fly"
