It appears only on the deluxe edition.\n[Verse 1]\nYou're not her, though I try to see you differently\nI tow the line, you see, I'm searching for what used to be mine\nAnd I saw your eyes and I saw Alice staring back at me\nSo I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've moved far away from you\nAnd I want to see you here beside me, dear\nBut things aren't clear\n[Chorus]\nWhen we never even tried\nWe never even talked\nWe never even thought in the long run\nWhenever it was painful\nWhenever I was away\nI'd miss you\nAnd I miss you\n[Verse 2]\nShe was mine\nI was hers and all that's in-between\nIf she would cry\nI would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've moved far away from you\nAnd I want to see you here beside me, dear\nBut things aren't clear\n[Chorus]\nWe never even tried\nWe never even talked\nWe never even thought in the long run\nWhenever it was painful\nWhenever I was away\nI'd miss you\nAnd I miss you\n[Bridge]\nDon't drop me in, it's not my turn\nIf you cut deep, then I might learn\nThat you scarred and left me like a sunburn\nDon't drop me in, it's not my turn\nAnd if you cut deep, then I might learn\nThat you'll scar and leave me like a sunburn\n[Chorus]\nWe never even tried\nWe never even talked\nWe never even thought in the long run\nWhenever it was painful\nWhenever I was away\nI'd miss you\nAnd I miss you"
