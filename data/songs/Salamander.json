  "lyrics": "Get out of my blood, salamander!\nI can’t seem to blow off enough steam to get you out of my head\nSoul cycle you to death, run you out of my blood to San Pedro\nAnd yet, everywhere I go, it seems there you are,\nAnd there I am\nI don’t want to sell my stories anymore, stop pushing me\nSome stories aren’t meant to be sold\nSome words aren’t meant to be told\nI want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten\nor remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day\nOr by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm after-work hands\nI love you, but you don’t understand me\n, I’m a real poet!\nMy life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy!\nMy thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free\nYou see, the things that can’t be bought can’t be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach\nUntouchable, safe, otherworldy\nUnable to be deciphered or metabolized\nSomething \nmetaphysical\n,\nlike a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window\nA thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal\n\nLike Mount Olympus, where Zeus sent Athena and the rest of the immortals to play"
