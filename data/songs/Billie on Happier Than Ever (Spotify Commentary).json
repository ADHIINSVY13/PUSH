  "artist": "Billie Eilish",
  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"Happier Than Ever\"! Probably the most therapeutic song I've ever written or recorded? Like, ever, ever, ever? 'Cause I just screamed my lungs out and could barely talk afterwards which was very satisfying to me somehow? I had wanted to get those screams out for a very long time. And it was very nice, too."
