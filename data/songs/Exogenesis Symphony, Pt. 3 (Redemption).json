  "lyrics": "The final part of the three-piece work, Exogenesis Symphony, relates the thoughts and innermost feelings of the characters from the first two parts, “Overture” and “Cross Pollination.”\n[Verse]\nLet's start over again\nWhy can't we start it over again?\nJust let us start it over again\nAnd we'll be good\nThis time we'll get it, get it right\nIt's our last chance to forgive ourselves"
