I told you everything, didn't I?\nBut you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved\nYour friends all up in your head even when we're in bed\nYour mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha\nI'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no\nMy back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDon't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down\nWho knows when was the last time you felt the love\nOne last sparkle to follow in my light (Right on)\nOne last sparkle to follow"
