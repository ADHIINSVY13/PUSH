  "lyrics": "It starts off slow\nWith a kiss of folly\nAnd you don't see it\nAs more\nBut after awhile\nWhen all the dogs\nSee you\nSneaking\nIn the back door\nYou don't believe\nWhen they tell you\nYou don't believe\nThen\nA world of trouble\nIs all you see\nNights\nWhen the phone rings\nAnd it's so easy\nTo get up\nAnd go back again\nYou don't stop\nYou don't think\nTo live without it\nKnowing\nThat you'll never win\nYou don't believe\nWhen they tell you\nYou don't believe\n\nThen\nA world of trouble\nIs all you see\nThis is the last time\nOr the beginning\nWhenever you say\nIt's enough\nWhile each day\nEach month\nRolls out behind you\nThe lost time\nIs calling your bluff\nYou don't believe\nWhen they tell you\nYou don't believe\nThen\nA world of trouble\nIs all you see\nA world of trouble\nIs all you need"
