Yeah, right\nMy mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like\nStupid niggas, \nain't heard the cops be shooting niggas\nI swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas\nCan't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas\nWe trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas\n[Chorus 2]\nBreak down, we break down\nWe break down, we break down\nBreak the break down\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, he's serving time, locked down\nAnd she don't want nobody to know\nHis daughter 25 pounds\nBy the time he get out, she gon' be 4\nNow will his girl stay down?\nAin't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure\nBut temptation stays 'round\nAnd if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know\nAnd so, she goes to the club on the weekend\nA little freaking, but them niggas holler, but she never speakin'\nBut tonight I see the devil creeping\n'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons\nDamn! She doin' the best that she can\nHer mama tellin' her to find another man\nShe college educated with a felon boyfriend\nThat's what she thinkin' tonight\nMaybe she's right, but please\n\n[Chorus 3]\nStay down mama\nGotta be strong, don't break down mama\nPlease\nStay down mama\nGotta be strong, don't break down mama\nDon't break down\nYeah, don't break down\nDon't break down\nDon't break down\nUh, break the break down...\n[Outro]\nBreak, break down\nSteady break me down\nBreak, break down\nSteady break me down\nBreak, break down\nSteady break me down\nBreak, break down\nSteady break me down..."
