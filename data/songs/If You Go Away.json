  "lyrics": "If you go away on this summer day\nThen you might as well take the sun away\n;\nAll the birds that flew in the summer sky\nWhen our love was new and \nour hearts were high\n;\nWhen the day was young and the night was long\nAnd the moon stood still for the night bird's song\nIf you go away, if you go away, if you go away\nBut if you stay, I'll make you a day\nLike no day has been, or will be again;\nWe'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain\nWe'll talk to the trees and worship the wind\nThen if you go, I'll understand\nLeave me just enough love to fill up my hand\nIf you go away, if you go away, if you go away\nIf you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning\nTill you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you\nCan I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello\nIf you go away, if you go away, if you go away\nBut if you stay, I'll make you a night\nLike no night has been, or will be again\nI'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch\nI'll talk to your eyes that I love so much\nBut if you go, go, I won't cry\nThough the good is gone from the word goodbye\nIf you go away, if you go away, if you go away\nIf you go away, as I know you must\nThere'll be nothing left in the world to trust\nJust an empty room, full of empty space\nLike the empty look I see on your face\nI'd have been the shadow of your shadow\nIf I thought it might have kept me by your side\nIf you go away, if you go away, if you go away\nPlease don't go away"
