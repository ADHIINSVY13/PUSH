Do I love her?\nDon't you know I do\n[Verse 1]\nMrs. Jones won't you put my darling on the phone\nLet me tell her\nI shouldn't have left her\n'Cause I love her just as long as\nBees love honey\nBanks love money\nBirdies love to fly\nLittle Jack Horner in the corner loves his Christmas pie\nMrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones\nLet me speak to your daughter\nIf she gives me one more chance\nI'm gonna love her like I oughta\n[Bridge]\nI can't forget (I can't forget)\nThat lacy dress\nThat she used to wear for me\nWe'd sit under the apple tree\nAnd I remember (I remember, I remember) that night in September\nWhen my baby cried and cried 'cause they told her love has died\n\n[Chorus]\nDo I love her? Do I love her?\nWith a heart that's true\nDo I love her? Do I love her?\nI swear I do\n[Verse 2]\nI'm ashamed, I'm ashamed\nFor stringing her along\nLike a playboy with a play toy\nAnd she loved me just as strong as\nBees love honey\nBanks love money\nBirdies love to fly (Birdies love to fly)\nLittle Miss Muffet loves her tuffet\nBabies love to cry (Babies love to cry)\nMrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones\nPlease don't hang up that receiver\nIf she heard one sweet word\nShe'd know I would never leave her\n[Bridge]\nBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby\nShe's the best\nOh, the very best\nEverything worth living for\nEverything that I adore\n\n[Outro]\nDo I love her? Do I love her?\nWith a heart that's true\nDo I love her? Do I love her?\nI swear I do\nAs much as bees love honey\nBanks love money\nBirdies love to fly\nDo I love her? Oh yeah\nWill I love her? Baby, woo, woo, yeah\nI love my baby\nI love her"
