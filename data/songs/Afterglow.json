  "lyrics": "[Intro]\n(One, two)\n[Verse 1]\nStop the clocks, it's amazing\nYou should see the way the light dances off your hair\nA million colours of hazel, golden, and red\nSaturday morning is fading\nThe sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand\nMy eyes are caught in your gaze all over again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle\nTryna find ourselves in the winter snow\nSo alone in love like the world had disappeared\nOh, I won't be silent and I won't let go\nI will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow\nAnd we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears\n[Chorus]\nOh, I will hold on to the afterglow\nOh, I will hold on to the afterglow\n[Verse 2]\nThe weather outside's changing\nThe leaves are buried under six inches of white\nThe radio is playing Iron & Wine\nThis is a new dimension\nThis is a level where we're losing track of time\nI'm holding nothing against it, except you and I\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle\nTryna find ourselves in the winter snow\nSo alone in love like the world had disappeared\nOh, I won't be silent and I won't let go\nI will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow\nAnd we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears\n[Chorus]\nOh, I will hold on to the afterglow\nOh, I will hold on to the afterglow\nOh, I will hold on to the afterglow"
