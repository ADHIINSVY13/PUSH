(Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n[Verse 2]\nTrying my best to show appreciation, oh yeah\nBut all apologies are just a miscommunication\nNow it’s like I’m walking on eggshells\nTrying not to burn the hell out\nIt’s like pulling magic from my mouth\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat’s when she said\nThat’s when she said\n[Chorus]\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n[Bridge]\nCould I ever do enough to make this coffee more than bitter water?\nCould I ever do enough to make you wear this love not like a collar?\nCould I ever do enough to make you feel the way you want to feel?\nSo the next time that you’re sad, tell me that…\n[Chorus]\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nUh yeah, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable?  (Oh-oh)\nAre you just comfortable? Oh"
