Ayy\nLately, all I want is you on top of me\nYou know where your hands should be\nSo, baby, won't you come show me? Mm\nI got you, I got you dreamin' (Ah)\nYou close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ah)\nPlay with your mind for no reason\nI know you love how I tease it (Ah-ah)\nYou know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken\nYou already know what I'm thinkin', boy\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, why'd you have to be so cute?\nIt's impossible to ignore you, woah\nWhy must you make me laugh so much?\nIt's bad enough we get along so well\n[Chorus]\nJust say goodnight and go\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nJust say goodnight and go\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nJust say goodnight and go\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne of these days\nYou'll miss your train and come stay with me\n(It's always say goodnight and go)\nWe'll have drinks and talk about things\nAnd any excuse to stay awake with you\nAnd you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there\nBut then the heating may be down again\n(At my convenience)\nWe'd be good, we'd be great together\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy'd you have to be so cute?\nIt's impossible to ignore you, woah\nWhy must you make me laugh so much?\nIt's bad enough we get along so well\n[Chorus]\nJust say goodnight and go\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nJust say goodnight and go (I know how you want it, baby, just like this)\nOoh (Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss)\nOoh (While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips)\nOoh (I know what you want, but you can't have this)\n[Bridge]\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\nDa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da\n\n[Outro]\nWanna say goodnight\nWanna say goodnight and go\nWanna say goodnight\nBaby, say goodnight and go\nWanna say goodnight\nSay goodnight and go"
