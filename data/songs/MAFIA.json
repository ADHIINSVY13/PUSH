I had a lot to achieve\nBlew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieved\nRather you leave, then you go back out on me\nDon't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least\nYou know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week\nMovin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet\nWe got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nFuck shit up at the club, shit tucked\nWe be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck\nBack up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck\nCity up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, front, trust\n[Verse 2: Travis Scott]\nLike it thick with a bounce, we all in the count\nWine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave\nStacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house\nYou come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'\nThen Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)\nStep by step, watch yourself\nCleaners got anything you might've left\nI couldn't do none of this by myself\nWith mafia, they in the tuck\nI gave you fifty to boost up your butt\nI gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed\nI tried to choose you, you'd rather go club\nKnow what to do, you rattled me up\nCommon denominator,\n we were steps from the diamond ages\nGot a couple of vibrations\nFor the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration\n\n[Chorus: J. Cole & \nTravis Scott\n]\nFuck shit up at the club, shit tucked\n (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)\nWe be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck\n (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)\nBack up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck\n (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)\nCity up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, front, trust\n (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)\n[Interlude: Travis Scott]\nMm, mm, woah-ah, mm-mm\nWoah, mm-mm, mm-mm\nFuck shit up at the club\n (Ooh)\nYeah, yeah\nDrop down (Run)\nHorse around, horse around\n[Chorus: J. Cole & \nTravis Scott\n]\nFuck shit up at the club, shit tucked\n (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)\nWe be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck\n (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)\nBack up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck\n (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)\nCity up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, front, trust\n (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)"
