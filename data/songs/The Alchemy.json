He just comes runnin' over to me\n[Chorus]\nTouchdown\nCall the amateurs and cut 'em from the team\nDitch the clowns, get the crown\nBaby, I'm the one to beat\n'Cause the sign on your heart\nSaid it's still reserved for me\nHonestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?\nThese blokes warm the benches\nWe've been on a winning streak\nHe jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an \"E\"\n'Cause the sign on your heart\nSaid it's still reserved for me\nHonestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?\n\n[Outro]\nThis happens once every few lifetimes\nThese chemicals hit me like white wine"
