  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nOn a clear day, rise and look around you\nAnd you'll see who - just who you are\nOn a clear day, how it will astound you\nThat the glow of your being outshines every star\nYou feel part of every mountain, sea, and shore\nYou can hear from far and near a world you've never heard before\nAnd on a clear, on that clear day\nYou can see forevermore\n[Outro]\nAnd on that-a clear, on that clear, clear day\nYou can see forever and ever and ever\nAnd evermore"
