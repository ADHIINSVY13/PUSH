(Gon' defend you likе an army)\nAnd never let go? (Never let go)\nYeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)\nSomebody to wake up to when everyone's gone\nSo if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)\nI'll be the shoulder you cry on\n[Post-Chorus]\nEverybody needs some–\nEverybody needs somebody\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star\nIt's the way you light up every room just bein' who you are\nDidn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you, ooh-woah)\nBut before I met you, I never believed in magic\nBut you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it\nI know (Yeah, yeah), that you know (Yeah, yeah), what we got, it don't come easy\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave\nWhen I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day\n[Chorus]\nEverybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)\nSomebody to remind you that you're not alone\nWho gon' defend you like an army? (Gon' defend you like an army)\nAnd never let go? (Never let go)\nYeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)\nSomebody to wake up to when everyone's gone\nSo if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)\nI'll be the shoulder you cry on\n[Post-Chorus]\nEverybody needs some–\nEverybody needs somebody"
