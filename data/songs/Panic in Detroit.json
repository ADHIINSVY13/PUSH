  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe looked a lot like Che Guevara\nDrove a diesel van\nKept his gun in quiet seclusion\nSuch a humble man\nThe only survivor of the National People's Gang\n[Chorus]\nPanic in Detroit\nI asked for an autograph\nHe wanted to stay home\nI wish someone would phone\nPanic in Detroit\n[Verse 2]\nHe laughed at accidental sirens\nThat broke the evening gloom\nThe police had warned of repercussions\nThey followed none too soon\nA trickle of strangers were all that were left alive\n[Chorus]\nPanic in Detroit\nI asked for an autograph\nHe wanted to stay home\nI wish someone would phone\nPanic in Detroit\n\n[Bridge]\nPutting on some clothes, I made my way to school\nAnd I found my teacher crouching in his overalls\nI screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine\nAnd jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights\n[Verse 3]\nHaving scored a trillion dollars\nMade a run back home\nFound him slumped across the table\nA gun and me alone\nI ran to the window, looked for a plane or two\n[Chorus]\nPanic in Detroit\nHe'd left me an autograph\n\"Let me collect dust.\"\nI wish someone would phone\nPanic in Detroit\nPanic in Detroit"
