  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's quarter to three\nThere's no one in the place, 'cept you and me\nSo set 'em up, Joe\nI got a little story I think you should know\n[Chorus]\nWe're drinkin' my friend\nTo the end of a brief episode\nMake it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\n[Verse 2]\nI got the routine\nPut another nickel in the machine\nFeelin' so bad\nCan't you make the music easy and sad?\n[Chorus]\nI could tell you a lot\nBut you've gotta be true to your code\nJust make it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\n[Bridge]\nYou'd never know it\nBut buddy, I'm a kind of poet\nAnd I got a lot of things I'd like to say\nAnd when I'm gloomy\nWon't you listen to me\n'Til it's talked away?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, that's how it goes\nAnd, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close\nAnd thanks for the cheer\nI hope you didn't mind my bending your ear\n[Chorus]\nBut this torch that I've found\nIt's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode\nSo make it one for my baby\nAnd one more for the road\n[Outro]\nThe long\nIt's so long\nThe long\nVery long"
