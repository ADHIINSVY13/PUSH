  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"Billie Bossa Nova\" 's a little bit of a... fantasy... I don't even know what. We actually called this song \"Billie Bossa Nova\" because in... I wanna say like spring of 2019, my brother sent me a beat that he had made and he called it \"Billie Bossa Nova\" 'cause it was just a Bossa Nova type beat, and I was like \"that's amazing,\" and then, nothing happened for like a year and a half, um... and then... we listened to it again and kind of wrote this fantasy, romanticized, glorified dream."
