  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhile you're fast asleep\n[Verse 1]\nDo you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? \nThe idea that someone else can control your thoughts.\n \nFeeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts.\n Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. \nFeeling afraid in open spaces or in public.\n \nThoughts of ending your life.\n \nFeeling that most people could not be trusted.\n Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?\n[Chorus]\nI feel like this\nI feel like this\nI feel like that\nI feel like this all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\n[Verse 2]\nDo you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control?\n Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. \nAre your feelings easily hurt?\n \nFeeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?\n[Chorus]\nI feel like that all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\n\n[Verse 3]\nDo you have trouble falling asleep?\n Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling in parts of your body, trouble catchin' your breath?\n[Chorus]\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time"
