  "lyrics": "Lovers in ancient times\nNow it begins -- I see it in your eyes\nAnd I know how you feel -- you long to touch the sky\nThe flame of life, let it eat your heart out every night\nBut you're not alone\nThis is your world -- this is your world\nLovers in ancient time, caught in the fire\nOnly the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow\nLive an illusion, don't let it fade and die\nSomething deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you\nSomething deep inside you\nSomething deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you\nSomething deep inside you\nSpoken:\nGo now, girl, don't look back. this is your one big chance\nI place my fingers to your lips and I tell you my love flies with you\nOn a wing and a prayer, on a wing and a prayer\nNo muscle and bone -- rhythm is the key\nThere's everything to play for -- you're everything to me\nThe game of life -- win it and your love comes tumbling down\nYou'll never be alone\nThis is your world -- this is your world\n\nThis is your world -- this is your world\nLovers in ancient time, caught in the fire\nOnly the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow\nLive an illusion, don't let it fade and die\nSomething deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you\nSomething deep inside you\nSomething deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you\nSomething deep inside you\nSomething deep inside you, a wing and a prayer will guide you\nSomething deep inside you"
