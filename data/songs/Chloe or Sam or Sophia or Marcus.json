  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYour hologram stumbled into my apartment\nHands in the hair of somebody in darkness\nNamed Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\nAnd I just watched it happen\nAs the decade would play us for fools\nAnd you saw my bones out with somebody new\nWho seemed like he would've bullied you in school\nAnd you just watched it happen\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanna break my cold, cold heart\nJust say, \"I loved you the way that you were\"\nIf you wanna tear my world apart\nJust say you've always wondered\n[Verse 2]\nYou said some things that I can't unabsorb\nYou turned me into an idea of sorts\nYou needed me, but you needed drugs more\nAnd I couldn't watch it happen\nI changed into goddesses, villains, and fools\nChanged plans and lovers and outfits and rules\nAll to outrun my desertion of you\nAnd you just watched it\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanna break \nmy cold, cold heart\nJust say, \"I loved you the way that you were\"\nIf you wanna tear my world apart\nJust say you've always wondered\n[Bridge]\nIf the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh\nDown that passage in time back to the moment\nI crashed into you, like so many wrecks do\nToo impaired by my youth to know what to do\n[Verse 3]\nSo if I sell my apartment\nAnd you have some kids with an internet starlet\nWill that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon\nLike it never happened?\nCould it be enough to just float in your orbit?\nCan we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?\nCooler in theory, but not if you force it to be\nIt just didn't happen\n[Chorus]\nSo if you wanna break my cold, cold heart\nSay you loved me\nAnd if you wanna tear my world apart\nSay you'll always wonder\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause I wonder\nWill I always\nWill I always wonder?"
