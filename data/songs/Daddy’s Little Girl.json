Cole]\nHey, her mind is on a different level\nPlus, the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel\nHit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil\nShe fuck, she suck, she swallow, man, it's like a triple double\nCan see it in your eyes, you look for trouble\nJust because they fuck ya, girl, don't mean them niggas love ya\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe said, \"Don't preach to me nigga, hold up\nIs that a bottle on your table? Well, if so, then pour it up\"\n\"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up\"\nShe said, \"Daddy, what you think?\"\n\"Little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up\"\nHey, take a couple of shots and it's on\n\"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up\"\nShe said, \"Daddy, what you think?\"\n\"Little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up\"\nHey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song\n[Chorus]\nMama couldn't never reach her\nBrother tried his best to teach her\nShe thinks she's ready for the world\nJust look at daddy's little girl\nMama couldn't never reach her\nBrother tried his best to teach her\nShe thinks she's ready for the world\nJust look at daddy's little girl\nDaddy's little girl, daddy's little girl\nShe's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl\nDaddy's little girl\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nCan I get a witness? \nThis is Sade mixed with Shawty Lo\nEy, Jezebel, why you be up in every party fo'?\nYou lost and lookin' for a savior? I ain't Mario\nI got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio\nWork you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter, though\nMake me wonder, where your father go?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe said, \"Don't analyze me, nigga, hold up\nIs that green on your table? Well, if so, then roll it up\nI can take it to the face without even throwin' up\"\nShe said, \"Daddy, what you think?\"\n \n\"Little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up\"\nHey, and blow a couple sacks and she gone\nSaid, \"I can take it to the face without even throwin' up\"\nShe said, \"Daddy, what you think?\"\n\"Little girl, you're growin' up, growin' up\"\nHey, listen, baby girl, they playin' your song\n[Chorus]\nMama couldn't never reach her\nBrother tried his best to teach her\nShe thinks she's ready for the world\nJust look at daddy's little girl\nMama couldn't never reach her\nBrother tried his best to teach her\nShe thinks she's ready for the world\nJust look at daddy's little girl\nMama couldn't never reach her\nBrother tried his best to teach her\nShe thinks she's ready for the world\nJust look at daddy's little girl\nDaddy's little girl, daddy's little girl\nShe's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl\nDaddy's little girl"
