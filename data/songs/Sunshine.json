  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOnly love will save you this time\nHopelessly fighting to escape your mind\nAnd nobody can help you\nIn this foreign land where loneliness can keep you down\n[Chorus]\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little more\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little more\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little morе\nSunshine, you make me feel alivе\n[Verse 2]\nIn my eyes, nothing is equal to your grace\nLiving honestly can teach you about pain\nWhat are you living for? Purpose or blame?\nAs long as there's tomorrow\nThe sun will rise again\n[Chorus]\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little more\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little more\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little more\nSunshine, you make me feel alive\nLittle more, little more, just a little more\n\n[Outro]\nThe sun, you make me feel alive, that's why\n(Little more, little more, just a little more)\nYou are my sun, you help me heal inside (Sunshine, you make me feel alive)\n(Little more, little more, just a little more)\nJust smile (Sunshine, you make me feel alive)\nAnd you will be surprised\n(Little more, little more, just a little more)\nThat's why the sun always feels alive (Sunshine, you make me feel alive)\nLittle more, little more, just a little more"
