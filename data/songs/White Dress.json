Oh, no, that's a shame\nWeddin' in June, what could be better?\nLet's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever\nTake the very last car of the Eurostar\nTell the conductor, \"Just drive so far\"\nTold some of your friends and they wasn't excited?\nWell, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited\nWe will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fightin'\nTell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited\nLet's make a move from these herds, go somewhere private\nI'm talkin' just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nJust me and you, girl\nWoah-oh\nJust me and you, girl\nWoah-oh"
