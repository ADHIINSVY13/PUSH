(\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (\nOh\n)\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (\nOh\n)\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago\nMercy, mercy me, that Murci√©lago\nThat's me the first year that I blow\nHow you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo\nMe drown sorrow in that Diablo\nMe found bravery in my bravado\nDJs need to listen to the models\nYou ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (\nYou ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?\n)\nStupid, but what the hell do I know?\nI'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow\nAnd my chick in that new Phoebe Philo\nSo much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher?\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nLook like a fat booty Celine Dion\nSex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis\nBeyond the truest\nHey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?\nAnd refresh the page and restart the memory?\nRe-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?\nWe stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy\nSorry for the night demons that still visit me\nThe plan was to drink until the pain over\nBut what's worse, the pain or the hangover?\nFresh air, rollin' down the window\nToo many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low\nDon't make me pull the toys out, huh\nDon't make me pull the toys\nAnd fire up the engines, huh\nAnd then they make noise\n\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & \nTeyana Taylor\n]\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\n[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]\nAt the mall, there was a seance\nJust kids, no parents\nThen the sky filled with herons\nSaw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron\nAnd the hell, it wouldn't spare us\nAnd the fires did declare us\nBut after that, took pills, kissed an heiress\nAnd woke up back in Paris\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh\n[Chorus: Justin Vernon & \nTeyana Taylor\n]\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (\nOh\n)\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh (\nOh\n)\nCan we get much higher? (\nSo high\n)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh"
