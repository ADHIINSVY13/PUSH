(C'mon!)\n[Bridge]\nThe ogre men are still inside\nThe two-way mirror mountain\nGotta keep down right out of sight\nYou can't see in, but they can see out\n\"Ooh, keep a lookout!\"\nThe ogre men are coming out\nFrom the two-way mirror mountain\nThey're running up behind and they're coming all about\nCan't go east 'cause you gotta go south\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 3]\nOgre men are going home\nAnd the great big fight is over\nBugle blow, let trumpet cry\nOgre battle lives for ever more\n\n[Bridge]\nOh-oh-oh, you can come along\nYou can come along\nCome to ogre battle\n[Outro]\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ahh!"
