No matter what you do, people change over time, so just be yourself.\n[Intro: Lykke Li]\nWatch my back, so I make sure\nYou're right behind me as before\nYesterday, the night before tomorrow\nDry my eyes so you won't know\nDry my eyes so I won't show\nI know you're right behind me...\n[Chorus: Lykke Li]\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\n[Verse 1: Logic]\nYeah, I know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together\nThought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather\nI think about you and imagine a house and some kids\nAnd wonder if you found another and it's all his\nSee, baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies\n'Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes\nSometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it\n'Cause you try your hardest to run\nBut still feel me in your spirit, baby girl, I know you hear it\nMy heart is calling for you tonight\nAnd even though the time is wrong I know the love is right\nThat's why there's so much emotion whenever I recite\nAnything about this angel that lost its sight\nBaby, you were my everything, but you playin' games\nFucking around got me feeling like blowin' my brains\nBut you ain't worth the satisfaction\n'Cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action\nI used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them\n\n[Chorus: Lykke Li]\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nYou were my best friend but then you out me\nI never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me\nSo in the end, it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me\nI know you hearing the emotion that's deep within this letter\nBut I don't give a shit about what you think\nI write it so that the people can feel better\nThat have gone through what I've gone through\nMemories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you\nAnd if you think I write this song to taunt you\nI don't want you\nI want the memory of who you were\nAnd what it was to wake up everyday\nAnd have an endless love with an angel from up above\nBut now it would seem my baby girl has fallen\nAnd another path within my life is calling\n'\nCause I put everything below you (Everything below you)\nEven my music, and when you left me, I didn't lose it\nI channeled deep within my emotions and used it\nMy heart you broke it and bruised it\nSo now I address this microphone and just ooze it\n\n[Chorus: Lykke Li]\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\nDon't you let me go, let me go tonight\n[Outro: Lykke Li]\nWatch my back, so I make sure\nYou're right behind me as before\nYesterday, the night before tomorrow\nDry my eyes so you won't know\nDry my eyes so I won't show\nI know you're right behind me..."
