Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?\n[Verse 2]\nThird floor on the West Side, me and you\nHandsome, you're a mansion with a view\nDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\nLong night with your hands up in my hair\nEchoes of your footsteps on the stairs\nStay here, honey, I don't wanna share\n[Pre-Chorus]\n('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\nYou must like me for me\n(Yeah, I want you) We can't make\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\nBut you can make me a drink\n[Chorus]\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?\n[Bridge]\nSometimes, I wonder, when you sleep\nAre you ever dreaming of me?\nSometimes, when I look into your eyes\nI pretend you're mine all the damn time\n[Chorus]\n('Cause I like you)\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\n(Yeah, I want you)\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\n('Cause I like you)\nIs it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)\nIs it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (Isn't it delicate?)\n(Yeah, I want you)\nIs it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)\nIs it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\nIsn't it delicate?"
