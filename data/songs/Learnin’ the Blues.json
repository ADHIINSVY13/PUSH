  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe tables are empty\nThe dance floor's deserted\nYou play the same love song\nIt's the 10th time you've heard it\n[Chorus]\nThat's the beginning\nJust one of the clues\nYou've had your first lesson\nIn learnin' the blues\n[Verse 2]\nThe cigarettes you light\nOne after another\nWon't help you forget her\nAnd the way that you love her\n[Chorus]\nYou're only burnin'\nA torch you can't lose\nBut you're on the right track\nFor learnin' the blues\n[Verse 3]\nWhen you're at home alone\nThe blues will taunt you constantly\nWhen you're out in a crowd\nThe blues will haunt your memory\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe nights when you don't sleep\nThe whole night you're crying\nBut you can't forget her\nSoon you even stop trying\n[Chorus]\nYou'll walk that floor\nAnd wear out your shoes\nWhen you feel your heart break\nYou're learnin' the blues\n[Bridge]\nWhen you're at home alone\nThe blues will taunt you constantly\nWhen you're out in a crowd\nThose blues will haunt your memory\n[Verse 4]\nThe nights when you don't sleep\nThat whole night you're crying\nBut you can't forget her\nSoon you even stop trying\n[Chorus]\nYou'll walk the floor\nAnd you'll wear out your shoes\nWhen you feel your heart break\nYou're learnin' those blues"
