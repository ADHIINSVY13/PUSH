That’s random\nSee the signs, cut the nigga short, That’s cancer\nKill him then kiss his mama﻿ cheek, That’s manners\n\n[Chorus]\nTony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana\nCheck up out my ears\nTony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana\nI’m ’bout to cop the Porsche\nTony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana\nYou leave me no choice, take em to\nTony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana"
