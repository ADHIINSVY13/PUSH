Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth\nLucious, Luâ€” Lucious\nSir Lucious Left Foot\nHas just entered\n[Chorus: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nFirst rule in this thang, never let 'em see you sweat\nNever let 'em be a threat, and your feelings you must protect 'em\nAs well as your rectum\n, must keep self out of harm\nOut of danger's way, \nlet strangers play while you graduate and move on\nTrue happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale\nUnless you're in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail\nYou would be happy as hell, you thought you was happy until that court date came\nCouldn't abort that case\n, nobody to take your place\nFamily home is at stake, too late to escape and get on the run\n\n[Chorus: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\n[Verse 2: Big Boi, \nSleepy Brown\n & \nDebra Killings\n]\nOnce upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child\nFlip that smile upside down now\nWhen I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli\nIt was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny\nDidn't have many, but had enough to get by\nEnough to get fly, only to start the New Year off in debt\nNow you forget your happiness came and went\nLike mom and dad's relationship, take a trip, you bring potato chips\nI'll bring the hot sauce (\nHot sauce\n)\n[Chorus: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown]\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi & \nDebra Killings\n]\n1979, Dirty South, local lounge\nFlip that smile upside down now\nI never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness\nNow what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit\nGraphic language, mild violence and the silence\nOf the the fams\n, no members to remember\nBut I know just who I am, I've grown into a man\nAnd like my nigga said, we executed the game plan\n'Cause we got that \nhot sauce\n[Chorus: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown, \nDebra Killings\n]\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked (\nFlip that smile upside down now\n)\n[Outro: Debra Killings & Sleepy Brown, \nDebra Killings\n]\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked (\nFlip that smile upside down now\n)\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done\nAnd your goose is cooked (\nFlip that smile upside down now\n)\nMight as well have fun, 'cause your happiness is done"
