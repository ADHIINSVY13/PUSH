  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I was seventeen\nIt was a very good year\nIt was a very good year for small town girls\nAnd soft summer nights\nWe'd hide from the lights\nOn the village green\nWhen I was seventeen\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I was twenty-one\nIt was a very good year\nIt was a very good year for city girls\nWho lived up the stair\nWith all that perfumed hair\nAnd it \ncame undone\nWhen I was twenty-one\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I was thirty-five\nIt was a very good year\nIt was a very good year for blue-blooded girls\nOf independent means\nWe'd ride in limousines\nTheir chauffeurs would drive\nWhen I was thirty-five\n\n[Verse 4]\nBut now the days are short\nI'm in the autumn of the year\nAnd now I think of my life as vintage wine\nFrom fine old kegs\nFrom the brim to the dregs\nIt poured sweet and clear\nIt was a very good year"
