I have a suggestion to make\nIt'll be very easy and smart on my part to, um, you know, I could just pick you up on the way\nIt'll be pretty easy\nIt's, you know, just right, right on the way\nYou know, I can make a detour probably\nWon't be too much of a trouble but, you know, It'll be a smarter decision\nI think, yeah, you should follow, yeah, I can pick you up on my, on the way"
