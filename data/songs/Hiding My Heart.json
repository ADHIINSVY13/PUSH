  "lyrics": "This song (sung originally by Brandi Carlile) is a cover Adele made for “21”, even though it is not in the standard version of the album.\n[Verse 1]\nThis is how the story went\nI met someone by accident\nWho blew me away\nBlew me away\nAnd it was in the darkest of my days\nWhen you took my sorrow and you took my pain\nAnd buried them away\nBuried them away\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\nBut like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day\nSo I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away\n[Verse 2]\nDropped you off at the train station\nPut a kiss on top of your head\nWatched you wave\nWatched you wave\nThen I went on home to my skyscrapers\nAnd neon lights and waiting papers\nThat I call home\nI call that home\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\nBut like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day\nSo I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away\n[Verse 3]\nWoke up feeling heavyhearted\nI'm going back to where I started\nThe morning rain\nThe morning rain\nAnd though I wish that you were here\nOn that same old road that brought me here\nIt's calling me home\nIt's calling me home\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\nBut like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day\nSo I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away\nI can spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
