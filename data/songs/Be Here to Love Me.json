  "lyrics": "Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine\nThough you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine\nThat's got you to feeling this way\nBut I don't care, I want you to stay\nJust hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today\nChildren are dancin', the gamblers are chancin' their all\nThe window's accusing the door of abusing the wall\nBut who cares what the night watchmen say?\nThe stage has been set for the play\nSo just hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today\nThe moon's come and gone, but a few stars hang on to the sky\nWell, the wind's runnin' free, but it ain't up to me ask why\nThe poets are demanding their pay\nAnd they've left me with nothin' to say\nExcept hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today\nJust hold me and tell me that you'll be here to love me today"
