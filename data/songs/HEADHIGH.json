(Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nFatherless, I do act so fatherless\nExcept that's not actin', actually, I lack some confidence\nThey draggin' my name through the web, they should call me Spider-Bitch\nYou got no designer, you gotta take care your mom and them\nYou work nine-to-fives and you still managin' to comment this?\nFuck is your problem, bitch? I know you ain't proud of this\nDeep down, you just wish you didn't feel stuck in the life you live\nDeep down, you got power to change the view they assigned you with\nLost faith in humanity, also lost some common sense\nAlso lost the motivation to begin to find the shit\nI won't take it personally 'cause I get addicted as well\nHard to wish enemies well\nThat's how the internet feel\nHard to hold my—\n[Outro]\nNow I hold my head high (Hard to hold my head high)\nCan you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)\nNow I hold my head high (Hard to hold my head high)\nCan you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)\nNow I hold my head high (Hard to hold my head high)\nCan you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)\nNow I hold my head high (Hard to hold my head high)\nCan you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)"
