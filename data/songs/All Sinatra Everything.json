(\nSinatra, shot ya, goddamn you\n)\nI don't give a fuck how nasty niggas get (\nNah, son\n)\nLet me tell these niggas somethin', God\nI don't want niggas soundin' like me on no album\nKeep it real, get your own shit, man, and be original\n(Word up, you dig?) \nThat's all, man\n (You'll be a better man)\nAnd-and you gon'-you gon' come out on your own way\n (\nYeah\n)\nWhatever how you gon' take it\n (\nYeah\n), \nman, fuck it\n (Word up)\n \nRat Pack niggas\n[Verse 1: Logic]\nAyo, I force MCs to bleed, retreat and recede\nThat's the Young Sinatra creed, killin' a track with incredible speed\nAnd doin' it like it's nothin', no bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though\nSlice MCs like Kato,\n \ngot your head spinnin' like dreidel\nAssassinate 'em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze\nGettin' cheddar at negative thirty degrees\nI'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yen\nBlow it, then spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end\n \nRat Pack niggas\nCan't comprehend what I got goin'\nNever knowin' when Logic flowin' 'cause I'm creepin'\nLike ether the way that I seep in\nSwimmin' in women like the deep end\nChillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like Aretha, uh, now\nSinatra said the best revenge is massive success\nI guess that's women and multiple digits in excess\nYour family broke bread, but my family's bread was soggy\n'Til my brothers broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi\nNow what the fuck\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nBring it on if you think you can hang\nI'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nYou are watching a master at work\n)\n(Yeah) \nYeah, bring it on if you think—\nYeah, uh, yeah (\nLogic\n), yeah\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nAll of a sudden, I feel the inner killer emergin'\nNever splurgin', bingin' money and never purgin'\nUrgin' women to fuck on the rug 'cause it's imported Persian\nThen bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon now\nIt's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle\nOne moment they cool as Stefan, then flip it like Urkel\nOr flip it like keys, yeah, they flip it like ki's\nFrom drug lords overseas that export it with ease\nBitch, please, we stack cheese so old, it's mold\nI'm 'bout that money, so excuse me if my heart is cold\nThe magnum deployed, then I destroy mattresses\nLate night love affairs with New York City actresses\n \n(\nRat Pack niggas\n)\n, \nI\nBroke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages\nVisionary takin' over regardless of our ages\nMakin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow\nThe industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow, but I'm\nPlayin' for keeps, in other words, no need to borrow\nSo you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances\nDon't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream\nAs long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team\nAnd now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas\nTellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous\nNow what the fuck\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nBring it on if you think you can hang\nI'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nYou are watching a master at work\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think—\nYeah, motherfucker (\nLogic\n)\n[Verse 3: Logic]\nTherefore you're never mourn like a memory repressed\nMCs digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed\nOne to the dome, two to the chest\nIf by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless\nI'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel\nPleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game\nI got haters in fifty-seven languages\nWatch me vanquish this, the come up\nBust quicker than .357 caliber\nSharp as Excalibur, crushin' motherfuckers like Gallagher now\nTime is money, somethin' you can never recoup\nSo stop wastin' mine, hit rewind, and then fuckin' regroup\nNever messed with them chicken heads but catch me in the coupé\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nNever in public 'cause I'm a studio fiend\nRockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream now\nAllow me to give you the scoop, shit, I'll make it a double\nI came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble\nMurderers and drug dealers, I knew it, no rebuttal\nAin't no need to claim it, picked up the heat but never aimed it now\nJay gave us \nThe Blueprint\n, I laid the foundation\nTell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration\n'Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations\nI'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business\nGet wit' this, best witness \nlike Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'\nWalk in the spot and all these haters go for the dap and\nI never carried 'em, kill 'em with kindness, then bury 'em, yeah\nI was born with talent, God gave me the gift\nAnd now I pull more strings than guitar riffs\nWhat the fuck\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nBring it on if you think you can hang\nI'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nRat Pack niggas\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not, then let me do my thing\n (\nYou are watching a master at work\n)\nYeah, bring it on if you think—\n(Now that's all Sinatra everything)\n[Outro: Logic]\nSinatra\nRat Pack niggas\nYoung Sinatra\nEast Coast flow at its finest"
