  "lyrics": "My love is ever you, my love\nNow and forever, you my love\nYou walked into my lonely world\nWhat peace of mind your smile unfurled\nYes, and because of you, my love\nMy wishful dreams came true, my love\nIn my uncertain heart, I am only certain of\nHow much I love you, my love\nIn my uncertain heart, I am only certain of\nHow much I love you, my love"
