  "lyrics": "Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to 2Pac\n. \nPeople either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did.\n \nBut whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\nMy favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper.\n \nThat's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space.\n \nEverybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\n2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. \"Hail Mary\" is just perfect:\n \n\"Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted.\" Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that,\n \nor honest enough to write a line like, \"I ain't a killer but don't push me.\"\n \nThese days rappers will just tell you, \"I'll kill you.\"\n2Pac was like a camera. It's incredible how much he wrote — how much he documented. \nTo me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper\n. \nYou can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse.\n \nHe wrote those lyrics without any music.\n Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven — I'm sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music — but 'Pac was just hashing out his life. \nThe thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that's when things got out of control.\nAll of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac.\n \nThe music was all that mattered\n. \nThat East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef.\n \nNow that he's not here, he's bigger than ever.\n \nI can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight.\n \nSometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\nLaurence Fishburne\n told me once that he didn't like 2Pac. \nHe told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn't like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better.\n I understood what he meant. But I still gave him a look like he was bugging."
