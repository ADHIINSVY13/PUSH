  "lyrics": "That old black magic has me in its spell\nThat old black magic that you weave so well\nThose icy fingers up and down my spine\nThe same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine\nThe same old tingle that I feel inside\nAnd then that elevator starts it's slide\nDown and down I go\nRound and round I go\nLike a leaf that's caught in the tide\nI should stay away but what can I do\nI hear your name, and I'm aflame\nA flame with such a burning desire\nThat only your kiss can put out the fire\n'Cause you're the lover I have waited for\nThe mate that fate had me created for\nAnd every time your lips meet mine\nDarling, down and down I go\nRound and round I go\nIn that spin of love that I am in\nUnder that old black magic of love"
