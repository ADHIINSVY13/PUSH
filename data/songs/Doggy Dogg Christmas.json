It must be\nStuffed crust cheese (\nOh, cheese\n)\nTrust me, I keep it poppin' like the hot jerk chicken that I got in my stockin'\n[Chorus]\nHappy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas\nLotta treats to complete on the wishlist\nWhatever the venue, hit up the menu\n(\nDid somebody say, Just Eat?\n)\nTell Santa I ain't ask twice\nEverything I order, both naughty and nice\nWhatever the venue, hit up the menu\n(\nDid somebody say, Just Eat?\n)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAin't nothin' changed here\nGettin' sushi delivered by a reindeer\nMost wonderful time of the year\nIt's a \"Just Eat anything\" vibe over here\nThink outside the box if your plan is\nNothin' more than a cold turkey sandwich (\nCold turkey sandwich, no\n)\nGotta pimp that'll meal like a mac\nLimitless snacks in my Just Eat sack (\nWoo, what?\n)\nYou ever see an elf carryin' a roast ham? (\nUh-huh\n)\nWhen I sit in the whip bumpin' slow jams\nThe weather outside turn cold and\nI stay cooler than a iced up snowman\nWarmin' up with a miso soup\nMe so bossy, and me so Snoop\nGot my man Mister Claus on the line\nLet him know that it's Just Eat time\n[Chorus]\nHappy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas\nLotta treats to complete on the wishlist\nWhatever the venue, hit up the menu\n(\nDid somebody say, Just Eat?\n)\nTell Santa I ain't ask twice\nEverything I order, both naughty and nice\nWhatever the venue, hit up the menu\n(\nDid somebody say, Just Eat?\n)\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, didn't know? Well you know now\nPut your feet up, you ain't gotta go out\nParty, food in the blink of an eye\nMistletoe, kiss this year goodbye (Bye-bye)\nNow it's December, so remember\nYou can get anything you sent for, hmm\nNachos, I'm stackin' chips (\nOh, oh, oh, oh-oh\n)\nSingin' carols with the click and a rack of ribs\nThe gift of givin' is what I'm in for (That's all)\nGot tinsel wrapped around a spring roll\nYep, hit the pad with my pad thai\nBringin' joy to the world, I'm that guy\n[Chorus]\nHappy Holidays, it's a Doggy-Dogg Christmas\nLotta treats to complete on the wishlist\nWhatever the venue, hit up the menu\n(\nDid somebody say, Just Eat?\n)\nTell Santa I ain't ask twice\nEverything I order, both naughty and nice\nWhatever the venue, hit up the menu\n(\nDid somebody say, Just Eat?\n)"
