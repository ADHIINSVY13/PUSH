  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI have a choice between the bat or the belt\nEach time I hear about the hand you've been dealt\nSpare me confession, it's confession you sell\nMaybe I'll fall behind, but I don't mind 'cause I'll catch up!\n[Chorus]\nI want a song that's indelible, like manimal\nI hope you never see me wind up\n[Verse 2]\nWill I be happy on the back of the shelf?\nWill you be happy when we're sharin' a cell?\nSpare me the questions since you know me so well\nSomeday you'll realize that \nI get shy and I choke up!\n[Chorus]\nI want a song that's indelible, like manimal\nI hope you never see me wind up\nWhat's wrong with this animal, I'm terrible\nI hope you never see me wind up\n[Bridge]\nFarewell my sweet \nparamania\nFarewell my sweet \nparamania\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy only promise is that I'll never tell!\nKeep you at a distance from the things that I felt!\nI'll bite the bullet, take the beating until!\nI take it all back anyway, what was I supposed to say?!\n[Chorus]\nI want a song that's indelible, like manimal\nI hope you never see me wind up\nWhat is wrong with this animal, I'm terrible\nI hope you never see me wind up"
