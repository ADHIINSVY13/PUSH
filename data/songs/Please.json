  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe've been crippled in love\nShort changed, hung out to dry\nWe've chalked on the walls\nA slogan or two about life\nStood dazed in the doorway\nThe king and queen of clowns\nWe've been flipped like a coin\nBoth of us landing face-down\n[Chorus]\nSo please, please\nLet me grow old with you\nAfter everything we've been through\nWhat's left to prove\nSo please, please, please, oh please\nLet me grow old with you\n[Verse 2]\nWe've been living with sorrow\nBeen up, down and all around\nWe've buried our feelings\nA little too deep in the ground\nStood dazed in the doorway\nThe king and queen of clowns\nWe've been flipped like a coin\nBoth of us landing face-down\n\n[Chorus]\nSo please, please\nLet me grow old with you\nAfter everything we've been through\nWhat's left to prove\nSo please, please, please, oh please\nLet me grow old with you\n[Bridge]\nBut tied to the same track\nThe two of us look back\nAt oncoming trains ahead\nHow many more times\nCan we lay on the line\nWatching our love hang by a thread\n[Chorus]\nSo please, please\nLet me grow old with you\nAfter everything we've been through\nWhat's left to prove\nSo please, please, please, oh please\nLet me grow old with you\nSo please, please, please, oh please\nLet me grow old with you"
