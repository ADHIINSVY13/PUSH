Oh\n[Bridge]\nI'm the voice inside your head\nYou refuse to hear\nI'm the face that you have to face\nMirrorin' your stare\nI'm what's left, I'm what's right\nI'm the enemy\nI'm the hand that'll take you down\nBring you to your knees\nSo who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\n(Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others?\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?\nYou're the pretender\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\n[Outro]\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)\nYou're the pretender (Pretend)\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nWhat if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)\nWhat if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)\nYou're the pretender (Pretend)\nWhat if I say I will never surrender?\nSo who are you?\nYeah, who are you?\nYeah, who are you?"
