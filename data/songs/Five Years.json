  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPushing through the market square\nSo many mothers sighing (Sighing)\nNews had just come over\nWe had five years left to cry in (Cry in)\nNews guy wept and told us\nEarth was really dying (Dying)\nCried so much his face was wet\nThen I knew he was not lying (Lying)\nI heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies\nI saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs\nMy brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare\nI had to cram so many things to store everything in there\nAnd all the fat, skinny people\nAnd all the tall, short people\nAnd all the nobody people\nAnd all the somebody people\nI never thought I'd need so many people\n[Verse 2]\nA girl my age went off her head\nHit some tiny children\nIf the Black hadn't have pulled her off\nI think she would have killed them\nA soldier with a broken arm\nFixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac\nA cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest\nAnd a queer threw up at the sight of that\nI think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour\nDrinking milkshakes cold and long\nSmiling and waving and looking so fine\nDon't think you knew you were in this song\nAnd it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor\nAnd I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there\nYour face, your race, the way that you talk\nI kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk\n\n[Outro]\nWe've got five years, stuck on my eyes\nFive years, what a surprise\nWe've got five years, my brain hurts a lot\nFive years, that's all we've got\nWe've got five years, what a surprise\nFive years, stuck on my eyes\nWe've got five years, my brain hurts a lot\nFive years, that's all we've got\nWe've got five years, stuck on my eyes\nFive years, what a surprise\nWe've got five years, my brain hurts a lot\nFive years, that's all we've got\nWe've got five years, what a surprise\nWe've got five years, stuck on my eyes\nWe've got five years, my brain hurts a lot\nFive years, that's all we've got\nFive years\nFive years\nFive years\nFive years"
