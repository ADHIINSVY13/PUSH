If you don't, it's cool)\n[Segno: SZA & \nKendrick Lamar\n]\n(\nBut\n) head is the answer, head is the future\nDon't second guess yourself\n(\nDon't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...\n)\nCome on give me some help, hey\nHead is the answer, do it for the future, girl\n[Bridge: Lance Skiiiwalker & \nSZA\n]\nDon't second guess yourself\nCome on, give me some help\nAnd I just wanna\nAnd I just wanna\nStraight up\nEyes with my head\nAnd I can't use some help\nStraight up\n\n[Outro: SZA]\nHead is the future"
