(Hell no)\nAddicted to the things you do\nBut still true what I'm sayin', boo, 'cause this is all about you\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & \n2Pac\n]\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes (\nIt's all about you\n)\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nI make a promise if you go with me\nJust let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave\nNobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga\nI only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers\nI love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place\nWitness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes\nHow can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?\nCreep though, weed smoke's in the air\nEverywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes\nWaitin' for niggas at the end of every show\nI just seen you in my friend's video\nCould never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go\nFollow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through\nIt's all about you\nYeah, nigga, it's all about you\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & \n2Pac\n]\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\n\n[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]\nIs you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?\nIt ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew\nEvery other city we go and every video\nExplain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?\nYou think it's all about you? Well, boo\nI gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too\n[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]\nYou couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track\nA lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff\nWhen I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll\nStraight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll\nHold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next\nGold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex\n[Verse 5: Hussein Fatal]\nI slide in easily, try a grizzly\nSluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me\nRunnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya\nAt the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia\n(It's all about you)\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & \n2Pac\n]\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video (\nIt's all about you\n)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\n\n[Outro: Snoop Dogg]\nI'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit\nI mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?\nI'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video\nI see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video\nThen I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video\nI see the same bitch that was in my video\nYou know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?\nWhat make that even more fucked up\nI'm watchin' a Million Man March\nAnd I see the same bitch on the Million Man March\nThat was in the homeboy Warren G video\nI mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go\nI see the same ho\nDon't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah"
