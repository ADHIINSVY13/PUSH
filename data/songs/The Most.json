  "lyrics": "“The Most” is the demo track that Justin Bieber along with Poo Bear sent to the duo of Skrillex and Diplo to make what is now known as Where Are Ü Now.\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now that I need you?\nWhere are you now that I need you?\nNeed you the most\nWhen you broke down, I didn't leave you\nI stayed by your side\nSo where are you now that I need you?\nNeed you the most\n[Verse 1]\nI gave you attention when nobody else was paying\nI gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?\nTo keep you warm\nI showed you the game everybody else was playing\nThat's for sure\nAnd I was on my knees when nobody else was praying\nOh lord\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now that I need you?\nWhere are you now that I need you?\nNeed you the most\nWhen you broke down, I didn't leave you\nI stayed by your side\nSo where are you now that I need you?\nNeed you the most\n\n[Verse 2]\nI gave you my heart when you said yours was broken\nYes I did\nI gave you the key when the door wasn't open\nJust admit it\nSee I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping\nCan't deny it\nNow I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping\nTell me...\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you now that I need you?\nWhere are you now?\nWhere are you now that I need you?\nCouldn't find you anywhere\nWhen you broke down, I didn't leave you\nI was by your side\nSo where are you now that I need you?\nI need you the most"
