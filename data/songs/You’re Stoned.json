  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nMmm\nMmm\n[Verse 1]\nLay on me the weight of the world\nSmiling like you're given a gift\nDon't you wanna dance with your little girl?\nIn the shadows, I can see those things you hid\nFrom me\n[Chorus]\nYou burn all your dirty laundry\nYou curse at your phone\nYou set the house on fire and tell me to come home\nTell me you're stoned\nMmm\nMmm\n[Verse 2]\nTwist my words and then wring 'em out\nDrag me down into your jealousy\nRising to inside your open mouth\nTaking out your whole life on me\nOn me\n\n[Chorus]\nYou burn all your dirty laundry\nYou curse at your phone\nYou set the house on fire and tell me to come home\nTell me you're stoned\n[Bridge]\nDon't tell me to come home, you must be stoned\nWon't be wrapped up in your wings that spread with disaster\nNo, I'm not all those things you might be after\nMaybe you're just too stoned to see you're the reason I don't come home\nToo faded to see that my heart's growin' blacker\n[Chorus]\nYou burn all your dirty laundry\nYou curse at your phone\nYou set the house on fire and tell me to come home\nTell me you're stoned"
