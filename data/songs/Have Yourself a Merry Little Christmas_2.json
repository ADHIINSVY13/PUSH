  "lyrics": "Have yourself a merry little Christmas\nLet your heart be light\nFrom now on\nOur troubles will be out of sight\nHave yourself a merry little Christmas\nMake the Yule-tide gay\nFrom now on\nOur troubles will be miles away\nHere we are as in olden days\nHappy golden days of yore\nFaithful friends who are dear to us\nGather near to us once more\nThrough the years\nWe all will be together\nIf the Fates allow\nHang a shining star upon the highest bough\nAnd have yourself a merry little Christmas now"
