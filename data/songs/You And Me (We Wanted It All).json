  "lyrics": "You and me, we wanted it all\nWe wanted it all\nPassion without pain, sunshine without rainy days\nWe wanted it always\nYou and me, we reached for the sky\nThe limit was high\nNever giving in, certain we could win that prize\nI should have seen it in your eyes\nLook how all our dreams came true\nSee how I've got me and, baby, you've got you\nThrough it all, just one thing died\nA little thing called love, something deep inside\nYou and me, we're not like the rest\nWe once were the best\nBack when we were dumb, how did we become so smart\nAnd learn to break each other's heart?\nLook how all our dreams came true\nSee how I've got me, baby, you've got you\nThrough it all, just one thing died\nA little thing called love, something deep inside\nYou and me, we're not like the rest\nWe once were the best\nBut look what we became, isn't it a cryin' shame\nThat we almost made it?\n\nBut we wanted it all\nBaby, you and me\nWe wanted it all\nMmm, mmm-mmm, mmm"
