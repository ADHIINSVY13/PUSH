Did you write your name?\nOn the dirty ceilin', I can't explain\n[Chorus]\nI need medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure\nMedicine at midnight callin', but it ain't no cure\nI may be sick, but you know\nI'm yours\n[Verse 2]\nI remember dancin' hard under the dead moon\nHowlin' with you, howlin'!\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEver get the feelin' nothin' else will do?\nI could hear you singin', I can't explain\n\n[Chorus]\nI need medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure\nMedicine at midnight, howlin', but it ain't no cure\nI may be sick, but you know\nI'm yours\n[Bridge]\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes\n[Chorus]\nMedicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure\nMedicine at midnight, howlin', but it ain't no cure\nI may be sick, but you know\nI'm yours\n[Outro]\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes\nRain on the dance floor, back against the ropes"
