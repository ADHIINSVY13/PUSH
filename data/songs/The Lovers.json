  "lyrics": "Up from the pastures of boredom\nOut from the sea of discontent\nThey come in packs like hungry hounds\nUp seekers of the dark enchantment\nThey haunt the boulevards and bars\nThey pray to wishing wells and stars\nThey ride the hurricane of hope\nNot looking back, but on they go\nToward the distance and deceiving\nAnd all the while they keep believing\nThey are special and apart\nThe lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers\nAnd when they pair off two by two\nThey feel they are the chosen few\nAnd though their beds are made of straw\nThey feel like velvet in the night\nAnd so the night is never ending\nIts made of distance and pretending\nCoz they're special and apart\nThe lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers\nAnd when love goes away\nAnd when love goes...\nGoodbye...\nCatches in their throats like cotton\nRises in their hearts like rain\nThe good times suddenly are all forgotten\nThe hunt begins again\n\nThey search the subways and the streets\nTheir faces tired, like their feet\nTheir bodies aching to be warm\nAnd so they hide behind the moon\nTheir loneliness inside them growing\nBut they take comfort in just knowing\nThat they are special and apart\nThe lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers\nAnd when love comes again\nAnd when love comes\nHello...\nRises from their throats like singing\nCatches in their hearts like wind\nThe good things\nStrangers in their arms are bringing\nMakes life all right again\nThey turn their faces to the light\nNo longer hiding in the night\nSo unashamed and unafraid\nThat they can face each others faults\nAnd though the waltz will have its ending\nThere is no harm in just pretending\nThat they are special and apart\nThe lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers"
