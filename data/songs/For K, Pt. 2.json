It's just a stupid bar\nI didn't promise anythin', no, mmm-mmm\nYou think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk\nI like your music and you like the way I walk, so\nI think we're gonna get along, mmm-hmm\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder\nThe way your hair come down, it make you look older\nHow you get so handsome, my boy?\nOh, mmm\n[Chorus]\nPretty baby\nPretty baby\nHow?\n[Verse 2]\nThe way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know\nThe way you stand up and your silhouette glows\nI'm electrified, I'll be up all night now\nYeah-yeah, yeah\nUse that voice, sing that song\nAnd tell me to come on, to come on, come on\nYou won't hear no\n, \nyou won't hear no\nMmm-mmm\n\n[Chorus]\nPretty baby\nPretty baby\nHow?\nPretty baby"
