  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wanna be drunk when I wake up\nOn the right side of the wrong bed\nAnd never an excuse I made up\nTell you the truth I hate\nWhat didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all\nLove will scar your makeup lipsticks to me\nSo now, I'll maybe lean back there\nI'm sat here, wishin' I was sober\nI know I'll never hold you like I used to\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut our house gets cold when you cut the heating\nWithout you to hold, I'll be freezin'\nCan't rely on my heart to beat it\n'Cause you take part of it every evenin'\nTake words out of my mouth just from breathin'\nReplace with phrases like, \"When ya leavin' me?\"\nShould I? Should I?\n[Chorus]\nMaybe I'll get drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wanna hold your heart in both hands\nNot watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can\nAnd I got no plans for the weekend\nSo should we speak then? Keep it between friends?\nThough I know you'll never love me like you used to\nThere may be other people like us\nWe'll see the flicker of the clipper when they light up\nFlames just create us, burns don't heal like before\nYou don't hold me anymore\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOn cold days, cold plays out like the band's name\nI know I can't heal things with a handshake\nYou know I can't change, as I began saying\nYou cut me wide open like a landscape\nOpen bottles of beer, but never champagne\nTo applaud you with the sound that my hands make\nShould I? Should I?\n[Chorus]\nMaybe I'll get drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love\n\n[Bridge]\nAll by myself\nI'm here again\nAll by myself\nYou know I'll never change\nAll by myself\nAll by myself\n[Chorus]\nI'm just drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nI'll be drunk again\nTo feel a little love"
