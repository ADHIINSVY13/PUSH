  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMake sure nobody sees you leave\nHood over your head, keep your eyes down\nTell your friends you're out for a run\nYou’ll be flushed when you return\nTake the road less traveled by\nTell yourself you can always stop\nWhat started in beautiful rooms\nEnds with meetings in parking lots\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's the thing about illicit affairs\nAnd clandestine meetings and longing stares\nIt's born from just one single glance\nBut it dies and it dies and it dies\nA million little times\n[Verse 2]\nLeave the perfume on the shelf\nThat you picked out just for him\nSo you leave no trace behind\nLike you don’t even exist\nTake the words for what they are\nA dwindling, mercurial high\nA drug that only worked\nThe first few hundred times\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's the thing about illicit affairs\nAnd clandestine meetings and stolen stares\nThey show their truth one single time\nBut they lie and they lie and they lie\nA million little times\n[Bridge]\nAnd you wanna scream\nDon't call me \"kid,\" don't call me \"baby\"\nLook at this godforsaken mess that you made me\nYou showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else\nDon't call me \"kid,\" don't call me \"baby\"\nLook at this idiotic fool that you made me\nYou taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else\n[Outro]\nAnd you know damn well\nFor you, I would ruin myself\nA million little times"
