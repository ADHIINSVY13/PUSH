That's not a fact about Argentina\nShh, play it cool, I actually don't know anything about Argentina\n[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo & \nMadison Hu\n]\nArgentina is the eighth-largest country in the world\nArgentina is home to boys and lots of girls\nBuenos Aires is the capitol, the city's alive\nWhen you jump in Argentina, rules of gravity apply\n[Interlude: Olivia Rodrigo & \nMadison Hu\n]\nGravity? You don't know one single thing about Argentina?\nUh, they have beef there?\nYеs, \nArgentina is the third-largest еxporter of beef in the world\nOh, in that case\n[Verse 3: Madison Hu, \nOlivia Rodrigo\n & \nBoth\n]\nDown south, I know a place where we can have some fun\nWhere the farmers raise beef \nand they do it well done\nIt's like a kingdom of cows, \nI'm super impressed\nWhen it comes to herding cattle, \nArgentina does it best\n(\nYou just got T-boned, son\n)\nI ride high in the saddle every time I rap battle\nGot my mind on my money \nand my money's on the cattle\nI be chillin' and grillin', \nfillin' up on mad steaks\nThen I retreat to the beef, \neven when my belly aches\n(\nYou want fries with that?\n)\n\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]\nBeef, beef, y'all, Argentina's got beef\nMeet me at the border where the steak is cooked to order\nBeef, beef, y'all, Argentina's got beef\nIt's the place I wanna stay when I'm cravin' filet\n[Outro: Madison Hu]\nAh, yeah, stay milky, y'all"
