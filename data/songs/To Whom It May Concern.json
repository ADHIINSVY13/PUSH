He's failing my class\nHe's always late for class, he's always asleep, he's never paying attention..\nAnd when he's up, you know, he's running around the class just disturbing everyone..\nI had to kick him out of class yesterday, because some girl had her hands in his pants doing god knows what in the back of my class\n[Verse 1]\nI can't wait for the day, to tell my momma we made it\nThe whole family waiting, they talking, always debating\nWhether I'm doing good,\n I'm feeling misunderstood\nI know I dropped out of school, your friends think I am a fool\nI know what that means to you, I know what you're going through\nI'm always here for you, I hope you know that it's true\nThis one's for you, rapping what I love to do\nI know I got your support, so we'll gon' make it through\nDie for ya, you know I'd die for ya\nImma make this money, Imma get you something\nGonna prove everybody, that I don't live for nothing\nYou raised me, and you gave me, everything you could, so I thank you\nYou raised me, and you gave me, everything you could, so I thank you\nYou raised me, and you gave me, everything you could, so I thank you\nI gotta do (I gotta do), What I gotta do (What I gotta do)\nI wanna hear you say (I wanna hear you say), I ain't mad at you (I ain't mad at you).
