  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nEvil, why have you engulfed so many hearts? Evil\nEvil, why have you destroyed so many minds?\nLeaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide\nEvil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred?\nEvil, why have you stolen so much love?\nLeaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free, yeah, yeah\nEvil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes? Evil\nEvil, before they could really grow to see\nThat your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be\nEvil, why have you destroyed, you've destroyed so much of this doggone world?\nEvil, hey, evil, oh, why have you broken so many homes?\nLeaving sweet love all alone, an outcast of the world"
