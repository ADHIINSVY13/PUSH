  "lyrics": "Day in, day out\nThe same old voodoo follows me about\nThe same old pounding in my heart\nWhenever I think of you\nAnd darling, I think of you\nDay in and day out\nDay out, day in\nI needn't tell you how my days begin\nWhen I awake, I awaken with a tingle\nOne possibility in view\nThat possibility of maybe seein' you\nCome rain, come shine\nI meet you and to me, the day is fine\nThen I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes\nThe oceans roar, a thousand drums\nCan't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt\nWhen there it is, day in, day out?\nCome rain, come on shine\nI meet you and to me, the day is fine\nThen I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes\nA large ocean's roar, nine thousand drums\nCan't you see that it's love? Can there be any doubt?\nWhen there it is\nAnd here it is\nWhen there it is, day in, day out?"
