What you doin'?\" — \"Kickin' it.\"\nI shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense\nWith the homies\n(Police sirens)\nBut – they made a right, then made a left\nThen made a right, then another right\nOne lucky night with the homies\n[Outro]\nK. Dot, you faded, hood?\nYeah, we finally got that nigga faded\nI think he hit the wrong blunt though\nOoh, which one?\nWell, which one he talkin' about?\nI was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it\nI pray he ain't hit that\nNah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one\nGot the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!\nNigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe\nNigga, for what?\nWhat that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?\n\"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!\"\nYeah, yeah, that shit right there\nI'm tryna be the nigga in the street\nThere he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go\nLook, here's the plan, luv\nWe gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out,\n complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park\n'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight\nThat's what he's not gon' do\nThen we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30\nThat's straight, but we should meet up around 12\nI'm tryna fuck on somethin' too\nNigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!\nNigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!\nMatter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!\nWe finna get active!\n[Produced by Tabu]"
