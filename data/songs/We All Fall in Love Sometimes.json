  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWise men say\n\"It looks like rain today\nIt crackled on the speakers\nAnd trickled down the sleepy subway trains\nFor heavy eyes could hardly hold us\nAching legs that often told us it's all worth it\nWe all fall in love sometimes\"\n[Verse 2]\nThe full moon's bright\nAnd starlight filled the evening\nWe wrote it and I played it\nSomethin' happened\nIt's so strange this feelin'\nNa√Øve notions that were childish\nSimple tunes that tried to hide it\nBut when it comes\nWe all fall in love sometimes\n[Chorus]\nDid we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we?\nI'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind\nStrugglin' through the day\nWhen even your best friend says\n\"Don't you find\nWe all fall in love sometimes?\"\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Bridge]\nAnd only passin' time\nCould kill the boredom we acquired\nRunnin' with the losers for a while\nBut our \nEmpty Sky\n was filled with laughter\nJust before the flood\nPainting worried faces with a smile\n[Verse 1]\nWise men say\n\"It looks like rain today\nIt crackled on the speakers\nAnd trickled down the sleepy subway trains\nFor heavy eyes could hardly hold us\nAching legs that often told us\nIt's all worth it\nWe all fall in love sometimes\"\n[Outro]\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!\nWe all fall in love sometimes"
