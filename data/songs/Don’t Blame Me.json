  "lyrics": "Don't, don't blame me for falling in love with you\nI'm under your spell, how can I help it?\nDon't blame me\nCan't you see when you do the things you do?\nIf I can't conceal the thrill that I feel\nDon't blame me\nI can't help it if that doggoned moon up above\nMakes, makes me need something like you to love\nBlame your kiss, strange as a kiss could be\nAnd blame all your charms that melt in my arms\nBut don't blame me"
