(Age now)\nAm I already on the way out? (Way out)\nWhen I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage (When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage)\nI'm a dog in a dog pound\nAnd you said I was your secret (Ah)\nAnd you didn't get to keep it\nAnd the internet is hungry for the meanest kinda funny\nAnd somebody's gotta feed it (Ah)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, do you still cry? (Still cry, oh, do you?)\nStill cry (Do you? Ooh)\nCry\n[Bridge]\nI never did you wrong (Never did you wrong)\nAnd my (Ah), my patience is gone (Is gone)\nAnd I (I), I never did you wrong (You wrong)\nI, I loved you for so long, hmm\n[Outro]\nAh (Mm)\nAh-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah\nAh, ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah (Ah)"
