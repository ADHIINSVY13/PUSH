  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nOh, yeah\nOne, two, three, four\n[Verse 1]\nI never fell in love so easily\nWhere the four winds blow, I carry on\nI'd like to take you where my spirit flies\nThrough the empty skies, we go alone\nNever before having flown\n[Verse 2]\nFaster than lightning is this heart of mine\nIn the face of time, I carry on\nI'd like to take you where my rainbow ends\nBe my lover, friend, we'll go alone\nNever before having flown\n[Chorus]\nI am your hurricane, your fire in the sun\nHow long must I live in the air?\nYou are my paradise, my angel on the run\nHow long must I wait?\nIt's the dawn of the feeling that starts from the moment you're there\n[Verse 3]\nYou'll never know what you have done for me\nYou've broken all those rules I live upon\nAnd I'd like to take you to my Shangri-La\nNeither here or far away from home\nNever before having flown\n\n[Chorus]\nI am your hurricane, your fire in the sun\nHow long must I live in the air?\nYou are my paradise, my angel on the run\nHow long must I wait?\nIt's the dawn of the feeling that starts from the moment you're there\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'd like to take you where my spirit flies\nThrough the empty skies, we go alone\nNever before having flown"
