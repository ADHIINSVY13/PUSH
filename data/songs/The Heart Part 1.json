Cole runnin' late\nIf he don't show up, think I can take his place\nLadies start laughing\nNo pun intended I ain't being sarcastic\nHomie popped up with about twenty bags and\nFresh out the plane I couldn't even complain\nMy nigga was on his hustle I introduced him my name\nSaid I'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude I salute ya\nContributing the real shit\nTalk about it make the people talk about it\nMake the world see, for every MC that I see tryna stay afloat\nTell 'em build a boat like Noah\nAnd take him to a place that I'm sure we all can blow up, boom\nI ain't a star yet but I'm gettin' close to 'em\nAnd if you see a whack artist do more than boo him\nThrow him off the banister, shoot him on camera\nThen kill his manager\nThen hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed\nWithout bein' conceived by one album of the 90's\nOn Rosecrans where you'll find me\nAnd all my niggas is grimy\nBut I remain the good kid\nTryna make a difference where I'm from, where you live\nOh no we got to slow the city down\nI told the homeboy pump his brakes\nHe said that he rather put the pump to his face\nSawed off\nTorture, turn the saw off, its scorchin'\nHot where I'm from, the newscasters don't come\nAnother ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan I ain't done\nA baby in there with it\nShe said postpartum did it\nMolested at eleven and she always reminiscing\nWhen he was undressing said it'll only be a minute\nThat's why I I think i'm always kicking something with feeling\nI should've been a dentist\nI should've been a blizzard-cold\nFlash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes\nI wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes\nTryna kill my dreams\nNot elevate\nThose are not my dreams, I'll be straight\nWith a little bit of passion\nAnd a drive like an Aston\nMotivation from Nipsey or Glasses, Jay Rock\nMykestro , Bad Lucc, U-N-I\nDom Kennedy, Murs and Fashawn\nLady G, Willy B in time\nI'ma blow like I'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines\nGo like I never seen a red light shine\nFlow to my heart, hit the flo' when I'm dying\nHeart of a lion, tell 'em get in line\nAnd pass the baton, I won't pass it back I ain't good at dimes\nIf the bitch bad I could pass you a dime\nHaters better duck like I'm passing a pond\nKnow I'm the king and I'm passing you pawns\nPad on the hill that's a passion of mine\nProblem is I shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights\nI'ma need two mics just to get my point across\nI'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me\nP—\n\n[Outro: Sample]\n\"This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts—\""
