  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStop the music right now 'cause it don't feel right\nI've been trying to get close to you all night\nFollow my lead, I promise it'll be alright\nCan you hear it coming? Can you hear that sound?\n[Chorus]\nJust slow down\nHold my hair back and make me proud\nBanging on my chest, you're the best and you know that\nBaby can we slow down? Slow down\n[Verse 2]\nStop the music and pour me all over you\nOh baby, you're the rhythm and I am the beat you choose\nI close my eyes so I feel everything you do\nCan you feel it coming? Can you hear the sound?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMeet me on the left side\nAnd drown me in the right light\nI choose you out of all these guys\nThis is your night\nThis white wine\nIs blurring up my eyesight\nKeep telling you I'm all right\nI'm all right\n\n[Chorus]\nBut slow down\nHold my hair back and make me proud\nBanging on my chest, you're the best and you know now (Yeah, yeah)\nBaby can we slow down? Slow down\n[Outro]\nSlow\nSlow\nSlow"
