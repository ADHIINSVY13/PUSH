know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me\n (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nAyo, it's packed on this Rikers bus\nThe tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled\nThe life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso\nOn the streets I was invincible\nCowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew\nWhat my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer\nMother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me\nAll in front of my friends in the street, smile with no teeth\nI never knew daddy, heard he had a '72 caddy\nDied in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably three\nWhy didn't my folks just die in this society\nWhy wasn't I a child of a doctor who left stocks for me?\nTwo little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat\nMother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me\nI'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father\nWhether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers\nBlurry visions of dad holdin' me high\nIt comes to me slowly, the words he would cry\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\n[Verse 2: Millennium Thug]\nIt is I that step up, me that don't give a fuck\nYou that foe, then it's all over soldier\nHummers and Ranges through the desert, fuck a twenty-inch\nLong as we got gas and we got water\nTroopers lookin' for manslaughter, I gotta get back\nFor what they owe, shoot 'em in the back for the get back\nLead through shit bag, hogtie, gag\nForget the life had, now we all rebels\nEverything burnt down includin' the ghetto\nWe can see for miles, the land, it's major rubble\nAnd debris from the Earth as we knew crumble\nYo, you could see the sea and the stars look closer to me\nI'm a mad man, this is a real life movie, Mad Max\nSKs, AKs max\nABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap\nMy mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but, yo\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\n[Verse 3: Nas & \nMillennium Thug\n]\nYo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls\nI got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God\nBrothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape\nSome brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape\nHow is the war, and, yo, I'm wishin' I was in your shoes\nHoldin' machine guns, clean fun\nShootin' dudes with fatigues on\nAnywhere is better than this\nIt's America's plan, every color of man inherits the shit\nYo, I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares\nI know the warden is readin' the scribe, \nbut, yo, I swear\nIt's a billion dollar business\n, \ncourts, lawyers and jails\nWe all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel\n[\nVerse 4: Millennium Thug\n]\nThere's not a bitch in sight or a block bench\nAll-black gate, all-gray fence\nLook who fucked it all up, Mr. President\nI remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent\nNow it's state of the art\nI just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart\nWhat a bloody mess, a slug fest\nI just buried eight of mine\nAt night I hear grown men cryin'\nYou know I'm spittin' mine, I ain't goin' out here\nWe gotta win, every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in\nI'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head\nCatchin' my breath, watchin' my back\nSmokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass\nI don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake\nEvery day I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape\nAnd if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (My country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (Nah, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen ('Cause the things we seen)\n[Outro: Nas]\nThis goes out to Che Guevara\nA revolutionary destroyed by his country\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nThis goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz\nJust tryna to fight for what's real\nThis goes out to Martin\nAll about peace and destroyed by his own country\nThis goes out to everybody in the whole world\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nTo Patrice Lumumba\nJust trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people\nThis goes out to my hood niggas\nComing up every day just trying to survive\nThe only way we know how\nBut see we know too much now, and we seen too much now\nSo ain't nothing gon' to stop us now\nTo my country\nMy country\nMy country\nMy country\nMy country\nYeah, my country"
