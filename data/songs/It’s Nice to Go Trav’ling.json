  "lyrics": "It's very nice to go trav'ling\nTo Paris London and Rome\nIt's oh so nice to go trav'ling\nBut it's so much nicer, yes it's so much nicer to come home\nIt's very nice to just wander\nThe camel route to Iraq\nIt's oh so nice to just wander\nBut it's so much nicer, yes it's oh so nice to wander back\nThe mam'selles and frauleins and the señoritas are sweet\nBut they can't compete 'cause they just don't have\nWhat the models have on Madison Ave\nIt's very nice to be footloose\nWith just a toothbrush and comb\nIt's oh so nice to be footloose\nBut your heart starts singin' when your homeward wingin' across the foam\nAnd you know your fate is\nWhere the Empire State is\nAll you contemplate is\nThe view from Miss Liberty's dome\nIt's very nice to go trav'ling\nBut it's oh so nice to come home\n\nYou will find the maiden and the gay muchachas are rare\nBut they can't compare with that sexy line\nThat parades each day at Sunset and Vine\nIt's quite the life to play gypsy\nAnd roam as gypsies will roam\nIt's quite the life to play gypsy\nBut your heart starts singin' when your homeward wingin' 'cross the foam\nAnd the Hudson River\nMakes you start to quiver\nLike the latest flivver\nThat's simply drippin' with chrome\nIt's very nice to go trav'ling\nBut it's oh so nice to come home\nNo more customs\nBurn the passport\nNo more packin'\nAnd unpackin'\nLight the home fires\nGet my slippers\nMake a pizza"
