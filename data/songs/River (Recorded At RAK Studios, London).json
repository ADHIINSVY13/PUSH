  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's coming on Christmas\nThey're cutting down trees\nThey're putting up reindeer\nAnd singing songs of joy and peace\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on\nBut it don't snow here, it stays pretty green\nI'm going to make a lot of money\nThen I'm going to quit this crazy scene\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on\n[Chorus]\nI wish I had a river so long\nI would teach my feet to fly\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on\nI made my baby cry\n[Verse 2]\nHe tried hard to help me\nYou know, he put me at ease\nAnd he loved me so naughty\nMade me weak in the knees\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on\nI'm so hard to handle\nI'm selfish and I'm sad\nNow I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I had a river so long\nI would teach my feet to fly\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on\nI made my baby say goodbye\n[Outro]\nIt's coming on Christmas\nThey're cutting down trees\nThey're putting up reindeer\nAnd singing songs of joy and peace\nOh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on"
