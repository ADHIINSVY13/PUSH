  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLook into my eyes he tells her\nI'm gonna say goodbye he says, yeah\nDo not cry she begs of him goodbye, yeah\nAll that day she thinks of his love, yeah\nThey whip him through the streets and alleys there\nThe gormless and the baying crowd right there\nThey can't get enough of that doomsday song\nThey can't get enough of it all\nListen\n[Verse 2]\nListen to the whores he tells her\nHe fashions paper sculptures of them\nThen drags them to the river's bank in the cart\nTheir soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark\nAnd the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin\nOf his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest\n[Chorus]\nHere I am, not quite dying\nMy body left to rot in a hollow tree\nIts branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me\nAnd the next day, and the next, and another day\n[Verse 3]\nIgnoring the pain of their particular diseases\nThey chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps\nThey haul him through the mud and they chant for his death\nAnd drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest\nFirst they give you everything that you want\nThen they take back everything that you have\nThey live upon their feet and they die upon their knees\nThey can work with Satan while they dress like the saints\nThey know God exists for the Devil told them so\nThey scream my name aloud down into the well below\n\n[Chorus]\nHere I am, not quite dying\nMy body left to rot in a hollow tree\nIts branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me\nAnd the next day, and the next, and another day\nHere I am, not quite dying\nMy body left to rot in a hollow tree\nIts branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me\nAnd the next day, and the next, and another day\nHere I am, not quite dying\nMy body left to rot in a hollow tree\nIts branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me\nAnd the next day, and the next, and another day\n[Outro]\nListen"
