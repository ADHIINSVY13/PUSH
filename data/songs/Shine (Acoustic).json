  "lyrics": "Who cares for the life we've earned?\nSomeone sold all the truth you yearned\nRemember when you used to shine\nAnd had no fear or sense of time\nWhen it creeps up on you\nYou can't cry now, there's nothing to feel\nNo one has noticed our loneliness\nRemember when you used to tease\nAnd made us scream eternal joy\nI believed that you'd always be here\nCause once you promised a life with no fear\nPlease don't break my ideals\nAnd say what's fake was always real\nI was the one\nAnd now I'm gone\nTake me back again"
