  "lyrics": "One of three B-Sides to Cave, the others being Twin and Host.  It is one of Muse’s oldest songs, dating back to 1996.  It is also quite poppy, but it’s very catchy.\n[Verse 1]\nConfide in me\nSustain all my apathy\nYou're such a mess\nYou can learn not to confess\n[Chorus 1]\nYou will not find it in me\nSimply because I can't\nWake up and find it in me\nI'm in a coma\nYou will not find it in me\nAnd you'll reveal all your pains again\n[Verse 2]\nWe'll fall asleep\nSo deeply out of reach\nFor years feeling dead\nWe can fall right out of bed\n[Chorus 1]\nYou will not find it in me\nSimply because I can't\nWake up and find it in me\nI'm in a coma\nYou will not find it in me\nAnd you'll reveal all your pains again\n\n[Chorus 2]\nHey\n, such a mess and I don't care\nSimply because I can't\nWake up and find it in me\nI'm in a coma\nYou will not find it in me\nAnd you'll reveal all your pains again"
