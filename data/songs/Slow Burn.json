  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHere shall we live in this terrible town\nWhere the price for our minds shall squeeze them tight like a fist\nAnd the walls shall have eyes\n and the doors shall have ears\nBut we'll dance in the dark and they'll play with our lives\n[Chorus]\nLike a slow burn, leading us on and on and on\nLike a slow burn, turning us 'round and 'round and 'round\nHark who are we, so small in times such as these?\nSlow burn, slow burn\n[Verse 2]\nOh, these are the days, these are the strangest of all\nThese are the nights, these are the darkest to fall\nBut who knows, echoes in tenement halls?\nWho knows, though the years snare them all?\n[Chorus]\nLike a slow burn, leading us on and on and on\nLike a slow burn, turning us 'round and 'round and upside down\nThere's fear overhead, there's fear overground\nSlow burn, slow burn\n[Chorus]\nLike a slow burn, leading us on and on and on\nLike a slow burn, turning us 'round and 'round and 'round\nAnd here are we, at the center of it all\nSlow burn, slow burn, slow burn"
