(Biggie!)\nNiggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)\nIt ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose\nNigga you scared you're supposed to\nNigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart\nFuck up the party before it even start\nPissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk\nOn some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks\n[Chorus: Faith Evans]\nLadies from front to back\nSipping on Champagne glass\nIt's all where the party's at\n(It's where the party's at)\nLadies creeping their ride\nPimping and getting high\nTo be where the party's at\n\n[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nBitches in the back looking righteous\nIn a tight dress, I think I might just\nHit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun\nAnd have fun with Jamaican rum\nConversation, blunts in rotation\nMy man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and\nWe're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking\nIf money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm\nShe grabbed my arm and said \"Let's leave calm\"\nI'm hitting skins again\nRolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken\nNiggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out\nBlows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out\nCan't we just all get along?\nSo I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn\nGet her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon\nAnd it's on, and I'm gone, that's that\n[Chorus: Faith Evans]\nLadies from front to back\nSipping on Champagne glass\nIt's all where the party's at\n(It's where the party's at)\nLadies creeping their ride\nPimping and getting high\nTo be where the party's at"
