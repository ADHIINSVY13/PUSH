  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDo it with the lips that you kept when I finally kissed you\nWhen every single light in the Hills and the Valley went blue\nMake love as soft as cinnamon\nKnow when to take and when to give\nRunning out of bed in your leopard print to unlock the door\n[Chorus]\nSleeping on your fingertips\n, dreaming with a filthy heart\nDeep within a threesome-kiss, \nsweet how the words slip\nHonest with the love you give, careless with the way you talk\nSay you want it just like this, sweet how the words slip\n[Verse 2]\nDo it with the lips that you kept when I said I was yours\nWith X's on the prints\n, they're of \nMarilyn by Bеrt Stern\nLit candles, pink and yellow cakе\nLet's get fucked up and celebrate\nRolling out of bed in your tangled hair to put some clothes on\n[Chorus]\nSleeping on your fingertips, dreaming with a filthy heart\nDeep within a threesome-kiss, sweet how the words slip\nHonest with the love you give, careless with the way you talk\nSay you want it just like this, sweet how the words slip\n\n[Outro]\nSweet how the words slip\nSweet how the words slip"
