Got out the 600\n, \nblunted\n, \nchicks hunt him\nNeighborhood know he comin'\nJake hate him\n, \nsnakes could not violate him\nPimps memorize his lines verbatim\nHe reps N.Y., yo\n, \ngives C-notes to winos\nNot church, it's how he tithe though\nHe walks the tenement, sleeps at his super fly condo\nMy kinda nigga\n, \nmy Icon, my idol\nNo certificate for this misfit who handle business\nThe odds stacked against him, he fights back mackin' Benzes\nNever puts cash or ass before friendship\nHe laughs last\n, \nas some die young, he is still existin'\nSomehow he got around the pitfalls of the system\nWhen he walks, we watch, when he talks, we listen. \nLeaders\n\n[Chorus: Stephen Marley]\nThis one's for all the leaders\nLeader\nLet's all change the world\nChange the world\n[Chorus: Stephen Marley]\nThis one's for all the leaders\nLeader\nLet's all change the world\nChange the world\n[Verse 2: Damian Marley]\nWho do I follow? (Follow) Who do I copy? (Copy)\nLook into the mirror, and it's you I see look at me\nEverything new, like it fresh from the factory\nEverything you do? It impact me\nYour lifestyle attract me\n, \nparents try distract me\nWhen I grow up, I want to be like you exactly (exactly, exactly)\nAnd as soon as I get over this acne\nThere's no way anybody coulda stop me\nMe gravitate toward the aura and all the mannerism\nThe sendin' out of orders and man start movin' busy\nThe lockin' of the corners? The streets and all the buildings\nMi love you like a father, mi ready and mi willin'\nAnything what you a talk is law in my dominion\nAnd mi have similar thoughts, I share the same opinions\nMi have it say you smart with mi best interest at heart\nI'm followin' your path, yow mine when you a walk\n\n[Chorus: Stephen Marley]\nThis one's for all the leaders\nLeader\nLet's all change the world\nChange the world\n[Chorus: Stephen Marley]\nThis one's for all the leaders\nLeader\nLet's all change the world\nChange the world\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nThey appeal to the conscious\nThe Paramount, the Caesar, the monsters\nThe grandiose, the martyrs, the hell on Earth pompous\n, \nEllsworth Bumpy Johnsons\nThe Harlemites, the Garveyites, black as the credit card we swipe\n, \npoppin' Dom tonight\nFor all of mine, \nI can see myself back at the Audubon\nMalcolm on the podium, shells drop to linoleum\nSwipe those, place 'em on display at the Smithsonian\nNext to only gems that were left behind by holy men\nInfectious charisma of those who gave us direction\nThe anti-sexists, resistance against oppression\nProgressive thinkin', ghetto speakers\nProtestors against the colored\n, \nonly section to the Jena 6 and\nThe Frost-Nixon, the contradiction; the cross, the crucifixion\nThe loss we took for sinnin' on Esau's back inscription\nThat \nit was written\n, that nothing is coincidencing\nThey took our leaders and they lynched them\n\n[Chorus: Stephen Marley]\nThis one's for all the leaders\nLeader\nLet's all change the world\nChange the world\n[Chorus: Stephen Marley]\nThis one's for all the leaders\nLeader\nLet's all change the world\nChange the world\n[Outro: Stephen Marley]\nChange the world, change the world\nChange the world\nChange the world, change the world\nYou change the world"
