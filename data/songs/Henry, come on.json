That's the thing\nYou can't chase a ghost when it's gone\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's not \nbecause of you\nThat I turned out so dangerous\nYesterday, I heard God say, \"It's in your blood\"\nAnd it struck me just like lightning\nI've been fighting, I've been striving\nBut yesterday, I heard God say, \"You were born to be the one\nTo hold the hand of the man\nWho flies too close to the sun\"\n\n[Bridge]\nAll these country singers\nAnd their lonely rides to Houston\nDoesn't really make for the best\nYou know, settle-down type\n[Outro]\nIt's last call, \"Hey, y'all\"\nHang his hat up on the wall\nTell him that his cowgirl is gone\nGo on and giddy up\nLast call, \"Hey, y'all\"\nHang his hat up on the wall\nTell him that his cowgirl is gone\nGo on and giddy up\nGo on and giddy up\nGo on and giddy up\nHey"
