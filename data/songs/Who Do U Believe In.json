Reflections in the mirror\nWe can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac]\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nCan't close my eyes, ‘cause all I see is terror\nI hate the man in the mirror\n‘Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer\nTimes of Armageddon, murder in mass amounts\nIn this society where only gettin' the cash counts\nI started out as a beginner\n, \nentered the criminal lifestyle, became a sinner\nI make my money, and vacate, evade prison\nWent from the chosen one to an outcast, unforgivin'\nAnd all the Hennessy and weed can't hide the pain I feel inside\nYou know,\nit's like I'm livin' just to die\nI fall on my knees and beg for mercy\nNot knowin' if I'm worthy, livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me\nSo I'm askin', before I lay me down to sleep\nBefore you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me; my misery\nI rose up from the slums, made it out the flames\nIn my search for fame, will I change?\nI'm askin'…\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac]\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\n[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]\nFaith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic\n‘Cause so far I done witnessed too many dead niggas in caskets\nWith they chest plates stretched, like elastic\nAnd what's worse I'm on front line\nHoldin' down camp, still mashin'\nHeard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block\nJust came home October of '95, back in Yardsville stuck\nWith a three to five, if he don't act up\nNow he realize, if you don't stay wise\nThen in this game you fucked\nTalk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard\nOne of the grimies is snitchin', dimin', a stool pigeon\nI talked to him; he said he didn't, my man said he did\nIn fact he's sure, ‘cause he just came home off of bid\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac]\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\n[Overlapped Chorus: 2Pac]\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin', who do you believe in?\n[Collision]\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?\nIs it Jesus? Is it God? Or is it just yourself?\nDefinitely not to be imposed, being a demon\nBecause this is the joy of believin'\nMan, to believe in yourselves\nBut for sure, the higher power\nResides only to ride in the heart of the true\nFrom the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi\nIn the poetry, or in it's realm\nThat's what pulls all words together\nJust to understand that every man is his own man\nAnd only man can satisfy the man\nOnly the soul of the man, the feelings of the man\nThe for realness of the man\nYou can't shake the man when you give the man\nYou know the man\nAnd you gotta call yourself, because you are that man\n[Chorus]\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God\nBlessed and still breathin'\n(blessed and still breathin)\n(even though it's hard)\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God\n(before I'm leavin')\nEven though it's hard\n(I'm askin' the grievin')\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nBlessed and still breathin'\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God\nBlessed and still breathin'\nEven though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nPut my faith in God\nThat's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\nBlessed and still breathin'\nThat's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?"
