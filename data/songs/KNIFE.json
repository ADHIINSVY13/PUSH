(Yeah)\nChain so long it touched the boy, your fate prolonged until I'm bored (Yeah)\nSo much fun, I'm overboard, you see just how they did the kid (Yee)\nGot a tip, they took the masses up the ladder, ain't that some shit? (Shit)\nBuy a pack and take a trip (Trip), \nlet it lay, we got the chips\n (Chips)\nShit get gully and shit gеt ugly, but I know you not gon' flip\n (Not gon' flip, whoa)\nPlenty of nights I seen you spaz (Whoa)\nTook 'em on the road, thеy chased my ass (Whoa)\n.32 humble, OJ half\nI done ran blocks like OJ did\nSaid you was down, but I know you flip\nYou a backstabber like a OJ hit, yeah (Yeah)\n[Chorus: Bobby Raps]\nTake the knife out of my back\nLook my killer in the eyes\n\n[Outro: Bobby Raps]\n(Aah, ah, aah, oh-oh, oh-oh)\n(Aah, ah, aah, oh-oh, oh-oh)"
