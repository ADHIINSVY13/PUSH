  "lyrics": "The motel is about a blank part of Bowie’s life, when he reminisced about the rapid and thrilling times and compared them to his more recent life (90’s).\n[Verse 1]\nFor we're living\nIn a safety zone\nDon't be holding back from me\nWe're living from hour to hour down here\nAnd we'll take it when we can\n[Verse 2]\nIt's a kind of living which recognises\nThe death of the odourless man\nWhen nothing is vanity nothing's too slow\nIt's not Eden but it's no sham\n[Chorus]\nThere is no hell\nThere is no shame\nThere is no hell\nLike an old hell\nThere is no hell\nAnd it's lights up, boys\nLights up boys\n[Verse 3]\nExplosion falls upon deaf ears\nWhile we're swimming in a sea of sham\nLiving in the shadow of vanity\nA complex fashion for a simple man\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd there is no hell\nAnd there is no shame\nAnd there is no hell\nLike an old hell\nThere is no hell\n[Verse 4]\nAnd the silence flies\nOn its brief flight\nA razor sharp crap shoot affair\nAnd we light up our lives\n[Chorus Variation]\nAnd there's no more of me exploding you\nRe-exposing you\nLike everybody do\nRe-exploding you\nI don't know what to use\nMake somebody move\nMe exploding\nMe exploding you"
