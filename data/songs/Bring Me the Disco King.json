  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou promised me the ending would be clear\nYou'd let me know when the time was now\nDon't let me know when you're opening the door\nStab me in the dark, let me disappear\nMemories that flutter like bats out of hell\nStab you from the city spires\nLife wasn't worth the balance\nOr the crumpled paper it was written on\n[Refrain]\nDon't let me know we're invisible\nDon't let me know we're invisible\n[Verse 2]\nHot cash days that you trailed around\nCold, cold nights under chrome and glass\nLed me down a river of perfumed limbs\nSent me to the streets with the good time girls\n[Refrain]\nDon't let me know we're invisible\nDon't let me know we're invisible\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe could dance, dance, dance through the fire\nDance, dance, dance through the fire\n\n[Chorus]\nFeed me no lies\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you\nBreathe through the years\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you\nBring me the \ndisco king\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you\nDead or alive, bring me the disco king\nBring me the disco king, bring me the disco king\nBring me the disco king\n[Verse 3]\nSpin-offs with those who slept like corpses\nDamp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs\nKilling time in the '70s\nSmelling of love through the moist winds\nDon't let me know when you're opening the door\nClose me in the dark, let me disappear\nSoon there'll be nothing left of me\nNothing left to release\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDance, dance, dance through the fire\nDance, dance, dance through the fire\n[Chorus]\nFeed me no lies\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you\nBreathe through the years\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you\nBring me the disco king\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you\nDead or alive, bring me the disco king\nBring me the disco king\nBring me the disco king, bring me the disco king\nBring me the disco king, bring me the disco king\nBring me the disco king, bring me the disco king"
