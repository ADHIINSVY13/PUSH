  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen the sun goes down on my side of town\nThat lonesome feeling comes to my door\nThe whole world turns blue\nThere's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks\nI've got a table for two way in the back\nWhere I sit alone and think of you\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI spend most every night\nBeneath the light of a neon moon\n[Chorus]\nIf you lose your one and only\nThere's always room here for the lonely\nTo watch your broken dreams\nDance in and out of the beams of a neon moon\n[Verse 2]\nI think of two young lovers running wild and free\nI close my eyes, and sometimes see\nYou in the shadows of this smoke-filled room\nNo telling how many tears I've sat here and cried\nOr how many lies that I've lied\nTelling my poor heart you'll come back one day\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI spend most every night\nBeneath the light of a neon moon\n[Chorus]\nIf you lose your one and only\nThere's always room here for the lonely\nTo watch your broken dreams\nDance in and out of the beams of a neon moon\n[Outro]\nBut I'll be alright as long as there's light\nFrom a neon moon\nAnd I'll be alright as long as there's light\nFrom a neon moon"
