  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was in my new house placing daydreams\nPatching up the crack along the wall\nI pass it and lose track of what I'm saying\n'Cause that's where I was when I got the call\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'\nIn the streets, there's a raging riot\nWhen it's \"Burn the bitch,\" they're shrieking\nWhen the truth comes out, it's quiet\n[Chorus]\nSo, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst\nAnd tried to tell the town\nSo they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say\nDo you believe me now?\n[Verse 2]\nI was in my tower weaving nightmares\nTwisting all my smiles into snarls\nThey say, \"What doesn't kill you makes you aware\"\nWhat happens if it becomes who you are?\n[Chorus]\nSo, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst\nAnd tried to tell the town\nSo they set my life in flames, I regret to say\nDo you believe me now?\n\n[Bridge]\nThey knew, they knew, they knew the whole time\nThat I was onto somethin'\nThe family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line\nThey all said nothin'\nBlood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll\nBet they never spared a prayer for my soul\nYou can mark my words that I said it first\nIn a mourning warning, no one heard\n[Verse 3]\nI patched up the crack along the wall\nI pass it and lose track of what I'm saying\n'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all\n[Chorus]\nSo, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst\nAnd tried to tell the town\nSo they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say\nDo you believe me now?\n[Post-Chorus]\nAh, ah, ah\nI was onto somethin'\nAh, ah\nThey all said nothin'\nBlood's thick but nothin' like a payroll\nBet they never spared a prayer for my soul\nYou can mark my words that I said it first\nIn a mourning warning, no one heard\nNo one heard, not a single word was heard\n\n[Outro]\nWhen the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'\nIn the streets, there's a raging riot\nWhen it's \"Burn the bitch,\" they're shrieking\nWhen the truth comes out, it's quiet\nIt's so quiet"
