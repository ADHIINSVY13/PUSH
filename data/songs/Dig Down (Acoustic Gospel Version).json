  "lyrics": "Dig Down (Acoustic Gospel Version) was first played live at “Later… With Jools Holland”. This version changes the synth for a piano and a gospel chorus.\n[Verse 1]\nWhen hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground\nYou must find a way\nWhen the darkness descends and you're told it's the end\nYou must find a way\nWhen God decides to look the other way\nAnd a clown takes the throne\nWe must find a way\nFace the firing squad, against all the odds\nWe must find a way\n[Chorus]\nDig down\nDig down\nDig down and find faith\nWhen you're close to the edge\nWith a gun to your head\nYou must find a way\n[Verse 2]\nWhen friends are thin on the ground and they try to divide us\nWe must find a way\nWe have entered the fray and we will not obey\nWe must find a way, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDig down\nDig down\nDig down and find faith\nWhen they've left you for dead and you can only see red\nWe must find a way\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nDig down\nDig down\nDig down, find faith\nWe won't let them divide, we will never abide\nWe must find a way\n[Outro]\nDig down (Woah-oh-oh)\nDig down (Woah-oh-oh)\nDig down (Woah-oh-oh)\nFaith (Woah-oh-oh)\nDig down (Woah-oh-oh)\nDig down (Woah-oh-oh-oh)\nFaith"
