  "lyrics": "Mean ol’ moon\nIt must be fun\nTo shine upon me\nAs I come undone\nTil I’m all alone\nBeneath the sun\nYou mean ol’ moon\nWith your beam\nYou led the way\nAnd found me love I thought was\nHear to say\nThen you went and took\nMy love away\nYou mean ol’ moon\nOh you mean ol’ stars above\nThe games that you play with me\nI could find some happiness\nIf all of my nights were cloudy\nMean ol’ moon\nI hope it’s true\nYou’re taking all the light that’s left in you\nAnd saving it up for you know who\nYou mean ol’ moon\n\nMean ol’ moon\nI hope it’s true\nYou’re taking all the light that’s left in you\nAnd saving it up for you know who\nYou mean ol’ moon\nYou mean ol’ moon"
