  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou are that gentle breeze on a summer's day\nYou are the beat inside my heart\nYou are that place that I go when\nI need someone that's real\n[Chorus]\nI want you to know\nThat's the way I feel\n[Verse 2]\nI can look in your eyes and see every dream I've dreamed\nI can see peace inside your fire\nI can see joy in my life then only your love can reveal\n[Chorus]\nI want you to know\nThat's the way I feel\n[Verse 3]\nLife's mystery\nHow lucky I am that your love has found me\nAnd more\nYou are the key that opens the door to a world of memories\nAnd yes, I find that this is my moment, my time\nTo really let you know the way you make me feel\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Bridge]\nYou are that place that I go\nWhen I need someone that's real\nA soft and gentle touch\nA lover's hand to hold\nYour the passion in my life is real\n[Chorus]\nI want you to know\nThat's the way I feel"
