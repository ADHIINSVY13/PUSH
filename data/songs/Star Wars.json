Does a plant grow from a pot? Yes\nDo trees grow from a forest? MC's\n \ny'all are clitoris\nY'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin' any crew\nDoin' whatever's trendy, even they envy me too\nAin't enough room in this town\nWhat is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns? Star Wars\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars\n'Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out\n[Verse 3]\nThis ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police\nNot what you read in tabloid seats\nThese are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it\nBecause the game was supposed to be sold, we live it\nCame from the streets we the voice of the youth\nAmerica's nightmare was given a mic booth\nNike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars\nRappers not dependin' on your nine to five jobs\nEntertainment, this is our world, this is our language\nDifferent regions speakin' east and west gang shit\nYou got your positive shit like, Common Sense\nBut even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube\nAcknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules\nWhat you think is different from the block whenever we feud\nFuck your pictures and your plaques, your tours and autographs\nDon't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that\n'Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin' it's safe\nTo run in your release party sprayin' the place\nOr catch you when you least on point, puttin' your keys in the door\nBehind you with your seeds in KB Toys store\nMaybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you\n\"You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you\"\nNext mornin' every news channel and front page\nHeadlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars"
