I meant what I said\nHoldin' the poison down\nHoldin' the poison down\n[Verse 2]\nI get the feelin' there ain't nothing that I can do\nNothing'll get me through\nSo blue\nSometimes I dream, I can dream, I can dream\nAnd then I bleed, and I bleed, and I bleed\nI get the feeling there ain't nothing that I can do\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI spin around, around, around\nSpin around, around, around\nSpin around, around (And then)\nOut of the blue\n[Chorus]\nHoldin' the poison down\nHoldin' the poison down\nSomething to drown you out\nI'm holdin' thе poison down\nYou know I want what I want, I get what I get\nYou know what I mean? I mеant what I said\nHoldin' the poison down\nHoldin' the poison down\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStand around, around, around\nStand around, around, around\nStand around, around (And then)\nOut of the blue\n[Chorus]\nHoldin' the poison down\nHoldin' the poison down\nSomething to drown you out\nI'm holdin' the poison down\nYou know I want what I want, I get what I get\nYou know what I mean? I meant what I said\nHoldin' the poison down\nHoldin' the poison down"
