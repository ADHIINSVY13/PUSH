  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI know sometimes you're scared of the light\nBut, how will you ever know if you never try?\nThere's something new inside my heart\nAnd it cries like a child whenever we're apart\nI've seen your face under every sky\nI find the less I look, the more I find\n[Chorus]\nSo let's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\nYou're the only one I want\nLet's go back there, back to the start\nYou know I'm never gonna leave you\n'Cause you're the only one I want\n[Verse 2]\nYou know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark\nBut, I'm fearless and brave when I'm in your arms\nYou said my name in the dead of glory\nYou hold me upright\nWhen I'm strong or falling\n[Chorus]\nSo let's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\n'Cause you're the only one I want\nLet's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\n'Cause you're the only one I want\n\n[Bridge]\nThere will be times\nWhen we'll try and give it up\nBursting at the seams\nNo doubt that we'll almost fall apart\nThen burn the pieces\nAnd we'll watch them turn to dust\nBut, without each other, nothing else is enough\n[Chorus]\nSo let's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\n'Cause you're the only one I want\nLet's go back there, back to the start\nI swear I'm never gonna leave you\n'Cause you're the only one I want\n[Outro]\nYou're the only one\nNever gonna leave you\nNo, I'm never gonna leave you, no"
