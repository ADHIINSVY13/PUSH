  "lyrics": "Sweet little woman can't you see\nThat you're the only one for me\nYou make me feel good, so good inside\nStay by me woman for the rest of my life\nAnd as I think of you more every day\nThere's only one thing I can say\nAnd that's:\nGirl, I think the world about you\nAlways thinkin' of you\nGirl, I think the world about you\nI'm always thinkin' of you\nSo many wonders in your world it seems\nYou're the picture of a woman - a little girl's dream\nYou seem so weak sometimes to be so strong\nYou make a man like me finally to belong\nNo words can say how much I need you so\nBut oh my love I want the world to know\nGirl, I think the world about you\nAlways thinkin' of you\nGirl, I think the world about you\nI'm always thinkin' of you\nThere's no words to say how much I need you so\nBut oh sweet girl I want the world to know\n\nGirl, I think the world about you\nAlways thinkin' of you\nGirl, I think the world about you\nI'm always thinkin' of you"
