Hungry as hell, tryna eat now\nSuccess is the only thing that can complete us\nGrindin' to free us, \nthe beat knockin' like a fetus\nClose your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (\nLogic\n)\nNow I've accepted I'm not from the hood\n'Cause sellin' crack and bustin' gats don't make my raps good\nSee, this is me, L-O-G-I-C, reppin' MD to the fullest\nPush us to the limit, but never pull us now\nI can't wait 'til I see my name in neon\nThat fly shit I be on, flowin' for eons\nEvery day I take chances, Celine Dion\nSaid every day I take chances, Celine Dion\n, let's get it\nI'm a diamond in the rough, but I shine like disco\nSurrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco\nI haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?\nUp a million percent until they finally hear this though\nBumpin' up in they city like, \"Oh my God, this go\"\nMy business gettin' better every year like fiscal\nFuck the pad and the pen, the mic my only utensil\nI'm a original, see, but they trace like stencil\nA stain in the game, but you fade like pencil\nBitin' off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult\n'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end, that's just your fault\nIt takes three millions years for a diamond to shine\nI did it in twenty-one, see, I'm ahead of my time\n'Cause when I flow, the crowd never roll 'cause I rock\nOn the road to success, haters in my blind spot\n'Cause I got no time to bullshit\n\n[Chorus: Joanna Newsom]\nWe should shine a light on, a light on\nAnd the book of right-on's right on, it was right on"
