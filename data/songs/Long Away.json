  "lyrics": "[Intro]\n[Verse 1]\nYou might believe in heaven\nI would not care to say\nFor every star in heaven\nThere's a sad soul here today\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWake up in the morning with a good face\nStare at the moon all day\nLonely as a whisper on a star chase\nDoes anyone care anyway\nFor all the prayers in heaven\nSo much of life's this way\n[Chorus]\nDid we leave our way behind us\nSuch a long, long way behind us\nWho knows when\nNow who knows where\nWhere the light of day will find us?\nLook for the day\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 2]\nTake heart, my friend, we love you\nThough it seems like you're alone\nA million lights above you\nSmile down upon your home\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHurry, put your troubles in a suitcase\nCome let the new child play\nLonely as a whisper on a star chase\nI'm leaving here, I'm long away\nFor all the stars in heaven\nI would not live, I could not live this way\n[Chorus]\nDid we leave our way behind us?\nSuch a long, long way behind us\nLeave it for some hopeless lane\n[Outro]\n(Such a long, long way\nSuch a long, long way\nSuch a long, long way)\nSuch a long, long away\nI'm looking for, looking for that day"
