  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell, she looked a peach in the dress she made\nWhen she was still her mama's little girl\nAnd when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled\nAt her innocence and curls\nAnd when the preacher said, \"Is there anyone here\nGot a reason why they shouldn't wed?\"\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI shoulda stuck up my hand\nI shoulda got up to stand\nAnd this is what I should have said\n[Chorus]\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nLong before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine\nDon't say, \"I do\", say, \"bye, bye, bye\"\nAnd lemme kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\n[Verse  2]\nUnderneath her veil, I could see a tear\nTricklin' down her pretty face\nAnd when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything\nWould never be the same again\nBut if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit\nAbout his wife and the things we did\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd what I planned to say\nYeah, on her weddin' day\nWell, I thought it, but I kept it hid\n[Chorus]\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nLong before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine\nDon't say, \"I do\", say, \"bye, bye, bye\"\nAnd lemme kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\n[Chorus]\nOh, I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nLong before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine\nDon't say, \"I do\", say, \"bye, bye, bye\"\nAnd lemme kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\n[Outro]\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!\nI wanna kiss the bride, yeah!"
