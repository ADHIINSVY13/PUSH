  "lyrics": "A country dance was being held in a garden\nI felt a bump and heard an \"Oh, beg your pardon\"\nSuddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams\nAll around a pug-nosed dream\nThe music started and was I the perplexed one\nI held my breath and said, \"May I have the next one?\"\nIn my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams\nSparkled on a pug-nosed dream\nThere were questions in the eyes of other dancers\nAs we floated over the floor\nThere were questions, but my heart knew all the answers\nAnd perhaps a few things more\nNow in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter\nI know the meaning of the words \"ever after\"\nAnd I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams\nWhen I kiss the pug-nosed dream"
