  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nFunny how secrets travel\nI'd start to believe\nIf I were to bleed\nThin skies, the man chains his hands held high\nCruise me blond\nCruise me, babe\nA blond belief beyond beyond beyond\nNo return, no return\nI'm deranged\nDeranged, down, down, down\nI'm deranged, down, down, down\nSo cruise me, babe; cruise me, baby\n[Chorus]\nAnd the rain sets in\nIt's the angel-man\nI'm deranged\nCruise me, cruise me, cruise me, babe\n[Verse 2]\n(This one will never be down)\nThe clutch of life and the fist of love\nOver your head\nBig deal Salaam\nBe real deranged Salaam\nBefore we reel\nI'm deranged\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd the rain sets in\nIt's the angel-man\nI'm deranged\nAnd the rain sets in\nIt's the angel-man\nI'm deranged\nCruise me, cruise me, cruise me, babe\n[Outro]\nI'm deranged"
