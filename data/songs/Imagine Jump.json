I've seen the toughest around\nAnd I know, baby, just how you feel\nYou've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real\nOh can't you see me standing here?\nI've got my back against the record machine\nCan't you see what i mean?\nCan't you see what i mean?\n[Chorus]\nMight as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nLet him jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nMight as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nLet him jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\n[Verse 2]\nHello! Hey you! Who said that?\nBaby how you been?\nYou say you don't know where we're going until we begin\nOh can't you see me standing here?\nI've got my back against the record machine\nCan't you see what i mean?\nCan't you see what i mean?\n\n[Chorus]\nMight as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nLet him jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nMight as well jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump\nLet him jump (Jump!)\nGo ahead and jump"
