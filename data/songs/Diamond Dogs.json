I'll keep a friend serene\n(Will they come?) \nOh baby, come on to me\n(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone\nCome out of the garden, baby\nYou'll catch your death in the fog\nYoung girl, \nthey call them the Diamond Dogs\nYoung girl, \nthey call them the Diamond Dogs\n[Verse 2]\nThe Halloween Jack is a real cool cat\nAnd he lives on top of Manhattan Chase\nThe elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope\nOnto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go\nMeet his little hussy\n \nwith his ghost town approach\nHer face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch\nSweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake\nWrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised\n\n[Chorus]\n(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene\n(Will they come?) \nOh baby, come on to me\n(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone\nCome out of the garden, baby\nYou'll catch your death in the fog\nYoung girl, \nthey call them the Diamond Dogs\nYoung girl, \nthey call them the Diamond Dogs\n[Bridge]\n(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs\n(Oo-oo-ooh) call them the Diamond Dogs\nOh, hoo!\nAwoooooo!\nWoof! Woof!\n[Verse 3]\nIn the year of the scavenger,\n \nthe season of the bitch\nSashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch\nJust another future song, lonely little kitsch\n(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow\n[Chorus]\n(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene\n(Will they come?) \nOh baby, come on to me\n(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone\nCome out of the garden, baby\nYou'll catch your death in the fog\nYoung girl, \nthey call them the Diamond Dogs\nYoung girl, \nthey call them the Diamond Dogs\n\n[Outro]\nOo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs\nOo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs\nBow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow\nCall them the Diamond Dogs\nDogs!\nCall them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them\nCall them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooh hoo!\nCall them the Diamond Dogs\nKeep cool, \nDiamond Dogs rule, OK\nHey! Hey! Hey! Hey!\n(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)\n(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)\n(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)\n(Beware of the Diamond Dogs)"
