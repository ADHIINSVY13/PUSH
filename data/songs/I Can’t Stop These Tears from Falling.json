  "lyrics": "I used to go out at night\nI used to go out each day\nI used to go out & feel the sun on the silent day\nSo it's coming as quite a shock\nA heart could come so undone\nThe strings could unravel fast\nHow quickly the war is won\n& I can't stop these tears from falling\nRight away\nI know you're calling\nI can't stop these tears from falling now\nIf I was the thinking heart\n& you were the loving soul\nWith all of my feelings sharp\nYou came crashing in my world\nA music of cathedrals\nBouncing along the glass\nIt's echoing through my ears\nYou took it away so fast\nOh well\nThe lights are low\n& I don't need a friend to call my own\n'cause I know it's the end\nIt's the end"
