Pick me up, throw me!\nLift me up, hold me, just like you told me\nYou was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful\nI'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & \nDMX\n]\nNow go to sleep, bitch, die, motherfucker, die\nUgh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes\nGo to sleep, bitch (\nWhat?\n), why are you still alive?\nHow many times I gotta say, \"Close your eyes\"?\nAnd go to sleep, bitch (\nWhat?\n), die, motherfucker, die\nBye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye\nGo to sleep, bitch (\nWhat?\n), why are you still alive?\nWhy?
