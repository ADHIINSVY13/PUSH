  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe used to call me DN\nThat stood for Deadly Nightshade\n'Cause I was filled with poison\nBut blessed with beauty and rage\nJim told me that, \nhe hit me and it felt like a kiss\nJim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids\n[Chorus]\nWith his ultraviolence\nUltraviolence\nUltraviolence\nUltraviolence\nI can hear sirens, sirens\nHe hit me and it felt like a kiss\nI can hear violins, violins\nGive me all of that ultraviolence\n[Verse 2]\nHe used to call me poison\nLike I was poison ivy\nI could have died right there\n'Cause he was right beside me\nJim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love\nJim taught me that, loving him was never enough\n\n[Chorus]\nWith his ultraviolence\nUltraviolence\nUltraviolence\nUltraviolence\nI can hear sirens, sirens\nHe hit me and it felt like a kiss\nI can hear violins, violins\nGive me all of that ultraviolence\n[Bridge]\nWe could go back to New York\nLoving you was really hard\nWe could go back to Woodstock\nWhere they don't know who we are\nHeaven is on Earth\nI would do anything for you, baby\nBlessed is this union\nCrying tears of gold like lemonade\n[Interlude]\nI love you the first time, I love you the last time\nYo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines\n'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader\nI love you forever, I love you forever\n\n[Chorus]\nWith his ultraviolence\n \n(Lay me down tonight)\nUltraviolence\n \n(In my linen and curls)\nUltraviolence\n \n(Lay me down tonight)\nUltraviolence\n \n(Riviera Girls)\nI can hear sirens, sirens\nHe hit me and it felt like a kiss\nI can hear violins, violins\nGive me all of that ultraviolence"
