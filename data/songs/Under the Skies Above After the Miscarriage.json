  "lyrics": "My child is out there somewhere\nunder the skies above\nwaiting anxiously 4 u and me\n2 bless it with our love\nA part of me a part of u\nand a part of this love we share\nwill protect my unborn child\nwho lives dormant out there somewhere\nSometimes in my dreams\nI imagine what it would be like\nHow could I properly guide him\nwhen even I don't know what's right\nWhether he is born in wealth or poverty\nthere will be no deficiency in love\nI welcome this gift of life\ngiven from GOD under the skies above"
