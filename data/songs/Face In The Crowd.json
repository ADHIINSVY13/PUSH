  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm just a face in the crowd\nYou probably don't know me as I don't stand out\nAnd I'm sure your heart doesn't beat for me, no\nAnd when you're cold and lonely\nThey are not my arms you long to feel around you\nTo keep you safe and warm\nNo, I'm just a face in the crowd you can't see\n[Chorus]\nSave a little love for me\nSave a little love for me, yeah\nSave a little love for me, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd I'll save my love for you, my face in the crowd\n[Verse 2]\nI don't know your name and you don't know mine\nYet I'm wearing our initials round this heart of mine\nI don't need no proof to know that you are there, yeah\nMy heart is strong and my wings are wide\nI'm true to all my colors and I wear them all with pride\nI am your face, your face in the crowd\n[Chorus]\nSave a little love for me\nSave a little love for me, yeah\nSave a little love for me, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd I'll save my love for you, my face in the crowd\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn the twilight sometimes we meet\nJust before we wake or as we fall asleep\nI still can't see your face and I know you can't see mine\nBut I can feel your heartbeat, you can hear my voice\nYou touch my soul and my soul touches yours\nAnd we make a promise somewhere down the line\nSomewhere down the line\n[Chorus]\nSave a little love for me\nSave a little love for me, yeah\nSave a little love for me, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd I'll save my love for you, my face in the crowd\n[Verse 4]\nI don't know the color of your skin\nBut I've felt the love that lies within\nAnd I'm sure I know without a doubt\nI'll find your face in the crowd\nI'll never let this feeling slide\nAnd no one can put my faith aside\nI'm sure I know without a doubt\n[Chorus 2] [x2]\nI'll find your face in the crowd\nYour face in the crowd\n\n[Outro]\nI'm just a face in the crowd\nYou probably don't know me as I don't stand out"
