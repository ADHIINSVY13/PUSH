  "lyrics": "Drivin' at night, you feel as if you're blind\nThe sun is gone and it's stuck in your mind\nYou look to the morning with expectation\nAnticipation\nWhen you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here\nYou feel your spirit sing, you know there's nothing to fear\nI'm here by your side, I've got to no where to go\nSo take your time, drive slow, listen to the radio\nTalk if you want, if don't just change the station\nI got patience\nI tell myself wait\nWait till the sun goes down\nWait and you'll come around\nAnd you'll smile for everyone\nI'll make you a place\nA place where the shadows fall\nCan be anyone or no one at all\nJust tell me what you want\nI know, sometimes you feel the need to beware\nI know that you scared that I care\nBut I wonder who you're with when you turn out the lights\nWho do you think of at night\n\nWhen you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here\nI've been there before and you've got nothing to fear\nI'll make you a place where the shadows fall\nAnd you can be anyone or no one at all\nWe'll take solace from the burning sun\nLet me be there for you just this once\nI tell myself wait\nWait till the sun goes down\nWait and you'll come around\nAnd you'll smile for everyone\nI'll make you a place\nA place where the shadows fall\nCan be anyone or no one at all\nJust tell me what you want"
