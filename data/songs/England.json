  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt is opening day and a brand new start\nThe stones have been cleared around the fisherman's hut\nAnd the air bites, then leaves almost invisible cuts on the skin\nA lighthouse retired, but a new one was hired\nAbout twenty foot taller, painted in black and white\nTwenty million steps with a computer inside instead of him\n[Chorus]\nOnly one road sign tellin' cars to slow down\nAnd a long drop in the ocean\nBeware of the riptide, broken glass and train lines\nIt's a new day and this is England\n[Verse 2]\nNext to the pub with the flag that's workin' flexible hours\n'Cause there's a mismatch of carriages, soil in a boat for some flowers\nFairy lights on a building that's supplyin' us power from the sea\nElectricity lines flow like veins to the town\nIn between, there is nothin' but grass and pebbles on the ground\nDo not enter the wild here if you want to be found for the free\n[Chorus]\nView the flame of sunrise cut in half by the sky\nAnd the empty of the desert\nTeam of birds that swerve by and then land on the wires\nIt's a new day and this is England\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen it's time to escape from the heavy of this\nThere is nothin' like washin' away\nI find this country of mine gets a bad reputation\nOf bein' cold and grey\nBut on the coast of the south to the east followed 'round\nI find serenity I've never felt\nThere's a peace and a quiet in this island of ours\nThat can't be mirrored by anywhere else\n[Verse 3]\nHomes protruding from stones with their wood coloured black\nScattered cars in the line, steam risin' out the shack\nOne door at the front and then just glass out the back for the view\n[Chorus]\nAnd the blue is so bright, you'll need shades for your eyes\nAnd a cable to pull over\nTake a walk and feel like everything will be fine\nIt's a new day and this is England"
