Yeah, I made it\nFirst I made you who you are and then I made it\nAnd you're wasted with your latest\nYeah, I'm the reason why you always gettin' faded\n[Chorus]\nTake a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)\nTake a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)\nTake a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nA shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nA shot for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nOkay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you\nYou and the music were the only things that I'd commit to\nI never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you\nBut you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you\nShe says, \"I know you changed\nI never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things\"\nI really wish she had a different way of viewin' things\nI think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things\nIt's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen\nThe men are jealous and the women all in competition\nAnd all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret\nAnd taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect\nI could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer\nPrayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh\nThis is one I know you hated when you heard it\nAnd it's worse because you know that I deserve it\n[Chorus]\nTake a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)\nTake a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)\nTake a shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nA shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nA shot for me\n[Outro]\nYeah\nMay your neighbors respect you\nTrouble neglect you\nAngels protect you\nAnd Heaven accept you"
