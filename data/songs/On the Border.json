  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCruising down the center of a two way street\nWondering who is really in the driver's seat\nMinding my business along comes big brother\nSays, son, you better get on one side or the other\n[Chorus]\nI'm out on the border, i'm walking the line\nDon't you tell me about your law and order\nI'm trying to change this water to wine\n[Verse 2]\nAfter a hard day, i'm safe at home\nFooling with my baby on the telephone\nOut of nowhere somebody cuts in and\nSays, \"hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been.\"\n[Chorus]\nI'm out on the border, I thought this was a private line\nDon't you tell me about your law and order\nI'm trying to change this water to wine\n[Bridge]\nNever mind your name, just give us your number, mm\nNever mind your face, just show us your card, mm\nAnd we wanna know whose wing are you under\nYou better step to the right or we can make it hard\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm stuck on the border\nAll I wanted was some peace of mind\nDon't you tell me 'bout your law and order\nI'm trying to change this water to wine\n[Outro]\nOn the border\nOn the border\nOn the border\nOn the border\nOn the border\nLeave me be , i'm just walking this line\nOn the border\nOn the border\nAll i wanted was some peace of mind, peace of mind\nI'm out on the border\nOn the border\nCan't you see i'm trying to change this water to wine\nOn the border\nDon't you tell me 'bout your law and order\nSick and tired of all your law and order\nOn the border\nSick and tired of it\nOn the border\nI'm the man on the border\nOn the border"
