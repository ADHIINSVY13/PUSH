Should I pinch you?\nAfter all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah\nLook what you've done, look what you've done\nLook what you've done for me now, yeah\nYou knew that I was gon' be somethin'\nWhen you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah\nLook what you've done, look what you've done\nLook what you've, look what you've\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade\nAnd I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade\nAnd my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way\nOver some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn\nBoohoo, sad story, Black American dad story\nKnow that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me\nI remember sneaking in your pool after school dances\nDamn, your house felt like the Hamptons\nFor all of my summer romances\nI never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit\nMade the world I know bigger\nChanged the way that I viewed it\nHad all this fightin' going on at the crib\nYou would calm me down when I lose it\nTold you I think I'm done acting\nNow I'm more in touch with the music\nYou said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far\nTalked to me, then you got to me\nThen you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah\nJust a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested\nJust another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted\nBut I could do anything\nYou said that, and you meant that\nYou took me places, you spent that\nThey said no, we went back\nChecks bounced, but we bounced back\nI put all the money in your accounts back\nAnd I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that\nIt worked out, man, you deserve it\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this shit real? Should I pinch you?\nAfter all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah\nLook what you've done, look what you've done\nLook what you've done for me now, yeah\nYou knew that I was gon' be somethin'\nWhen you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah\nLook what you've done, look what you've done\nLook what you've, look what you've\n[Outro: Drake's Grandmother]\nHi Aubrey\nI'm here sitting with my son having a little talk\nAnd he knew, knows how to get in touch with you now\nTo let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this\nIn this comfortable place\nAll I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together\nAnd the times I used to look after you\nAnd I still have wonderful feeling about that\nSo God bless you\nAnd I hope I'll see you"
