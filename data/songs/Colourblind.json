  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nKaleidoscope love, yeah, that is you and me\nForever changing, we make life interesting\nSome days, we're red and some days, we both think green\nBut I like the nights when we leave the canvas free\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGrab a brush and see where the feelin' may lead\nNothin' is out of our reach\nOur words are mixing the pigment we need\nCan we get started?\n[Chorus]\nI keep fallin' deeper in dark blue\nBrighter than white, rainbows exploding\nBut I can't see nothin' еxcept you and your eyes\nMaybе we'll just paint the night colourblind\n[Verse 2]\nIn every spectrum, we find the millionth piece\nConnect the dots and everything in between\nMmm, dull in the moment, you'll turn it golden leaf\nYou take the dark away and that's no easy feat\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPick an orange, watch the shade change in the heat\nFrom yellow, purple and green\nYour words are mixin' each pigment we need\nCan we get started?\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep falling deeper in dark blue\nBrighter than white, rainbows exploding\nBut I can't see nothin' except you and your eyes\nMaybe we'll just paint the night colourblind\n[Outro]\nMmm\nMaybe we'll just paint the night colourblind"
