[laughs] it's funny, I've recently seen people talk about who they think it's about and I'm like \"what are you talking about?\" It's actually not about anybody I know, it's not about anybody that I've ever had a friendship or a relationship with, it's about people, types of people, and... yeah, I don't know, it's like, I'm not really gonna talk about what it's actually about, \nbut\n it's just a fun one. It's just like a \"don't take me seriously\" song [laughs]."
