Nigga, there’s no replacement\nBesides my kids, boundaries are my greatest creation\nI been on fire four generations\nIt’s Nas 'til I’m gone, give my all, give 'em more\nMiles on my Peloton, I been working on my core\nColors of Benetton, pastel rugs on the floor\nMeal prep me, Ferrari Testi\nShe out on the terrace, glass of Petrus with her bestie\nDrunk textin' while I’m out here tryna spread the message\nYou searchin' for qualities that I’m already blessed with\nR&B exes, charms on her necklace\n\n[Interlude: Nas]\nGod’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)\nGod’s Son across the belly ('Cross the belly, 'cross the belly)\nWeight of the world\nEmbrace the pressure\n[Outro: Don Toliver]\nPressure\nI can feel pressure\nJust a little bit, yeah"
