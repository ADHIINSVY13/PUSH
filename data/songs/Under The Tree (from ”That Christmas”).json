  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm alone this December, it's the last light of the day\nOh, I can't help but wonder if you feel the same\nOh, I guess I'll surrender to the tears and the pain\nAnd the cold we are under will remain\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were the hearth light, my fire that died\nWaiting for morning sunrise\n[Chorus]\nThere is nothing under the tree that I wished for\nI want you to come back to me and be like before\nHave I lost you? And nothin' will ever fill the hole\nMy heart will be here under the tree, just letting you know\n[Post-Chorus]\nMm, mm, mm\n[Verse 2]\nI'm alone this December, and the long nights, they begin\nStill, my mind's overthinking, now, whose arms you're in?\nAnd were mine just an afterthought of needing to be kind?\nGuess when we're out of sight, it's outta mind\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were the first touch, first look in my eyes\nNow we're just strangers who walk by\n\n[Chorus]\nThere is nothing under the tree that I wished for\nI want you to come back to me and be like before\nHave I lost you? Nothin' will ever fill the hole\nMy heart will be here under the tree, just letting you know\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were the first touch, first look in my eyes\nNow we're just strangers who walk by\n[Chorus]\nThere is nothing under the tree that I wished for\nI want you to come back to me and be like before\nHave I lost you? Nothin' will ever fill the hole\nMy heart will be here under the tree, just letting you know\n[Post-Chorus]\nMm, mm, mm"
