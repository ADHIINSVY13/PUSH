  "artist": "David Bowie",
  "lyrics": "“Breaking Glass” owes everything to guitarist Carlos Alomar in the left channel, who delivers the lead with a swagger to rival Mick Ronson and T. Rex\n[Verse 1]\nBaby, I've been\nBreaking glass in your room again\nListen\n[Verse 2]\nDon't look at the carpet\nI drew something awful on it\nSee\n[Bridge]\nYou're such a wonderful person\nBut you got problems\nI'll never touch you"
