my\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick\n[Verse 1]\nFight the power, fight the power\nFight for the right to get up and say fuck white power\nEverybody come and get up, get on\nAnd no matter what you fighting for I promise that it’ll live on\nLike make America great again\nMake it hate again\nMake it white\nMake everybody fight\nFuck that\nStreet’s disciple\nMy raps are trifle\nI shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain\nAnd everybody wonder why the world insane\nWhy the world insane\nWhy the world insane\nWhy the world insane\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick\n[Verse 2: Black Thought]\nThe world going mad over one drug\nI'm filling up a bag at the gun club\nIn the shadow of a nation that it once was\nAll this false information I'ma unplug, young blood\nIt is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov\nThe man in the high castle in a hot tub\nWe locked in a pine casket, it's botched up\nLike plastic surgery, \nclassic perjury\nThe way they can plead the fifth to the 13th\nAnd stop to search me, controversy\nThem boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker\n[Chorus: Logic]\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick\n[Verse 3: Chuck D]\nYoung blood, it takes another look and feel\nSlap that fear monger at that wheel\nOlive branches in the arrow seal\nAlternative facts mean to lie and steal\nGotta to go to ban the whole\nRefugee population from the land they stole\nIn the name of the government\nRich white man while the rest be suffering\nRun from the locked down borders\nAin’t like Flint ain’t got clean water\nDirty politics never come clean\nCan ya'll believe this shit in 2017?\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my dick\n[Verse 4: Logic]\nGeorge bush don't care about black people\n2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so\nShit, I'll say what Kanye won't\nWake the fuck up and give the people what they want\nMan it's all love but the youth is confused\nYour music is 20/20 but them political views\nIs blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred\n'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word\nBut I gotta say what need be said\n'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red\nI know some people wish I’d act white instead\nSay I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead\nFuck that, everything I do, I do it right\nTo teach the people that they have the power to fight\nAnd not with semi automatic bullets in the night\nSo everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact\nNobody treated equally, especially the black\nIf you don’t get it the first time, bring it back\nNow, everybody gotta fight for equal rights\n'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites\nTo make it happen though we gon' need patience\nAnd not violence, giving hospitals more patients now\nDon't burn down the mom and pop shop\nI'm just as angry another person got shot\nDon’t be angry at the color of they skin\nJust be happy that as a people we could begin again, and\nI’ma tell you what I need right now\nI’ma tell you what we all need\nI need my people of color...\nDon’t run from Trump, run against him\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nHey mothafucka I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick\n[Bridge: Logic]\nOhh, hands up for the 5-0\nOh, ohh, hands up for the 5-0\n[Verse 5: Logic & \nBig Lenbo\n]\nI been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck\nI don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a damn\nI just wanna live, I just wanna eat\nBut I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh\nDope in the trunk\nCreepin out the cut\n9 by the gut\nNever get enough\nI don’t give a fuck\nStupid mothafuckas move backwards\nMastered the hustle\nSomething in the duffle for you bastards\nGrind over chatter\nCheese on my mind like a packer\nOnly thing that matter, bitch scatter\nYou in my way, about to spray, the A-K\nMiddle of the day, like that shit’s okay\nNever had a job, never had a education\nOnly know probation\nNever had a job never had a education\nYeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one\nNo, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one\n[Interlude: No I.D. & \nLogic\n]\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nNow send the blacks back to Africa\nBuild a wall for the Mexicans\nSend the whites back to Europe\nGive the land to the Native American\nTake the skyscraper\nTear down the casino\nPrint your own paper\nAnd bear down on the gringo\nTake the skyscraper\nTake the skyscraper\nTear down the casino\nTear down the casino\nPrint your own paper\nPrint your own paper\nAnd bear down on the gringo\nAnd bear down on the, down on the, down on the\nTake the skyscraper\nThe skyscraper\nTear down the casino\nTear down the casino\nPrint your own paper\nPrint your own paper\nAnd bear down on the gringo\nBear down on the, down on the...\n[Chorus: Logic]\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my, off my\nHey mothafucka, I’m real as shit\nEverything I’m talkin' 'bout real as shit\nAw yeah, I’m back in this bitch\nAnd you don’t gotta like it but get off my"
