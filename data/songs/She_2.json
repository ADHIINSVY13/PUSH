Oh hallelujah\nThey use to walk singing songs by the river,,\nEven when she knew for sure\nShe had to go away\nAnd she never knew what her life had to give her\nAnd never had to worry about it\nFor one single day\nMy but she sure could sing\nOh yes, sure could sing\nShe had faith, she had believing\nLed all the people together in singing\nAnd she prayed every night to the Lord up above\nHallelujah. Oh hallelujah\nShe, she came from the land of the cotton\nLand that was nearly forgotten by everyone\nAnd she worked and she slaved so hard\nA big old field was her back yard in the delta sun\nOh, but she sure could sing\nMy, she sure could sing\nOh, but she sure could sing\nOh, but she sure could sing"
