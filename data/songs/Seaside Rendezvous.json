(Ooh, I'd like that)\nFantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs\nAnd at the peak of the season\nThe Mediterranean\nThis time of year, it's so fashionable\n[Instrumental break]\n[Verse 3]\nI feel like dancing in the rain\nCan I have a volunteer?\n(Just keep right on dancing)\nWhat a damn jolly good idea\nIt's such a jollification, \nas a matter of fact\nSo tr√®s charmant, my dear\n\n[Verse 4]\nUnderneath the moonlight\nTogether we'll sail across the sea\nReminiscing every night\nMeantime (And in the meantime, baby)\nI ask you to be my valentine\nYou say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can\nI'll be your Valentino\nWe'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino\nGet a new facial, start a sensational\n[Outro]\nSeaside rendezvous, so adorable\nSeaside rendezvous, ooh-ooh\nSeaside rendezvous,\n \ngive us a kiss"
