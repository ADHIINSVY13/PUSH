(Roll that faster, man)\nOne, two, three, four!\n(Oh, we gotta time that\nThe whole point of a count is that it's in time, innit?)\nOne, two, three, four!\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I watch you tangle every weekend\nIt might start different but it ends up the same\nOne minute, you're casually speaking\nThe next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame\nWith your jerrycan of words and tones\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd no one's gonna start a revolution\nSo we best leave it well alone\nAnd there's something that Frankie used to say\nApparently\n[Chorus]\nOh, he said, settle for the draw\nWell, you're not gonna get no more\nSo you should settle for a draw\nI told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure\nYou should settle for a draw\nWhy don't you settle for a draw?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, you're right, it is one set of rules for her\nAnd then another set for you\nBut that's just the way it is, I suppose\nAnd there's \nnowt\n you can do\nAnd let's not fall in the trap of answering back\nI am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner\nThat's for sure, \nso take the draw\nIf it's available\n, \nand if it sets on fire\nDon't get out your jerrycan of words and tones\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd no one's gonna start a revolution\nSo we best leave it well alone\nAnd there's something that Frankie used to say\nApparently\n[Chorus]\nOh, he said, settle for the draw\nWell, you're not gonna get no more\nSo you should settle for the draw\nI told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure\nYou should settle for the draw\nWhy don't you settle for the draw?"
