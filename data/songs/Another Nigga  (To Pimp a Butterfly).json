  "lyrics": "[Excerpt from \"Mortal Man\"]\nI remember you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn’t wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga"
