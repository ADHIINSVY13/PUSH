  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWatching the video that you sent me\nThe one where you're showering with wet hair dripping\nYou know that I'm obsessed with your body\nBut it's the way you smile that does it for me\n[Chorus]\nIt's so sweet, knowing that you love me\nThough we don't need to say it to each other, sweet\nKnowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair\nIt's so sweet\n[Verse 2]\nWatching the video, where you're lying\nIn your red lingerie, ten times nightly\nYou know I think your skin's the perfect color\nBut it's always your eyes that pull me under\n[Chorus]\nIt's so sweet, knowing that you love me\nThough we don't need to say it to each other, sweet\nKnowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair\nIt's so sweet\n[Bridge]\nAnd I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you\nAnd I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you\nAnd I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you\nAnd I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's so sweet, knowing that you love me\nThough we don't need to say it to each other, sweet\nKnowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair\nIt's so sweet"
