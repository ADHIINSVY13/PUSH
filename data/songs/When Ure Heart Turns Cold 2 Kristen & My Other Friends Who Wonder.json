  "lyrics": "pages 12 & 13\nWhen your heart turns cold\nit causes your soul 2 freeze\nSpreads throughout your spirit\nLike a ruthless feeling disease\nThe walls that once were down\nNow stand firm and tall\nSafe from hate/love, pain/joy\nuntil u feel nothing at all\nWhen ure heart turns cold\na baby's cry means nothing\nA dead corpse is trivial\nMothers neglecting children is daily\nLonliness becomes your routine friend\nDeath seems like tranquility\nSleeping is never pleasant\nif you even sleep at all\nu forget ideals and turn off the reason\n2 make sure the product is sold\nYou don't understand how I behave\nJust wait till your heart turns Cold!"
