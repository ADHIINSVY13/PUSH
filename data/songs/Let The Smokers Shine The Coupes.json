Phillips\nBird feathers done made me chief\nWhatever happened to black marquise?\nMight buy your bitch a jeep\nI can make you lose your sleep\nYou millionaires on just TV\nNow make it make sense to me\n[Chorus]\nIf money is the evil root\nLet the smokers shine the coupes\nRich bitches that love the boost\nI'm just here to find the truth\nIf kilograms is the proof\nI done sold the golden goose\nI got 'em, baby, I'm Jim Perdue\nCocaine's Dr. Seuss"
