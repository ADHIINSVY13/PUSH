  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWill you live like me, in a world run by desire?\nWill you wake from worldly dreams and not be tired?\nWill you work like me to lift the conversation higher?\nWill you be cool like water putting out the fire?\nHow can you be free from all this sorrow?\nWill the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd if angels don't have answers to your prayers\nOh, I will be there, oh I will be there\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if who you love don't want your love, well then...\nDo you cut a deal with love and run again?\nYou see, love contains the meaning of despair\nWill you think like me? Will you  have your mother's fire?\nMaybe the way we are will not be how you're wired\nWill we do right by you? Will you have what you require?\nTo make your days on this Earth be not so dire?\n[Chorus 2]\nCan you choose to lead if no one follows?\nAnd if we fell today, must you tomorrow?\nSanctify your answer not your prayer\nOh, I will be there, yeah, I will be there\nYeah, I will be there\n\n[Outro]\nAnd even when it all becomes too much\nWhen you're growing old and feeling out of touch\nListen to this song and just take care\nAnd know that I will be there, yeah, I will be there\nNo, I swear that I will, yeah, I promise I will\nLittle girl, I'm cryin'"
