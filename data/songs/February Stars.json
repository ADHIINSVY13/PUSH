  "lyrics": "Dave Grohl described “February Stars” as:\n\nJust a song about hanging on by the tips of your fingers and hoping you don’t slip and fall.\n[Verse 1]\nI'm hangin' on\nHere until I'm gone\nI'm right where I belong\nJust hangin' on\n[Verse 2]\nAnd even though\nWatched you come and go\nHow was I to know\nYou'd steal the show?\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nOne day, I'll have enough to gamble\nI'll wait to hear your final call\nAnd bet it all\n[Verse 1]\nI'm hangin' on\nHere until I'm gone\nRight where I belong\nJust hangin' on\n[Verse 3]\nEven though\nI pass this time alone\nSomewhere so unknown\nIt heals the soul\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nYou ask for walls, I'll build them higher\nWe'll lie in the shadows of them all\nI'd stand but they're much too tall\nAnd I fall\n[Chorus]\nFebruary stars\nFloatin' in the dark\nTemporary scars\nFebruary stars\nFebruary stars\nFloatin' in the dark\nTemporary scars\nFebruary stars\nFebruary stars\nFloatin' in the dark\nTemporary scars\nFebruary stars"
