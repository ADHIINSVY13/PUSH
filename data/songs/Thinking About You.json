  "lyrics": "Yesterday I saw the sun shining\nAnd the leaves were fallin' down softly\nMy cold hands needed a warm, warm touch\nAnd I was thinkin' about you\nBut here I am lookin' for signs to lead me\nYou hold my hand, but do you really need me?\nI guess it's time for me to let you go\nBut I'll be thinkin' about you\nI'll be thinkin' about you\nSo when you sail across the ocean waters\nAnd you reach the other side safely\nCould you smile a little smile for me?\n'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you\nI'll be thinkin' about you\nI'll be thinkin' about you\nI'll be thinkin' about you"
