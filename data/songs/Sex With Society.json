I came\n(Bye, ho!) I went\n(Hi, ho!) I came\n(Bye, ho!) I went\n(Hi, ho!) I came\n(Bye, ho!) I went\n(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)\n[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]\nAnd I see that you envy of me\nEnemigos don’t prosper\nBetter yet, they do die eventually\nIf I’m at the event you will leave\n‘Cause you know and I know that\nI go ham even if Muslims is seen\nIn my rearview I’m near you\nBut I don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?\nWith an oxygen mask, and\nThe masses keep saying I’m speaking for them\nAnd if you can imagine my madness\nThen you can see where I’ve been\nAnd the places the Louis has been\nAnd I swear I been doing this when\nYou was in pajamas, watching B-Barney and Friends\nAnd you couldn’t harm me even with ten\nWeapons of your choice riding in\nArmy tanks, you shot blanks\nAnd I shot back, make your duplex bend\nWhat the fuck you think? If I don’t think\nThen I’m right back where the city sin\nWhat the fuck you drink?\nThinking I can’t write these raps in the Lions’ Den\nWhen I hear that you lyin’, then?\nIt’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope\nYou go downhill, man, where’s your slope?\nGet thrown downhill tied to a rope\nTell the world to put intervals\nMan, I swear this the anecdote\nAnd they tell me that life is a bitch\nWho gives a shit when you know?\n\n[Bridge]\nI’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)\nI’mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)\nMy dick hard, her pussy wet\nI'mma keep the pussy wet (Yep)\n[Hook]\n(Hi, ho!) I came\n(Bye, ho!) I went\n(Hi, ho!) I came\n(Bye, ho!) I went\n(Hi, ho!) I came\n(Bye, ho!) I went\n(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)\n[Refrain]\nAnd I see that you envy of me\nDon’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually\nCause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen\nIn my rearview I’m near you\nBut I don't hear you, can you at least breathe?\n(Hi, ho!)\n(Bye, ho!)"
