Bill O'Reilly called Nas a “Pinhead” on his show The O'Reilly Factor, and Nas responded with this song against the entire network.\n[Audio sample]\n[Verse 1]\nThe sly fox, \ncyclops\nWe locked in an idiot box\nThe video slots broadcasting Waco Davidian plots\nThey own YouTube\n, MySpace\nWhen this ignorant shit going to stop?\nThey monopolizing news, your views\nAnd the channel you choose, propaganda, visual cancer\nThe eye in the sky, \nnumber 5 on the dial\nSecret agenda, frequency antenna, \nDr. Mindbender\nRemote control, soul controller, your brain holder\nSlave culture\n, game's over\nWhat's a fox characteristic? Slick shit, censored misinformation\nPimp the station, over-stimulation\nReception, deception, Comcast digital Satan\nThe fox has a bushy tail\nAnd Bush tells lies and \nfox-trots\nSo, I don't know what's real (what's real)\n[Chorus]\nWatch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins\nStop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box\nAnd \nunplug from the Matrix doctrine\nBut watch what you say, Big Brother is watching\nWatch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins\nStop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box\nAnd unplug from the Matrix doctrine\nBut watch what you say, Fox Five is watching\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Fear Factor got you all riled up\nO'Reilly?\n \nOh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up\nNetwork for child predators, setting them up\nMySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts\nY'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us\nAnd you own the Post, and y'all shit on us\nWhat is their net worth?\nThey're going to try to censor my next verse\nThrow them off the roof neck first\nWhile I'm clicking my cursor\nReading blogs about pressure they put on Universal\nIt gets worse\nWhile I'm clicking my mouse, while they kick in my house\nThey figured us out\n, why a nigga go south?\nIt's either he caught a body\nDon't sleep, they're watching\nI watch CBS, and I see BS\nTrying to track us down with GPS\nMake a nigga want to invest in PBS (see BS)\n[Chorus]\nWatch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins\nStop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box\nAnd \nunplug from the Matrix doctrine\nBut watch what you say, Big Brother is watching\nWatch what you're watching, Fox keeps feeding us toxins\nStop sleeping, start thinking outside of the box\nAnd unplug from the Matrix doctrine\nBut watch what you say, Fox Five is watching\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill\nBut what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?\nWhat about Cheney and Halliburton?\nThe back \ndoor deals on oil fields?\nHow is Nas the most violent person?\nY'all don't know talent if it hit you\nBringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol\nI use Viacom as my firearm\nThen let the lyrics split you, who do you rely upon?\nThen shoot shells at Leviath-o-n\nI'm dealing with the higher form\nFuck if you care of how I write a poem\nOnly fox that I loved was the Red one\nOnly black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one\nRed rum, political bedlam\nDon't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum\nMurdoch owns Fox, not A-Team with Baracus\nAnd he hates Barack cause he march with the marches\n[Interlude: Deep voice]\nI pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth\nNot the biased truth\nNot the liest truth\nBut the highest truth\nI will not be deceived\nNor will I believe in the propaganda\nI will not fall for the okie-doke\nI am tuned in...\n\n[Outro]\nWatch what they watching\nWatch what you're watching\nBetter watch because they're watching\nWatch what you're watching\nM-m-media, misleading you\nWatch what you're watching"
