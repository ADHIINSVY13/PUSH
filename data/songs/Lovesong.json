  "lyrics": "On “Lovesong”, Adele takes The Cure’s classic rock ballad for a sensual, bossa-nova spin. On the standard edition of 21, it’s the penultimate track; on others (like the iTunes version), it’s just the tenth.\n[Verse 1]\nWhenever I'm alone with you\nYou make me feel like I am home again\nWhenever I'm alone with you\nYou make me feel like I am whole again\n[Verse 2]\nWhenever I'm alone with you\nYou make me feel like I am young again\nWhenever I'm alone with you\nYou make me feel like I am fun again\n[Chorus]\nHowever far away, I will always love you\nHowever long I stay, I will always love you\nWhatever words I say, I will always love you\nI will always love you\n[Verse 3]\nWhenever I'm alone with you\nYou make me feel like I am free again\nWhenever I'm alone with you\nYou make me feel like I am clean again\n[Chorus]\nHowever far away, I will always love you\nHowever long I stay, I will always love you\nWhatever words I say, I will always love you\nI will always love you\nHowever far away, I will always love you\nHowever long I stay, I will always love you\nWhatever words I say, I will always love you\nI'll always love you\n\n[Outro]\nI'll always love you\n'Cause I love you\nLove, love"
