  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Syreeta]\nThe strangest thought came to me on this morning\nAs I awoke to greet the coming dawn\nThe sun was hardly peaking through the garden\nIt felt that with everything, I was one\n[Chorus: Syreeta]\nThen I wished that I could come back\nAs a flower, as a flower, as a flower\nHow I wished that I could come back\nAs a flower, as a flower\nTo spread the sweetness of love\nTo spread the sweetness of love\n[Verse 2: Syreeta]\nThe dew had finished making love to many\nA rainbow smelling sweet was in the air\nI envied all the silence I saw growing\nSo unmoved by things outside of themselves\n[Chorus: Syreeta, Stevie Wonder]\nAnd how I wished that I could come back\nAs a flower, as a flower, as a flower\nHow I wished that I could come back\nAs a flower, as a flower\nTo spread the sweetness of love\n\n[Chorus: Syreeta, Stevie Wonder]\nHow I wished that I could come back\nAs a flower, oh, as a flower, as a flower\nHow I wished that I could come back\nAs a flower, as a flower\nTo spread the sweetness of love\nTo spread the sweetness of love\n[Instrumental Outro]"
