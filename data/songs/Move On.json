Lyrically, the song tells about a person who cannot forgot the memories they had made with their ex.\n[Intro]\nWohooo Whoooo\n[Verse 1]\nHow do I end up in the same old place\nFaced again with the same mistakes\nSo stubborn thinking I know what is right\nBut life proves me wrong every time\nTaking roads that lead me nowhere\nHow do I expect to get there\nBut when, oh when will I learn to just put you first\n[Chorus]\nI come to you now when I need you\nBut why do I wait to come see you\nI always try to do this on my own\nBut I was wrong cause only with you can I move on\nCan I move on\nOh\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I am weak it's you that makes me strong\nAnd I know that you've been with me all along\nSo many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart\nWith you life is so easy why do I make it hard\nOh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I\nLearn to just put you first\n\n[Chorus]\nHey!\nI come to you now when I need you\nBut why do I wait to come see you\nI always try to do this on my own\nBut I was wrong cause only with you can I move on\n[Verse 3]\nI get out of my own way, let you have your way\nCause I realize I'm no good on my own\nI'm there for you, I'll serve for you\nI can't live without you. No\n[Chorus]\nI come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you\nI always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong\nWith only you, only you, with only you\nCan I move on, can I move on, can I move on"
