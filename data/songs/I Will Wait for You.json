  "lyrics": "The clock will tick away the hours one by one\nAnd then the time will come when all the waiting's done\nThe time when you return and find me here and run\nIf it takes forever I will wait for you\nFor a thousand summers, I will wait for you\nTill you're back, back beside me, till I'm holding you\nTill I hear you sigh here in my arms\nAnywhere you wander, anywhere you go\nEvery day remember how I love you so\nIn your heart believe what in my heart I know\nThat forevermore I'll wait for you"
