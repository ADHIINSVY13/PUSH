  "lyrics": "This is a special version for SBTV made to comemorate their 10 years and the 7 year anniversary of Ed’s ‘You Need Me I Don’t Need You’ performance for them, that set off his career.\n[Verse 1]\nI was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind\nLearned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become\nGuess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or a Uni' degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nShowed me the locked doors, I'll find another use for key\nAnd you'll see\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\nBut with that said, give me one more, higher\n[Chorus]\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to think that nothing could be better than tourin' the world with my songs\nI chased the picture-perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're livin' your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playin' for the people, Dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearin' the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou'\nI may have grown up, but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now\nSomehow\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\n[Chorus]\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\n[Verse 3]\nI woke up this mornin' lookin' in the mirror\nThinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner\nThe industry told me to look like them\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\nI wish that she could've been my first time\nAnd I wish that I'd never took that first line\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\nBut forgive me if it doesn't\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\nI wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't\nI wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue and\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngen\nWish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party\nBut that hardly matters now, man, does it?\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\nI wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget\nBut while we're on the subject\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\nBut that's the sacrifice that we make\nSpendin' my whole time high livin' life away\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n[Verse 4]\nI wish my family and friends, they stay healthy\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\nI found myself late night wishin' on a star\nEveryday, I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh\nAnd I wish I'd never run through\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\nIf I told my fans the things I did, then they'd say, \"Fuck you\"\nI wish I was home more\nI wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour\nAnd I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more people that I love 'em\nBut it's in the music that I'm known for\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\nOh, yes, I guess it does and we're still stressing 'cause\nEvery day, the **** gets the best of us\nLosin' my balance on a razor blade\nSpendin' my whole time high, wishin' life away\n[Chorus]\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nWe got drama, but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n[Verse 5]\nI'm using jumpers for goalposts,\n \ncigarettes for throat coat\nMum's sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" though I don't listen, I got\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\nPeople that I don't know share the same vision\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine\nTryna find a love with a compatible star sign\nSometimes, I can't write, sentences can't rhyme\nStarin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryna find mine\nShit, quick, before I hit it again\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\nAnd who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\nI'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick\nMy daddy told me, \"Work hard and you can never be shit\"\nI've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\nSat back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had\nOne wish"
