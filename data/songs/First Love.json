  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSo little to say, but so much time\nDespite my empty mouth, the words are in my mind\nPlease, wear the face, the one where you smile\nBecause you lighten up my heart when I start to cry\n[Chorus]\nForgive me, first love, but I'm tired\nI need to get away to feel again\nTry to understand why\nDon't get so close to change my mind\nPlease wipe that look out of your eyes\nIt's bribing me to doubt myself\nSimply, it's tiring\n[Verse 2]\nThis love has dried up, and stayed behind\nAnd if I stay, I'll be a lie\nThen choke on words I'd always hide\nExcuse me, first love, but we're through\nI need to taste the kiss from someone new\nForgive me, first love, but I'm too tired\nI'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire\n[Outro]\nForgive me, first love, forgive me, first love\nForgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me\nForgive me, first love, forgive me, first love"
