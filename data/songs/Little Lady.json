I wanna know\"\nNo prizes for guessin' who it is, resistance would be foolishness\nYou open the front door, he boots you in\nThere's somethin' new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror\nGet your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error\nHe towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight\nAt this point, your life flashes before your eyes\nYour handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor\nDespite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye\nAnd in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece\nAnd dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street\nLittle lady left this earth in the worst way\nAll because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nAnd we're all under the upper hand\nAnd goin' mad for a couple grams\nAnd we don't wanna go outside, tonight\n'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland\nAnd sell love to another man\nIt's too cold outside\nFor angels to fly\nFor angels to fly\nAnd fly, fly\nFor angels to fly\nTo fly, to fly\nAnd angels to die"
