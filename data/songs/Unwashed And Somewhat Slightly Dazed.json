  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSpy, spy, pretty girl\nI see you see me through your window\nDon't turn your nose up\nWell, you can if you need to; you won't be the first or last\nIt must strain you\nTo look down so far from your father's house\nAnd I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you\nI'm, the cream\nOf the great Utopia dream\nAnd you're, the gleam\nIn the depths of your banker's spleen\n[Verse 1]\nI'm a Phallus in pigtails\nAnd there's blood on my nose\nAnd my tissue is rotting\nWhere the rats chew my bones\nAnd my eye socket's empty\nSee nothing but pain\nI keep havin' this brainstorm\nAbout twelve times a day\n[Chorus]\nSo now, you could spend the morning\nWalking with me, quite amazed\nAs I am unwashed, and somewhat slightly dazed\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've got eyes in my backside\nThat see electric tomatoes\nOn credit card rye bread\nThere are children in washrooms\nHolding hands with a Queen\nAnd my heads full of murders\nWhere only killers scream\n[Chorus]\nSo now you could spend your morning\nTalking with me, quite amazed\nLook out, I'm raving mad, and somewhat slightly dazed\n[Guitar & Harmonica Solos]\n[Verse 3]\nNow you run from your window\nTo the porcelain bowl\nAnd you're sick from your ears\nTo the red parquet floor\nAnd the Braque on the wall\nSlides down your front\nAnd eats through your belly\nIt's very catching (Woo!)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo now, you should spend the morning\nLying to your father, quite amazed\nAbout the strange, unwashed, and happily slightly dazed\n[\nOutro\n]\nOh, oh, yeah\nOh\nOooh!\nI'm not following!\nYeah, yeah, baby, yeah\nYeah, yeah, baby, yeah\nYeah, yeah, baby, yeah\nYeah\nDon't sit down\nDon't sit down\nDon't sit down"
