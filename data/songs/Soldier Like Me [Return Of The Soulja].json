Dee got the strap and she anxious\nHurry up 'fore she spank shit\nComin' round the corner spittin' rounds, they can't hold me down\nCaught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds\nNow tell me how that sound? A double date laced with hate\nMake 'em pray for the Judgement Day\nNow tell me how that sound? A double date laced with hate\nMake 'em pray for the Judgement Day, stinkin' bitch\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & \n2Pac\n]\nI bet you that I got something you ain't got\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\n)\nThat's called courage\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\n)\nIt don't come from no liquor bottle\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\n)\nIt ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\n)\nI don't walk around like no G\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\n)\n‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\n)\nI don't try to act like you do\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\n)\n‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?\n(\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\n)\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nIt's Tupac\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me"
