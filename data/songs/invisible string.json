  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGreen was the color of the grass\nWhere I used to read at Centennial Park\nI used to think I would meet somebody there\nTeal was the color of your shirt\nWhen you were sixteen at the yogurt shop\nYou used to work at to make a little money\n[Chorus]\nTime, curious time\nGave me no compasses, gave me no signs\nWere there clues I didn't see?\nAnd isn't it just so pretty to think\nAll along there was some\nInvisible string\nTying you to me?\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n[Verse 2]\nBad was the blood of the song in the cab\nOn your first trip to LA\nYou ate at my favorite spot for dinner\nBold was the waitress on our three-year trip\nGetting lunch down by the Lakes\nShe said I looked like an American singer\n\n[Chorus]\nTime, mystical time\nCutting me open, then healing me fine\nWere there clues I didn't see?\nAnd isn't it just so pretty to think\nAll along there was some\nInvisible string\nTying you to me?\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n[Bridge]\nA string that pulled me\nOut of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar\nSomething wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire\nChains around my demons\nWool to brave the seasons\nOne single thread of gold\nTied me to you\n[Verse 3]\nCold was the steel of my axe to grind\nFor the boys who broke my heart\nNow I send their babies presents\nGold was the color of the leaves\nWhen I showed you around Centennial Park\nHell was the journey, but it brought me heaven\n\n[Chorus]\nTime, wondrous time\nGave me the blues and then purple-pink skies\nAnd it's cool, baby, with me\nAnd isn't it just so pretty to think\nAll along there was some\nInvisible string\nTying you to me?\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nMe\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n[Outro]\n(Ah-ah-ah)\n(Ah-ah-ah)"
