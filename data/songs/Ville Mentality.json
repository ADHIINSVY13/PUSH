And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—\nAnd she say, \"clean up\"—I say—\n[Bridge]\nNigga play me, never, give up my chain, never\nGive up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never\nDirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never\nDirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never\nNigga play me, never, give up my chain, never\nGive up my pride, never, show 'em my pain, never\nDirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never\nDirt on my name, never, dirt on my name, never\n[Chorus]\nHow long can I survive with this mentality?\nHow long can I survive with this mentality?\nThings fall down, but don’t stop now\nOh, can’t stop now\nOh, won’t stop now\n[Outro]\nI get mad and I slam my door and go in my room—\nAnd then, I get mad and I say, \"I wish my dad was here\""
