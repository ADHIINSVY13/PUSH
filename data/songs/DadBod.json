Okay\nYou want to hear about my everyday\nI wake up, I wake my son up, then I feed him\nAnd lead him into his car seat\nDrive up the street down to Target\nDon't do hard drugs or beat my wife\nBut the paparazzi still wanna start shit\nI don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch\nThen I walk through the automatic doors\nA couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour\nI ain't trying to ignore her\nBut I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck\nAnd I need some new drawers\nThen I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (\nCan I have a picture?\n)\nAsking for a pic and I say sure\nScratch my dick and shake his hand\nShaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man\nNow I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels\nI also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels\nA really hot girl walks by with a fat ass\nBut I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash\nForgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash\nThen I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass\nHead to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal\nIs this want you wanted, everyday life material?\nI'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring\nMade it out the basement, now my bank account soaring\nMost exciting part of my life is probably touring\nDon't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city\nBut hotels suck and the internet is shitty\nI mean, why rap about everyday shit\nWhen I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this?\n\n[Chorus]\nChillin' with the homies at the crib\nBumpin' Pac Div, this the life I live, you ain't know about it\nHit the studio with No I.D.​\nMake a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it\nOn the 101, my wife text me\nTalkin' 'bout, \"You gotta get home, feed your son,\" girl, don't trip about it\nWalk up in with apple sauce and broccoli\nLittle Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it\n[Outro]\nHello, no one is available to take your call\nPlease leave a message after the tone\nBro, call me back\nWe couldn't get the fuckin' Super **** sample cleared again, so fuckin' annoying, bro\nBut honestly, I just say that we chop up the Toro y Moi joint\nThat we were gonna put on \nUltra 85\nAnd just like flip, fuckin' freak the shit outta that joint\nI think it could be crazy\nCall me back, I'ma chop it up on the MPC\nHere I go"
