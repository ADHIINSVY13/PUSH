  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStaring all alone and your grace and style\nCut me to the bone with your razor blade smile\nI watched you playing pool\nIt's all around the school that I love you\nI love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes\nAlways unprepared for your pointed replies\nCynical and lean\nI lie awake and dream about you\n[Chorus]\nIf you only knew what I'm going through\nTime and again I get ashamed to say your name\nIt's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there\nMy lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away\n[Verse 2]\nSitting in my room, I've got it bad\nCrying for the moon, they think I'm mad\nThey say it isn't real but I know what I feel and I love you\n[Chorus]\nIf you only knew what I'm going through\nTime and again I get ashamed to say your name\nIt's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there\nMy lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away\n\n[Outro]\nSitting in my room, I've got it bad\nCrying for the moon, they think I'm mad\nBut I would give my life for a single night beside you"
