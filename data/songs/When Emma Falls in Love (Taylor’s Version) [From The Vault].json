  "artist": "Taylor Swift",
  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen Emma falls in love, she paces the floor\nCloses the blinds and locks the door\nWhen Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom\nJokes about the ways that this one could go wrong\nShe waits and takes her time\n'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain\nWhen Emma falls in love, I know\nThat boy will never be the same\n[Chorus]\n'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down\nLike if Cleopatra grew up in a small town\nAnd all the bad boys would be good boys\nIf they only had a chance to love her\nAnd to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her\n[Verse 2]\nWhen Emma falls in love, it's all on her face\nHangs in the air like stars in outer space\nWhen Emma falls in love, she disappears\nAnd we all just laugh after seein' it all these years\nWhen Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone\nShe takes on the pain and bears it on her own\n'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps\nShe won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she's the kind of book that you can't put down\nLike if Cleopatra grew up in a small town\nAnd all the bad boys would be good boys\nIf they only had a chance to love her\nAnd to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her\n[Bridge]\nWell, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​\nShe won't lose herself in love the way that I did\n'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place\nWhen Emma falls in love, I'm learning\n[Verse 3]\nEmma met a boy with eyes like a man\nTurns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand\nNow he'll be her shelter when it rains\nLittle does he know, his whole world's about to change\n[Chorus]\n'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down\nLike if Cleopatra grew up in a small town\nAnd all the bad boys would be good boys\nIf they only had a chance to love her\nAnd to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her"
