  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\n\"I'll catch the tram line in the morning\nWith your leave\", Van Bushell said\nHe had further heard the cock crow\nAs he stumbled out the shed\nThen blind Joseph came towards him\nWith a shotgun in his arms\nHe said, \"You'll pay me twenty dollars\nBefore you leave my farm\"\nVan Bushell saw a hook\nWhich replaced Joseph's hand\nHe said, \"Now calm you down, my brother\nLet's discuss this man to man\"\nIt's no good you getting angry\nWe must try to act our age\nYou're pursuing your convictions\nLike some hermit in a cage\n[Chorus]\nYou're the son of your father\nYou try a little bit harder\nDo for me as he would do for you\nWith blood and water, bricks and mortar\nHe built for you a home\nYou're the son of your father\nSo treat me as your own\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, slowly Joseph barely lowered the rifle\nAnd he emptied out the shells\nVan Bushell, he came towards him\nHe shook his arm and wished him well\nHe said, \"Now, hey, blind man, that is fine\nBut I sure can't waste my time\nSo move aside and let me go my way\nI've got a train to ride\"\nWell, Joseph turned around\nHis grin was now a frown\nHe said, \"Let me just refresh your mind\nYour manners, boy, seem hard to find\"\n[Chorus]\nYou're the son of your father\nYou try a little bit harder\nDo for me as he would do for you\nWith blood and water, bricks and mortar\nHe built for you a home\nYou're the son of your father\nSo treat me as your own\n[Verse 3]\nWell there's two men lying dead as nails\nOn an East Virginia farm\nFor charity's an argument\nThat only leads to harm\nSo be careful when they're kind to you\nDon't you end up in the dirt\nJust remember what I'm saying to you\nAnd you likely won't get hurt\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the son of your father\nOh, try a little bit harder\nYou gotta do for me as he would do for you\nWith blood and water, bricks and mortar\nHe built for you a home\nYou're the son of your father\nSo treat me as your own\n[Outro]\nYou're the son of your father\nSo treat me as your own\nYou're the son of your father\nSo treat me as your own, yeah"
