And at no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, \"I'll shoot you\" or, \"I'm going to shoot\" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. And we looked at him and he was shot and there was blood coming from him, and we took off running—\n[Bridge]\nAre we all alone\nFighting on our own?\nPlease give me a chance\nI don't wanna dance\nSomething's got me down\nI will stand my ground\nDon't just stand around\nDon't just stand around\n[Interlude 2: Dorian Johnson:]\nAs we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, 'cause I was fearing for my life, and I hid by the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running 'cause he feared for me, too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend—his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired seven more shots and my friend died\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd all we wan' do is take the chains off\nAll we wan' do is break the chains off and\nAll we wan' do is be free\nAll we wan' do is be free\nAll we wan' do is take the chains off\nAll we wan' do is break the chains off and\nAll we wan' do is be free\nAll we wan' do is be free"
