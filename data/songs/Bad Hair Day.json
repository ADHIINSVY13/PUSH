  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Olivia Rodrigo]\nWhen you woke up this mornin' and you saw your hair was fried\nYou washed it, combed it, curled it, but it still looked like Einstein\nYou tried to show your head who's boss\nYou tried to have your way\nBut there was voodoo in your hairdo\n[Chorus: Madison Hu, \nwith Olivia Rodrigo\n]\nIt's gonna be a bad hair day\nBad hair day\n[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo]\nYou warned the kids at school that they should run right out of sight\n'Cause your bad hair was angry and was lookin' for a fight\nIt stole a watch, it stole some cash, and this kid's fish filet\nThen you saw the flashin' sirens\n[Chorus: Madison Hu, \nwith Olivia Rodrigo\n]\nI'm havin' a bad hair day\nBad hair day, bad hair, bad hair\nPushed a cop down the stairs\nThey locked your hair away\nHey, do I get a phone call?\nIt's been a bad hair day, bad hair day\n[Verse 3: Olivia Rodrigo]\nYour hair got sent to trial but your lawyer didn't care\nThe judge made his decision, he said, \"Sеnd her to the chair\"\nTime to clip thosе outlaw strands and finally make 'em pay\n'Cause, today, there's no escaping\n\n[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo & Madison Hu]\nA bad hair day, bad hair, bad hair\nChange of heart, sayin' prayers\nIt might sound quite cliché\nBut it's the legend of the bad hair day"
