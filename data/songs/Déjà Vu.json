Where am I?\nMan, fuck, am I hungover, and goddamn, I\nGot a headache, shit, half a Vicodin, why can't I?\nAll systems ready for take off, please stand by\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know\nFeels like I been down this road before\nSo lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me\nAs soon as I go home and close the door\nKinda feels like déjà vu\nI wanna get away from this place, I do\nBut I can't and I won't,\n \nsay I try, but I know that's a lie\n'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nSo I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then\n (Ahhh!)\nCouple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high\nNow I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by\nWouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die\nOh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use\nThere's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through\nIt's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze\nWhat else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?\nNow here I am three months later, full-blown relapse\n\"Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax\"\nAnd since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac\nI need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps\nJust to be able to function throughout the day, let's see\nThat's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?\nAnd that will average out to about one good hour's sleep\nOkay, so now ya see the reason how come he\nHas taken four years to just put out an album, B\nSee, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath\n'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?\nIt was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?\nOr the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?\nYour VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR\nGreat places to hide 'em, ain't it?\n \nSo you can lie to Hailie\nI'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina!\nGo in the room and shut the bedroom door\nAnd wake up in an ambulance, they said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know\nFeels like I been down this road before\nSo lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me\nAs soon as I go home and close the door\nKinda feels like déjà vu\nI wanna get away from this place, I do\nBut I can't and I won't,\n \nsay I try, but I know that's a lie\n'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know"
