  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust\nFilming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above\n[Chorus]\nGot the music in you, baby, tell me why\nGot the music in you, baby, tell me why\nYou've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye\n[Verse 2]\nKisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms\nYou've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark\n[Chorus]\nGot the music in you, baby, tell me why\nGot the music in you, baby, tell me why\nYou've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye\n[Bridge]\nYour lips, my lips\nApocalypse\nYour lips, my lips\nApocalypse\nGo and sneak us through the rivers\nFlood is rising up on your knees\nOh, please\nCome out and haunt me, I know you want me\nCome out and haunt me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids\nSleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist\n[Chorus]\nGot the music in you, baby, tell me why\nGot the music in you, baby, tell me why\nYou've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye\nYou've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye\n[Outro]\nOh, when you're all alone\nI will reach for you\nWhen you're feeling low\nI will be there too"
