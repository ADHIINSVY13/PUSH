  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStone love, she kneels before the grave\nA brave son who gave his life to save the slogan\nThat hovers between the headstone and her eyes\nFor they penetrate her grieving\n[Verse 2]\nNew love, a boy and girl are talking\nNew words that only they can share in\nNew words, a love so strong it tears their hearts to sleep\nThrough the fleeting hours of morning\n[Chorus]\nLove is careless in its choosing\nSweeping over \ncross and baby\nLove descends on those defenseless\nIdiot love will spark the fusion\nInspirations have I none\nJust to touch the flaming dove\nAll I have is my love of love\nAnd love is not loving\n[Solo]\n[Verse 3]\nSoul love, the priest that tastes the word and\nTold of love and how my God on high is\nAll love,\n \nthough reaching up, my loneliness evolves\nBy the blindness that surrounds him\n\n[Chorus]\nLove is careless in its choosing\nSweeping over cross and baby\nLove descends on those defenseless\nIdiot love will spark the fusion\nInspirations have I none\nJust to touch the flaming dove\nAll I have is my love of love\nAnd love is not loving\n[Outro]\n(Love, love, love)\n(Soul love, soul love)"
