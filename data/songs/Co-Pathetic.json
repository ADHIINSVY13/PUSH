  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was stepping up with full intent to be incredible\nSo indebted, so unmeasured\nColour-right my face, it feels prophetic coming in second place\nCome and get it, I am everything\n[Verse 2]\nI went step-by-step to my own death, it's all ephemeral\nLet me at it, let me manage\nDon't remind me, babe, I feel paretic trying to celebrate\nCo-pathetic, a 'coat-on' panic\n[Chorus]\nYou better get some balance, you better find a way\nYou better get somebody to be your always\nYou better get some balance, you better find a way\nYou better get somebody to be your always\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nYou better get some balance, you better find a way\nYou better get somebody to be your always\nYou better get some balance, you better find a way\nYou better get somebody"
