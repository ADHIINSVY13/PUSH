  "lyrics": "You don't know, you don't know\nYou don't know what love is\nYou don't know what love is\nUntil you've learned the meaning of the blues\nUntil you've lost a love, you had to lose\nYou don't know what love is\nYou don't know how lips hurts\nUntil you've kissed and had to pay the cost\nUntil you've flipped your heart and you have lost\nOh, you don't know what love is\nDo you know how a lost heart fears\nThe thought of reminiscing\nAnd how lips that taste of tears\nThey lose their taste for kissing\nYou don't know how hearts burn\nFor love that cannot live yet never dies\nUntil you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes\nOh, you don't know what love is\nOh, you don't know, you don't know what love is\nOh, you don't know\n\nDo you know how a lost heart fears\nThe thought of reminiscing\nAnd how lips that taste of tears\nThey lose their taste for kissing\nYou don't know how hearts burn\nFor love that cannot live yet never dies\nUntil you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes\nOh no, you don't know what love is\nYou don't know what love is\nYou don't know, you don't know what love is\nOh, you don't know, oh you don't know\nYou don't know, you don't know what love is\nOh, you don't know, you don't know\nOh, you don't know, I say you don't know"
