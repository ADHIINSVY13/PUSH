But\n[Pre-Chorus]\nChange is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings\nTryin' to find the power in me to be faithful\nChange is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me\nMaybe by the time summer's done\nI'll be able to be honest, capable\nOf holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall\nWhen I don't feel beautiful or stable\nMaybe it's enough to just be where we are because\n[Chorus]\nEvery time that we run, we don't know what it's from\nNow we finally slow down, we feel close to it\nThere's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when\nBut whenever it does, we'll be here for it\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in\nIt's comin' in softly on the wings of a song\nThere's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour\nIt's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood\n[Refrain]\nLately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care\nWho am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?\nI've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care\n'Cause who am I to wanna try? But\n[Pre-Chorus]\nChange is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings\nTryin' to find the power in me to be faithful\nChange is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me\nMaybe by the time summer's done\nI'll be able to be honest, capable\nOf holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall\nWhen I don't feel beautiful or stable\nMaybe it's enough to just be where we are, because\n[Chorus]\nEvery time that we run, we don't know what it's from\nNow we finally slow down, we feel close to it\nThere's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when\nBut whenever it does, we'll be here for it\n\n[Outro]\nMmm\nYeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it\nMmm\nWhenever it does, we'll be here for it"
