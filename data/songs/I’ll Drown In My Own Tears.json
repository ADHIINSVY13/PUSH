  "lyrics": "It brings a tear into my eyes\nWhen I begin to realize\nI've cried so much since you've been gone\nI guess I'll drown in my own tears\nI've been crying just like a child\nMy pouring tears are running wild\nIf you don't think you'll be home soon\nI guess I'll drown, oh yeah, in my own tears\nI know it's true\nInto each life\nOh, some rain, rain must pour\nI'm so blue\nHere without you\nIt keeps raining more and more\nWhy don't you come home so I won't be all alone\nIf you don't think you'll be home soon\nI Guess I'll (drown in my own tears\nOh, don't let me (drown in my own tears)\nWhen I'm in trouble, baby (drown in my own tears)\nOh, don't let me (drown in my own tears)\nI guess I'll drown in my own tears"
