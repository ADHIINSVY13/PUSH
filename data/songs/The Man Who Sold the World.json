  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe passed upon the stair\nWe spoke of was and when\nAlthough I wasn't there\nHe said I was his friend\nWhich came as some surprise\nI spoke into his eyes\n\"I thought you died alone\nA long, long time ago\"\n[Chorus]\nOh no, not me\nI never lost control\nYou're face to face\nWith the man who sold the world\n[Verse 2]\nI laughed and shook his hand\nAnd made my way back home\nI searched for form and land\nFor years and years, I roamed\nI gazed a gazely stare\nAt all the millions here\nWe must have died alone\nA long, long time ago\n\n[Chorus]\nWho knows? Not me\nWe never lost control\nYou're face to face\nWith the man who sold the world\nWho knows? Not me\nWe never lost control\nYou're face to face\nWith the man who sold the world"
