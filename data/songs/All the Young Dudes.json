Rex\nHey, brother, you guessed\nI'm a dude\n[Chorus]\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\n[Verse 2]\nNow Lizzy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen\nHe can kick like a mule\nIt's a real mean team\nWe can love\nWe can love\nAnd my brother's back at home\nWith his \nBeatles and his Stones\nWe never got it off on that revolution stuff\nWhat a drag\nToo many snags\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWell, I drunk a lot of wine\nAnd I'm feeling fine\nGonna race some cat to bed\nIs this concrete all around\nOr is it in my head?\nOh, brother, you guessed\nI'm a dude\n[Chorus]\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news\nAll the young dudes\nCarry the news\nBoogaloo dudes\nCarry the news"
