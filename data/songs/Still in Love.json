  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGoing to tell you a story\n'Bout a love and all its glory\nEvery word I say is true\nEvery word is meant for you\nAs I look across the table\nIn your eyes I see forever\nGirl, there's no one else but you\nNo one else will ever do\n[Chorus]\nI'm, I'm\nI'm still in love with you\n[Verse 2]\nGot my heart so full of laughter\nI finally found what I was after\nCaught an angel flying low\nNow there's one thing you should know\nI've been lost and I've been lonely\n'Til I found you, one and only\nYou're every song I want to sing\nMy joy, my everything\n[Chorus]\nI'm, I'm, I'm, I'm\nI'm still in love with you\n\n[Bridge]\nI want you to know just how I feel\nNow that my search for love is over\nIt would be a lonely life without you\n[Verse 3]\nAs the years keep getting longer\nIt only makes my love grow stronger\nI just can't go another day\nUntil I can hear you say\n[Chorus]\nI'm, I'm, I'm, I'm\nI'm still in love with you"
