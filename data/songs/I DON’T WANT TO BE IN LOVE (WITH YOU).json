  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBaby, where your head at?\nPlaying games with a player, where your sense at?\nWould you leave and not come back if I took my bread back?\nCould you make sense of it all?\nWould you be able to pick me up and dust me off when I fall?\nAre you ready for all of that I am?\nThe suffering, struggling of a real man\nWould you offer me your hand?\nWould you take back everything that you said?\nWhen you was laying in bed?\nWhen you was fucking and giving me head?\nI left all my bitches on read for you\nI never took them hoes off of the bench\n[Interlude]\n(\nToasty\n)\nYeah\n[Chorus]\nI know I don't want to be in love (With you, with you)\nYeah\nI know I don't want to be in love (With you)\n[Verse 2]\nI put this bitch in a Benz\nNone of my friends understood what we had, yuh\nLost everything that we could have been now\nKnee deep in sorrow, no hope for tomorrow\nI feel like the reaper is taking me out\nLook around, see everybody in doubt about us\nWaiting for us to combust, lose all the love that we had\nBroken the trust, shotgun in my trunk\nI might just blow myself to dust\nI might just give up and give it all back\nI might just close my eyes and fade to black\nI might just paint the Cadillac\nI might forgive you and live with the pain\nDon't never forget, the feeling's intact\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I don't want to be in love (With you, with you)\nI know I don't want to be in love (With you, with you)"
