Me or the money, what you loyal to?\nHuh, I gave you my loyalty\nMade you royalty and royalties\nTook care of these niggas' lawyer fees\nAnd this is how niggas rewarded me, damn\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]\nOoh, I love you so\nBut why I love you, I'll never know\nOoh, I love you so\nBut why I love you, I'll never know\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z & \nKanye West\n]\nBussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me\nBut I'm bulletproof, bitch, you can't get nothin' past me\nGot body armor\nA nigga gotta watch the throne\nAnd I'm bussin' back\nSo niggas in a glass house should not throw stones\nWhat do you do when the love turn to hate?\nGotta separate from these fuckin' fakes\nCaesar didn't see it, so he ceased to exist\nSo the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit\nAm I my brother's keeper?\nOnly if that nigga don't creep up\nGot a pistol under my pillow\nI've never been a deep sleeper\nP-P-P-Paranoia, \n'cause the nigga that said he'll\nBlast for ya \nis now\n blastin' for ya\nThat's an assassin for ya\nThese niggas got a shot, they'll shoot\nPlease Lord, \nforgive him\nFor these niggas \nnot know\n what they do, ooh"
