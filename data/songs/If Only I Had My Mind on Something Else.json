  "lyrics": "I could be king of kings, wear a crown and all the things\nI'd want I'd never need\nI'd be an ace in an aeroplane\nAnd every year, I'd fly to Spain\nIf I could get the nerve to plant the seed\nOh, help me how to say goodbye\nI see her face in myself\nWhy, tell me why I made her cry\nIf only had my mind on something else\nCaptain of the submarine\nBeneath the icebergs never seen\nA hero with a medal for everyday\nI find me fame, reach the top\nI keep on pushing never stop\nIf I could just forget her name\nOh, help me how to say goodbye\nI see her face in myself\nWhy, tell me why I made her cry\nIf only had my mind on something else\nIf only had my mind on something else"
