  "lyrics": "Stormy nights, I've been waiting\nSatisfy you, oh yeah\nBut his love is just a game\nAnd he's sellng you the same old lies\nAnd I'm hangin' on the wire\nAnd no closer to the fire\nAnd you don't hear me when I cry\nYou may need someone to lean upon\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nAnd what is left is a love so strong\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nYou wouldn't believe to what extent\nMy mind is going to\nYou wouldn't deny me in your dreams\nYou couldn't belong to someone else\nIf you could see me now\nAnd I'd be the only one\nWhen he's gone\nMy understanding that you remember\nFor whom the bell tolls\n, oh yeah\nI swear to you I pray\nThat you feel the battle rage\nFor the saving of my soul\n\nAnd it's a struggle to survive\nYou know it's keepin' us alive\nAnd baby I don't wanna die\nI will be someone you lean upon\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nAnd what is left is a love so strong\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nYou wouldn't believe to what extent\nMy mind is going to\nYou wouldn't deny me in your dreams\nYou couldn't belong to someone else\nIf you could see me now\nAnd I'd be the only one\nWhen he's gone\nI will be someone you lean upon\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nAnd what is left is a love so strong\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nI will be someone you lean upon\nWhen he's gone, when he's gone\nDon't tell me it's too late\nAnd your love don't make me wait\nI can see the end of time\nWith a love that makes you mine\nAnd tonight I let you know\nThere's a love that won't let go"
