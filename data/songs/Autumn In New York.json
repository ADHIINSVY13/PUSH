  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAutumn in New York\nWhy does it seem so inviting\nAutumn in New York\nIt spells the thrill of first-knighting\nGlittering crowds and shimmering clouds\nIn canyons of steel\nThey're making me feel\nI'm home\n[Verse 2]\nIt's autumn in New York\nThat brings the promise of new love\nAutumn in New York\nIs often mingled with pain\nDreamers with empty hands\nThey sigh for exotic lands\nIt's autumn in New York\nIt's good to live it again\nThis autumn in New York\nTransforms the slums into Mayfair\nAutumn in New York\nYou'll need no castles in Spain\nLovers that bless the dark\nOn benches in Central Park\n\nIt's autumn in New York\nIt's good to live it again"
