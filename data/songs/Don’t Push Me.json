Lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge, so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head, so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\nRight now I'm on the edge, so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head, so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]\nI done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry\nToo young to understand the consequences of a man living a lie\nI gotta get that money\n, I'll be damned if I'm bummy\nGotta watch my back around these niggas 'cause they funny\nTwenty years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded\nSmoking that bong 'cause I need it\nThese niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried\nBogged in the dirt from shots flurried\nLaying with bugs under my shirt\nI got plans to hop up in that Hummer, 'cause I'm a stunner\nI sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number\nUnder my chest is a heart of a lion, I ain't lyin'\nBounty hunters got me flying with my iron, high as a giant\nI'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching\nTo give you more than a concussion, end of discussion\nMy blood is colder so I'm bolder, Hennessy and soda\nHood on my shoulder, \nlook in the mirror, I see a soldier\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & \nEminem\n]\nRight now I'm on the edge, so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head, so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\nRight now I'm on the edge, so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head, so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n (\nEm, drop that shit, c'mon\n)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThese are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears\nThis is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears\n (What else?)\nThis is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV\nWhat you hear on CD, what appears easy (What else?)\nMan these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers\nIn these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (C'mon)\nLike it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang\nAnd you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing\nAin't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying\nI bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing\nMan, I'm done saying that I'm done playing\nI'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers\n (C'mon)\nThere's no way I'ma back down like a goddamn coward, I can't\nHow would I look as a man bowing to his knees?\nLike the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me\nAnd not lash back out at 'em, please\nOh, woah, yo, ho\nHold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall\nYou wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial\nI try to show you art, but you just pick it apart\nSo I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts\nA whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you (C'mon)\nSo you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow\nLittle soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge, so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head, so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\nRight now I'm on the edge, so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head, so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n[Outro: Tony Yayo]\nShady, Aftermath, nigga,\n \nG-Unit\nRap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over"
