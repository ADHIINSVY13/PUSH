You suck my blood like a leech\nYou break the law and you breach\nScrew my brain till it hurts\nYou've taken all my money and you want more\nMisguided old mule\nWith your pigheaded rules\nWith your narrow-minded cronies\nWho are fools of the first division\n[Chorus]\nDeath on two legs\nYou're tearing me apart\nDeath on two legs\nYou never had a heart of your own\nKilljoy, bad guy\nBig talking small fry\nYou're just an old barrow boy\nHave you found a new toy to replace me?\nCan you face me?\nBut now you can kiss my ass goodbye\nFeel good? Are you satisfied?\nDo you feel like suicide? (I think you should)\nIs your conscience all right?\nDoes it plague you at night?\nDo you feel good? (Feel good!)\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 2]\n(Ah!) Talk like a big business tycoon\nYou're just a hot air balloon\nSo no one gives you a damn\nYou're just an overgrown schoolboy\nLet me tan your hide\nDog with disease\nYou're the king of the sleaze\nPut your money where your mouth is\nMr. Know-All, was the fin on your back part of the deal?\nShark!\n[Chorus]\nDeath on two legs\nTearing me apart\nDeath on two legs\nYou never had a heart (You never did)\nOf your own (Right from the start)\nInsane, should be put inside\nYou're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride\nShould be made unemployed\nMake yourself null and void\nMake me feel good (I feel good!)"
