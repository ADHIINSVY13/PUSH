  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThey say sing what you know\nBut I've sung what they want\nSome folks do what they're told\nBut baby this time I won't\nWhen I look through that door\nI know the truth from lie\nSome things I've done before I can't justify\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere are kings in my past\nThings no one can be proud of\nBut I stand in the light I've cast\nAnd turn away from any lack of love\nOh, when I walked through that door\nI say here I go\nYou see me and nothing more\nI'm singing what I know\n[Chorus]\nI know better\nI know better\n[Verse 2]\nLegend is just a name\nI know better than to be so proud\nI won't drink in all this fame\nI'll take more love than I'm allowed\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI won't hide or cut it off from where it came\nMy history has brought me to this place\nThis power and the color of my face\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know better\nOh, I know better\n[Bridge]\nOh, I'll rise from the floor if I don't win\nI'll bust open that door so let me in\nAnd if music chooses me to sing I let her\nI'll sing what I know, yes\n[Chorus]\nI know better, oh\nI know better, yes\nI know better\nI know better"
