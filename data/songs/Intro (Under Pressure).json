Who cares?\nOne, two...\n[Verse]\nI just wanna make these music lovers remember again\nWhile the haters fall back like September again\nI was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again\nDrop the politics and bring us together again\nMaybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then\nMaybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, \nyeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nBut I'm not defined by the sales of my first week\n'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak\nAs I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces\nCompiled of different races, gathering from different places\nI just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate\nAnd even though it gets hard I know my fate\nWith my train of thought racing like a runaway freight\nLiving life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'ma get up today\nI don’t know how but I'ma find a way\nLooking for the sun in a world of gray\nFeeling like my dream is a world away\nI'ma get up today\nI don’t know how but I'ma find a way\nSearching for the sun in a world of gray\nFeeling like my dream is a world away\nWhat it feel like?\nI used to wonder what it feel like\nYeah, used to wonder what it\n\n[Chorus]\nI used to wonder what it feel like\nBut now, I know, achieved the goal\nI ran the race, I won the gold\nI used to wonder what it feel like\nBut now, I know, achieved the goal\nI ran the race, I won the gold\nI used to wonder what it feel like\nBut now, I know, achieved the goal\nI ran the race, I won the gold\nI used to wonder what it feel like\nBut now, I know, achieved the goal\nI ran the race, I won the gold\nI used to wonder what it feel like\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou can really do anything\nYou can really do anything\nYou can really do anything\nYou can really do anything\n[Outro: Thalia]\nHello.
