  "lyrics": "This track from Muse’s 4th studio album, Black Holes and Revelations, features Spanish guitar and a trumpet solo.\n\nThe song’s subject matter addresses the walls and fortresses people build around themselves.\n[Verse 1]\nStay away from me\nBuild a fortress and shield your beliefs\nTouch the divine\nAs we fall in line\n[Verse 2]\nCan I believe when I don't trust?\nAll your theories turn to dust\nI choose to hide\nFrom the All-Seeing Eye\n[Chorus]\nDestroy this city of delusion\nAnd break these walls down\nAnd I will avenge\nAnd justify my reasons with your blood\n[Verse 3]\nYou will not rest or settle for less\nUntil you guzzle and squander what's left\nDo not deny\nThat you live and let die\n[Chorus]\nDestroy this city of delusion\nAnd break these walls down\nAnd I will avenge\nAnd justify my reasons with your blood\n\n[Trumpet Solo]\n[Chorus]\nDestroy this city of delusion\nAnd break these walls down\nAnd I will avenge\nAnd justify my reasons with your blood"
