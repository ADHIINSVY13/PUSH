  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLong were the nights when\nMy days once revolved around you\nCounting my footsteps\nPraying the floor won't fall through again\nAnd my mother accused me of losing my mind\nBut I swore I was fine\nYou paint me a blue sky\nThen go back and turn it to rain\nAnd I lived in your chess game\nBut you changed the rules everyday\nWondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight\nWell, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why\n[Chorus]\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\nI should've known\n[Verse 2]\nWell, maybe it's me\nAnd my blind optimism to blame\nOr maybe it's you and your sick need\nTo give love and take it away\nAnd you'll add my name to your long list of traitors\nWho don't understand\nAnd I look back in regret how I ignored when they said\n\"Run as fast as you can\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\nDear John, I see it all now, it was wrong\nDon't you think nineteen's too young\nTo be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?\nI should've known\n[Bridge]\nYou are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\nAll the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes\n'Cause you burned them out\nBut I took your matches before fire could catch me\nSo don't look now\nI'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town\nOh, oh\n[Chorus]\nDear John, I see it all now that you're gone\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress cried the whole way home\nI see it all now that you're gone\nDon't you think I was too young to be messed with?\nThe girl in the dress wrote you a song\nYou should've known\n\n[Outro]\nYou should've known\nDon't you think I was too young?\nYou should've known"
