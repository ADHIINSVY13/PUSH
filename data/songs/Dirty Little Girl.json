  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck\nI've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck\nThat ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard\nBut I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard\nWhen I watch the police come by and move you on\nWell, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become\nWell, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear\nBut all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI should tell (I should tell)\nI should tell (I should tell)\nI should tell (I should tell)\nOh! (oh!)\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl\nSomeone grab that bitch by the ears\nRub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out\n'Cause I bet she, I bet she\nI bet she, oh, \nI bet she hasn't had a bath in a year\n[Verse 2]\nHere's my own belief about all the dirty girls\nThat you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl\nAnd like rags that belong to you I belong to myself\nSo don't show up around here till your social worker's helped\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI should tell (I should tell)\nI should tell (I should tell)\nI should tell (I should tell)\nOh! (oh!)\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl\nSomeone grab that bitch by the ears\nRub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out\n'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she, let me tell you now\nI bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year\n[Chorus]\nOh ho\nAh ho!\n'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she\nI bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year\n[Outro]\nDirty little girl (girl)\nOh ho (oh ho)\nDirty little girl (girl)\nDirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)\nDirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)\nDirty, dirty, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)\nGirl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)\nOh, oh, dirty, dirty little girl (girl)\nGirl, girl, girl, dirty, dirty little girl"
