  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wish there was another year, another time\nWhen people sang and poems rhymed\nMmm, my name could be Napoleon\n[Verse 2]\nA thousand ships, a windy sail\nSo huge and high, it's tall enough to touch the sky\nIt's beautiful, but hard to find\nBut I just wasn't born in time\n[Chorus]\nWalking back to Waterloo again\nWhere do I begin?\nIf you play indiscreet\nYou can get a good seat\nAt the end\n[Verse 3]\nI can dream of growing trees\nAnd things that live and grass that's green\nIn meadows that have never been\nBut I still place my trust in the Queen\n[Verse 4]\n(Oh, tell me)\nWhat is life when a man is pressured\nBased on wrong or right?\nAnd I don't know what it means\nThere must be more we haven't seen\n\n[Chorus]\nWalking back to Waterloo again\nWhere do I begin?\nIf you play indiscreet\nYou can get a good seat\nAt the end\n[Chorus]\nWalking back to Waterloo again\nWhere do I begin?\nIf you play indiscreet\nYou can get a good seat\nAt the end\n[Chorus]\nWalking back to Waterloo again\nWhere do I begin?\nIf you play indiscreet\nYou can get a good seat\nAt the end"
