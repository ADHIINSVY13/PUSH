  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI am a veteran of the war\nI up and joined the army back in 1964\nAt sixteen I just had to be a man at any cost\nI volunteered for Vietnam where I got my leg shot off\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI recall a quote from a movie that said \"Who's more a man\nThan a man with a reason that's worth dying for\"\n[Chorus]\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nBut now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead\n[Verse 2]\nThey gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill\nTo stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill\nThey put a gun in my hand and said, \"Shoot until he's dead\nBut it's hard to kill when 'please, I'm your friend' echoes through your head\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBrought up in church taught no man should take another's life\nBut then put in a jungle where life has no price\n\n[Chorus]\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nBut now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead\n[Bridge]\nBack in the world the paper reads today\nAnother war is in the brewing\nBut what about the lives of yesterday\nAnd the many happy families that have been ruined\n[Verse 3]\nMy niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie too\nBut they say I have no right to tell them how they should do\nThey laugh and say \"Quit bragging\" 'bout the war you should never have been in\nBut my mind is so brain-washed I'd probably go back and do it again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI walk the neighborhood parading my purple heart\nWith a fear of \nagent orange\n that no one will stop, no\n[Chorus]\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nBut now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead, yeah\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nNow I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead\nCould you believe I do?\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nThey had me standing on the front line\nBut now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to getting ahead"
