  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI look at all the things I put you through\nI've often wondered how it bothered you\nI know how close I came to losing you\nBut we managed to stay alive\nI guess only the strong survive\nI just gotta tell you, baby\n[Chorus]\nSometimes love can be so cruel\nSometimes we learn by being a fool\nI don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long?\nIt may be the water that keeps us strong\n[Verse 2]\nI took for granted that you'd always be there\nI know it seemed at times I didn't care\nI didn't know what you had given me\nBut with love it takes some time\nBut through the joy and pain you're mine\nI just gotta tell you, baby\n[Chorus]\nSometimes love can be so cruel\nSometimes we learn by being a fool\nI don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long?\nIt may be the water that keeps us strong\nIt may be the water that keeps us strong\n\n[Bridge]\nYou know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby\nThat it all turned out this way\n'Cause you know that it almost slipped away, oh baby\nBut we managed to stay alive\nI guess only the strong survive\nI just gotta tell you, baby\n[Chorus]\nSometimes love can be so cruel\nSometimes we learn by being a fool\nI don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long?\nIt may be the water that keeps us strong\n[Bridge]\nYou know that I'm so glad to say, oh baby\nThat it all turned out this way\n'Cause you know that it almost slipped away, oh baby\nBut we managed to stay alive\nI guess only the strong survive\nSo I just had to tell you, baby\n[Chorus]\nSometimes love can be so cruel\nSometimes we learn by being a fool\nI don't know why, girl, we've lasted so long?\nIt may be the water that keeps us strong\n\n[Outro]\nIt may be the water\nKeeps us strong\nIt may be the water\nKeeps us strong\nIt may be the water\nKeeps us strong"
