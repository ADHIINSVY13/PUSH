'Cause I concede\n[Chorus]\nFree me, free me\nFree me from this world\nI don't belong here\nIt was a mistake imprisoning my soul\nCan you free me, free me from this world?\n[Verse 2]\nA world lush in bloom, with rivers running wild\nThey'll be rerouted South\nWith none left for you or for me\nDon't give in \nand hear the\nEngines roar and save our crops from drought\nBut when the black gold's in doubt\nThere's none left for you or for me\nFuse Helium-3, our last hope\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd free me, and free me\nFree me from this world\nWe don't belong here\nIt was a mistake imprisoning our souls\nCan you free me, and free me from this world?\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Chorus]\nFree me, I'll free you\nFree us from this world\nWe don't belong here\nIt was a mistake imprisoning our souls\nCan you free me, and free me from this world?\n(Free me, free me)\n(Free me from this world)\n Oh, oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh\n(We don't belong here)\n(It was a mistake imprisoning our souls)\nRunning around in circles, feeling caged by endless rules\nCan you free me, and free me from this world?\n[Outro]\nAh-ah-oh, ah-ah-oh\nAh-ah-oh, oh no\nShh, go to sleep"
