(Woo)\nI keep running, oh, I keep running away\nOh does it hurt me to stay? (Woo)\nI keep running, oh, 'cause I don't wanna pay\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStars shine but start to fade in the light\nLove is blind, could be wrong or it could be right\nIn a bind telling myself it's for you\n[Chorus]\nFor you\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nFor you\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nHey, hey\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the night the devil knocks on my door\nI keep running, oh, I keep running away\nAnother life and the same thing happened before\nI keep running, oh, I keep running away\nOh and he begs me to stay (Woo)\nI keep running, oh, I keep running away\nOh will he take mе away? (Woo)\nI keep running, oh, 'cause I don't wanna pay\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStars shine but start to fade in thе light\nLove is blind, could be wrong or it could be right\nIn a bind telling myself it's for you\n[Chorus]\nFor you\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nFor you\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nFor you\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nRunning and running\nHey, hey\n\n[Outro]\n(Woo)\n(Woo)\n(Woo)"
