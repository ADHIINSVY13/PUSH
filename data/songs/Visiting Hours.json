  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wish that Heaven had visiting hours\nSo I could just show up and bring the news\nThat she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her\nThe things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you\n[Chorus]\nCan I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?\nThe little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine\nAnd soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day\nSo much has changed since you've been away\n[Verse 2]\nI wish that Heaven had visiting hours\nSo I could just swing by and ask your advice\nWhat would you do in my situation?\nI haven't a clue how I'd even raise them\nWhat would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right\n[Chorus]\nCan we just talk a while until my worries disappear\n?\nI'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure\nYou'd say, \"Remember that the answer's in the love that we create\"\nSo much has changed since you've been away\n[Verse 3]\nI wish that Heaven had visiting hours\nAnd I would ask them if I could take you home\nBut I know what they'd say, that it's for the best\nSo I will live life the way you taught me\nAnd make it on my own\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I will close the door, but I will open up my heart\nAnd everyone I love will know exactly who you are\n'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again\nSo much has changed since you've been away"
