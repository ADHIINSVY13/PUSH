Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?\nYou flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?\n\n[Chorus: Pete Rock + \nNas\n]\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\nYo, the world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\n[Bridge]\nBreak it down\nIt's yours, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nI'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed\nFor murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded\nBorn alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne\nI'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home\nI need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow\n‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow\nTryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip\nPicturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip\nAnd I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs\nHeaded for Indiana,\n \nstabbin' women like the Phantom\nThe crew is lampin' Big Willie style\nCheck the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild\nStash loot in fly clothes\n, \nburnin' dollars to light my stoge\nWalk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames,\n \nplus the games people play\nBust the problems of the world today\n\n[Chorus: Pete Rock + \nNas\n]\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n \n(\nYeah\n)\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\n[Outro: Nas & \nPete Rock\n]\n(\nBreak it down\n) \nYeah, aight\nTo everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours)\nThe world is yours\nTo everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)\nThe world is yours\nTo everybody in Brooklyn\nY'all know the world is yours (It's yours)\nThe world is yours\nEverybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours)\nLong Island, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)\nStaten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours)\nSouth Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours)\nAight"
