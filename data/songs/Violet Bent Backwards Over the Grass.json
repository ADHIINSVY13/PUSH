  "lyrics": "[Stanza 1]\nI went to a party\nI came in hot\nMade decisions beforehand\nMy mind made up\nThings that would make me happy\nTo do them or not\nEach option weighed carefully\nA plan for each thought\nAnd then I walked through the door past the open concept\nAnd saw Violet bent backwards over the grass\nSeven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand\nArched like a bridge in a fallen handstand\nGrinning wildly like a madman\nWith the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring\nWaiting for the fireworks to begin\nAnd in that moment I decided to do nothing about everything\nForever"
