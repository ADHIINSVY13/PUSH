  "lyrics": "I'm talking to all the lovers in the house tonight\nNow listen, you know I want you to find out what's wrong\nAnd get it right, or you should leave love alone\nBecause the love you save, it might be your own\nPeople, I've been misled and I've been afraid\nI've been hit in the head, ohh, and left for dead\nI've been abused, woah and I've been accused\nBeen refused a piece of bread\nBut I ain't never in my life before\nSeen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today\nI want you to stop, find out what's wrong\nGet it right or leave love alone\nBecause the love you save today\nMay very well be your own\nI've been pushed around, oh yeah, and I've been lost and found\nGiven the sundown to get out of town\nI've been taken outside, oh and I've been brutalized\nI had to always be the one to smile and apologize\nBut I ain't never in my life before\nSeen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today\n\nI want you to stop, find out what's wrong\nGet it right or leave love alone\nBecause the love you save today\nMight very well be your own"
