(Yeah)\nWas it all worth it?\nWhen the hurly burly's done\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Synth Orchestra Interlude]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe went to Bali\nSaw God and Dali\nSo mystic, surrealistic\n[Chorus]\nWas it all worth it? Yeah, yeah!\nGiving all my heart and soul\nAnd staying up all night\nWas it all worth it?\nOoh, living breathing rock 'n' roll\nThis never ending fight\nWas it all worth it?\nWas it all worth it?\n[Outro]\nYes, it was a worthwhile experience, hahahaha!\nIt was worth it!\n[Solo]\n[Synth Orchestra]"
