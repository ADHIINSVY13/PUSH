Is it winter there?\nThis winter\n[Chorus]\nMeet me in the summertime, we can move the air\nSweet Virginia countryside, I will meet you there\nBloody lips and cherry wine, moonshine in your hair\nJust keep starin' at the sun, pray for summer's end\n[Verse 2]\nCome on over, brave my storm, oceans overhead\nCome inside, my friend\nGettin' bad out there\nEvery moment we have stolen, all we had to share\nNo one wanted them\nBut you know I did, you know I did\nThis moment\n[Chorus]\nMeet me in the summertime, we can move the air\nSweet Virginia countryside, I will meet you there\nBloody lips and cherry wine, moonshine in your hair\nJust keep starin' at the sun, pray for summer's end\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nMeet me in the summertime, we can move the air\nSweet Virginia countryside, I will meet you there\nBloody lips and cherry wine, moonshine in your hair\nJust keep starin' at the sun, pray for summer's end\n[Outro]\nMeet me in the summertime\nMeet me in the summertime\nMeet me in the summertime, we can move the air\nMeet me in the summertime, I will meet you there"
