  "lyrics": "More than the greatest love the world has known\nThis is the love I give to you alone\nMore than the simple words I try to say\nI only live to love you more each day\nMore than you'll ever know, my arms long to hold you so\nMy life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping\nLonger than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you're gonna be mine\nI know I've never lived before and my heart is very sure\nNo one else could love you more\n(musical interlude)\nMore than you'll ever know , my arms they long to hold you so\nMy life will be in your keeping, waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping\nLonger than always is a long long time, but far beyond forever you'll be mine\nI know that I've never lived before and my heart is very sure\nNo one else could love you more, no one else could love you more"
