  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou tell me there's an angel in your tree\nDid he say he'd come to call on me?\nFor things are getting desperate in our home\nLiving in the parish of the restless folks I know\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEverybody now, bring your family down to the riverside\nLook to the east to see where the fat stock hide\nBehind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps\nIt's time we put the flame torch to their keep\n[Chorus]\nBurn down the mission\nIf we're gonna stay alive\nWatch the black smoke fly to heaven\nSee the red flame light the sky\nBurn down the mission\nBurn it down to stay alive\nIt's our only chance of living\nTake all you need to live inside\n[Verse 2]\nDeep in the woods the squirrels are out today\nMy wife cried when they came to take me away, yeah\nBut what more could I do just to keep her warm\nThan burn, burn, burn, burn down the mission walls?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow everybody, bring your family down to the riverside\nLook to the east to see where the fat stock hide\nBehind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps\nIt's time we put the flame torch to their keep\n[Chorus]\nBurn down the mission, Lord\nIf we're gonna stay alive\nWatch the black smoke fly to heaven\nSee the red flame light the sky\nBurn down the mission, Lord\nIf we're gonna stay alive\nIt's our only chance of living\nTake all you need to live inside"
