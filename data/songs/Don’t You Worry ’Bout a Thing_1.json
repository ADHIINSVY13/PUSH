Iraq, Iran, Eurasia, you know –\nI speak very, very, um... fluent Spanish\nUh, \ntodo 'stá bien chévere\n – you understand that?\n(\"Todo 'stá bien chévere\")\nChévere? (\nBien\n) \nChévere\nIs that right, mama?\n'Cause I got my shakin' move, I'm gonna do a little thing...\n[Verse 1]\nEverybody's got a thing\nBut some don't know how to handle it\nAlways reaching out in vain\nJust taking the things not worth having, but\n[Chorus]\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, mama\n'Cause I'll be standing on the side\nWhen you check it out\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey say your style of life's a drag\nAnd that you must go other places\nBut just don't you feel too bad\nWhen you get fooled by smiling faces\n[Chorus]\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, mama\n'Cause I'll be standing on the side\nWhen you check it out\nWhen you get off your trip\n[Bridge]\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\n[Chorus]\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, mama\n'Cause I'll be standing in the side\nWhen you check it out\nWhen you get off your trip\n[Verse 3]\nEverybody needs a change\nA chance to check out the new\nBut you're the only one to see\nThe changes you take yourself through\n\n[Chorus]\nBut don't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama\n'Cause I'll be standing in the wings\nWhen you check it out\n[Outro]\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\n(Todo 'stá bien chévere)\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\n(Todo 'stá bien chévere)\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\n(Todo 'stá bien chévere)\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nYeah\nDon't worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, mama\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, mama\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, hey\nDon't worry, don't worry, don't worry\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, sugar\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nTodo 'stá bien chévere"
