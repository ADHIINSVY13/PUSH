Why Prodigy?\nThe project politics obviously\nDemagogue democracy, in the fog I see the Mobb represented into the light\nBack to the source where all energy comes\nYour enemy, dunn, was internal\nA disease that needs a vaccination\nPlagues black seeds\nThe industry ain't as friendly as it first seems\nWhen you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys\nOn behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs\nBandana P will always stand as tall as the trees\nFirst things first, this should be understood\nQueensbridge, just ain't any other hood\nIt's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree\nI don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically\nIf it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler\nHe sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins\nMarley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing\nThe early '80s, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped\nThe beat was crazy and Marley was changing hip-hop\nThen Marley and Shant√© caught a body, UTFO\nShe cold, \"Roxanne's Revenge\", she was 14 years old\nThen came the Juice Crew\n \nand the who's whos\nG Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the Q-U\nI was probably playing with .32s in the lobby\nIt's Queensbridge over everything and everybody\nI wish the 'book never came out\nAnd everything got straightened out\nBefore you left, I saw you, it was all love\nExcept we needed to build more and get things correct\nNow I gotta accept it, 'cause there's honor in death\nWish you was here with us P\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nShout out to Havoc,\n shout out to \n'Pone\nShout out to \nJungle\nShout out to Jeff\nShout out to Big Lord\nThe big dog (Lord)\nFree Bar, Spark (Bar, Spark)\nIt's a lot going on\nFree the kings\nIt's a lot going on man, it's heavy\nGoodfellas man\nProdigy man\nIt's heavy man\nWe need to lighten it up\nTo all y'all, my bros"
