  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]\nJust breathe, just relax, it'll be okay\nJust an hour 'til your car's in the driveway\nJust the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight\nI've got my money on things goin' badly\nGot a history of stories ending sadly\nStill hoping that the fire won't burn me\nJust one time, just one time\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift]\nAll I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life\nGot a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life\nAnd I want you now, wanna need you forever\nIn the heat of your electric touch, mmm\n[Verse 2: Patrick Stump, \nTaylor Swift & Patrick Stump\n]\nI've been left in the rain lost and pining\nI'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying\n'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)\nI've gotten used to no one callin' my phone\nI've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone\nStill, I know that all it takes is to get it right\nJust one time\n, just one time\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]\nAll I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life\nGot a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life\nAnd I want you now, wanna need you forever\nIn the heat of your electric touch, mmm\n\n[Bridge: Taylor Swift, \nPatrick Stump\n]\nI was thinking just one time (\nJust one time\n)\nMaybe the stars align (\nJust one time\n)\nAnd maybe I call you mine\nAnd you won't need space\nOr string me along while you decide\nAnd just one time (\nJust one time\n)\nMaybe the moment's right (\nThe moment's right\n)\nIt's 8:05 and I see two headlights\n[Chorus: Both, \nTaylor Swift,\n \nPatrick Stump\n]\nAll I know is this could either break my heart \nor bring it back to life\nGot a feelin' your electric\n touch (\nOoh\n)\nAll I know\n is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life\nGot a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life\n (\nLife\n)\nAnd I want you now\n, wanna need you forever\nIn the heat of your electric touch, mmm"
