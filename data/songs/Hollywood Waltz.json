  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSpringtime, and the acacias are blooming\nSouthern California will see one more day\nDreamland, and bus'ness is booming\nThe birds are a singing as I drift away\n[Verse 2]\nShe looks another year older\nFrom too many lovers who used her and ran\nBut some nights, oh, she looks like an angel\nAnd she's always willing to hold you again\n[Chorus]\nSo give her this dance\nShe can't be forsaken\nLearn how to love her\nWith all of her faults\nShe gave more than she's taken\nAnd I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz\n[Verse 3]\nSpringtime and the lady is grieving\nThe lovers just stand there with nothing to say\nThey got what they wanted\nThey're packing and leaving\nTo look for another to love the same way\n\n[Chorus]\nSo give her this dance\nShe can't be forsaken\nLearn how to love her\nWith all of her faults\nShe gave more than she's taken\nAnd I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz\nThe Hollywood Waltz"
