The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'\nAl B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back— back then— then, if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, \na baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had them Lincolns and auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all\nWith the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dawg\nFuck all that flirting, I'm tryna get in some drawers\nSo put me on with these hoes, homie\nHe told me, \"Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie\"\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow, homie\n(Drive slow)\nYou never know, homie, about these hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin'\nThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'\nThem elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac\nTrunk open, screens on, \nneons lit with fifth\n, relaxed\nI'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies\nAllow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\nIt's a star-studded event when I valet park\nOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\nYou see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?\nThe disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'\nI'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab\nBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab\nA young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla\nRidin' somethin' candy-coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar\nI'm tippin' on them fours,\n \nI'm jammin' on this Screw\nI'm lookin' for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie\n[Chorus: Kanye West & \nGLC\n]\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\nDrive slow, homie\nIf you're ridin' around the city with nowhere to go\nDrive slow, homie\nLive today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n\n[Verse 3: GLC & \nKanye West\n]\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got more TVs in here than where I live\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious\nI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims\nI got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence\nYou see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced\nThat you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)\nI wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean,\n \nsmokin' on that finest Cali Green\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues\nMy cylinder quiet, like tiptoes\nI sold O's, and this, I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow (Drive slow)\n[Bridge: Tony Williams]\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, ooh\nMm, hm\nOh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh (Oh)\nMm, mm, mm, mm\n\n[Outro: Kanye West & \nTony Williams\n]\nYeah (\nOh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh\n)\nBoom, b-boom, b-boom-boom (\nMm, mm\n)\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nDrive slow, homie\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nDrive slow, homie\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\n (\nMm, hm\n)\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\nDrive slow, homie"
