  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm just the pieces of the man I used to be\nToo many bitter tears are raining down on me\nI'm far away from home, and I've been facing this alone\nFor much too long\nOh, I feel like no one ever told the truth to me\nAbout growing up and what a struggle it would be\nIn my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find\nWhere I went wrong\n[Chorus]\nToo much love will kill you\nIf you can't make up your mind\nTorn between the lover\nAnd the love you leave behind\nYou're headed for disaster\n'Cause you never read the signs\nToo much love will kill you every time\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just the shadow of the man I used to be\nAnd it seems like there's no way out of this for me\nI used to bring you sunshine\nNow all I ever do is bring you down\nMmm, how would it be if you were standin' in my shoes?\nCan't you see that it's impossible to choose?\nNo, there's no making sense of it\nEvery way I go, I'm bound to lose\nOh-oh, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nToo much love will kill you\nJust as sure as none at all\nIt will drain the power that's in you\nMake you plead and scream and crawl\nAnd the pain will make you crazy\nYou're the victim of your crime\nToo much love will kill you every time\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nYes, too much love will kill you\nIt will make your life a lie\nYes, too much love will kill you\nAnd you won't understand why\nYou'd give your life, you'd sell your soul\nBut here it comes again\nToo much love will kill you!\n[Outro]\nIn the end\nIn the end"
