  "artist": "Frank Sinatra",
  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI dim all the lights and I sink in my chair\nThe smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air\nThe walls of my room fade away in the blue\nAnd I'm deep in a dream of you\n[Verse 2]\nThe smoke makes a stairway for you to descend\nYou come to my arms, may this bliss never end\nFor we love a new just as we used to do\nWhen I'm deep in a dream of you\n[Bridge]\nThen from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing\nWe glide through a lover's refrain\nYou're so appealing that I'm soon revealing\nMy love for you over again\n[Verse 3]\nMy cigarette burns me, I wake with a start\nMy hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart\nAwake or asleep, every memory I'll keep\nDeep in a dream of you"
