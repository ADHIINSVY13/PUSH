  "lyrics": "This song from Humbug is all about the band’s own experience of success, and is absolutely full to burst with Alex Turner’s trademark obtuse metaphors.\n[Verse 1]\nTrudging through the morning\nThe tramp with the trampoline under his arm\nShifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm\nBut the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned\nAnd the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round\nIn your muddy mind, blatantly caked and\nUnwilling to wind uncooperative time\nSo he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry\n[Chorus]\nAll the pretty visitors came and waved their arms\nAnd cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall\nAll the pretty visitors came and waved their arms\nAnd cast the shadow of a snake pit on the\n[Verse 2]\nWhat came first, the chicken or the dickhead?\nSplit sleep reaps rewards from ill-fitting thoughts\nAnd twilight forced you to go on a walk\nYour legs start running and your head gets caught\nCanopy 19 is perfectly placed\nFor the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste\nYou'll have to slip away, I am unhappy to say\nBehold as the crook in the hammock plays\n\n[Chorus]\nAll the pretty visitors came and waved their arms\nAnd cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall\nAll the pretty visitors came and waved their arms\nAnd cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall\n[Bridge]\nBehold as a crook in the hammock plays\nCruelly with the base and the scales\nAnd fiddles with her feet on a balancing act\nGagged, bound, and crafting a tale\nTrailing wrapped in a gasp\nCruelly with the base and the scales\nAnd fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act\nShe was gagged, bound, and crafting a tale\nTrailing wrapped in a gasp\n[Chorus]\nAll the pretty visitors came and waved their arms\nAnd cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall\nAll the pretty visitors came and waved their arms\nAnd cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall"
