  "lyrics": "(Hey!)\n[Verse 1]\nThere was beer all over the dance floor\nAnd the band was playing rhythm and blues\nYou got down and did the gator and half an hour later\nYou were barfing all over your girlfriend's shoes\n[Chorus 1]\nBut the \nGreeks\n don't want no freaks\nThe Greeks don't want no freaks\nJust put a little smile on them rosy cheeks\nCause the Greeks don't want no freaks\n(Gator!!)\n(Yeah, woooo.... woo. Aaow!)\n[Verse 2]\nShe was the pride and the passion of Dixie\nShe did exactly what her daddy had planned\nShe was the perfect little sister until somebody missed her\nAnd they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band\n[Chorus 2]\nBut the Greeks don't want no freaks\nNo, the Greeks don't want no freaks\nSo put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks\nCause the Greeks don't want no freaks\nNo, the Greeks don't want no freaks\nSaid, the Greeks don't want no freaks\n\nJust put that monster smile on them rosy cheeks\nCause the Greeks don't want no freaks\nNo, the Greeks don't want no freaks\nAhhaaahh...."
