I know, I've been there\nBoss caught you slippin'? I know, I've been there\nSomebody beefin' with you? Man, that shit ain't rare\nJust keep it pushin'\n[Chorus: Chris Thompson]\nI saw a kid with no smile on his face today\n\"Where is my place in this bright future?\" I heard him say\n[Verse 4: Logic]\nI've been battlin' with my demons\nI'm cowardice when I see 'em\nI'm powerless, I can't beat 'em\nBut deep down, I feel like I need 'em\nPower is freedom, you can lead 'em but can't feed 'em\nSmilin' on my face but I'm dyin' under the surface\nWhat is my purpose? I'm feelin' worthless\nTell me what worth is\nMy flaws, I happily greet 'em\nImperfections, I love 'em\nMy enemies, I defeat 'em\nMan, I know somebody gon' relate to this\nIf keeping it real is a sin, you better pray for this\n'Cause I wanted this shit all my life\n'Til I finally got it and realized there's so much more to life\nUsed to dream I'd become the fuckin' man I am\nStackin' money and readin' my son \nSam I Am\nLove life, can't tell you how much a fan I am\nThis is grown folk music if you did not know\nThirty somethin', I ain't rappin' 'bout no dumb shit, ho\nKeep it real, Bobby boy ain't no kid no more\nNow keep it real, Bobby boy ain't no kid no more\nNow if you feelin' how I'm feelin', let a motherfucker know\n\n[Chorus: Chris Thompson]\nI saw a kid with no smile on his face today\n\"Where is my place in this bright future?\" I heard him say\n[Outro: Thalia]\nThis concludes the \nNo Pressure\n program\nNo Pressure\n— \nUltra 85\n, welcome to the \nUltra 85\n program"
