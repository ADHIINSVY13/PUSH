I'm not okay\nAnd if I scream, you walk away\nWhen I'm sad, you just wanna play\nI've had enough, why do I stay?\n[Chorus]\nI'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (\nOoh, ooh\n)\nI stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too\nYeah, I can see it in your face\nYou don't think I've pulled my weight\nMaybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause\nI'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you\nI'm not havin' fun tonight\n[Bridge]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nI'm not havin' fun tonight\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nI'm not havin' fun tonight\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I can see it in your face\nYou don't think I've pulled my weight\nMaybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause\nI'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you\nI'm not havin' fun tonight"
