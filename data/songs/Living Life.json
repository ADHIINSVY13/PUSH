No one knows\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen it starts to rain (Starts to rain)\nWhen the seasons change (Seasons change)\nWhen you fade away (Fade away)\nMy baby (Ooh)\nWill I be the same? (Be the same)\nWill I speak your name? (Speak your name)\nGuess it's hard to say (Hard to say)\nMy baby, baby\n[Chorus]\nJust living life, life, life (Whoa)\nJust living life, life, life (Whoa)\nJust living lifе, life, life (Whoa)\nJust living life, lifе, life (Whoa)\n[Verse 2]\nI'm still wandering alone\nTryna find a heartbeat in a home\nWishing we were set in stone\nWill you wait here when I go?\nWhat’s ahead? No one knows\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen it starts to rain (Starts to rain)\nWhen the seasons change (Seasons change)\nWhen you fade away (Fade away)\nMy baby (Ooh)\nWill I be the same? (Be the same)\nWill I speak your name? (Speak your name)\nGuess it’s hard to say (Hard to say)\nMy baby, baby\n[Chorus]\nJust living life, life, life (Whoa)\nJust living life, life, life (Whoa)\nJust living life, life, life (Whoa)\nJust living life, life, life (Whoa)"
