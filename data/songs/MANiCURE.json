  "lyrics": "“MANiCURE” is a song debuted at #SWINEFEST. It’s a catchy, electro-rock-pop beauty shop track where Gaga invites someone for a manicure and a night out. It possibly is a metaphor for us wanting to be fixed.\n[Verse 1]\nPut some lipstick on\nPerfume your neck and slip your high heels on\nRinse and curl your hair\nLoosen your hips and get a dress to wear\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm the one who's\nBeen coming 'round looking to love in you\nYou're the medicine\nI need to heal the way you make me feel\n[Chorus]\nI'm gon' be manicured\nYou wanna be man cured\nMa-ma-ma-manicure\nShe wanna be man cured\nSalon's enough for her not to feel so insecure\nMa-ma-ma-manicure\nShe wanna be take care'n of\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?\nI'm addicted to the love that you garner (Man cure)\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?\nLooking serial killer, man is a goner (Man cure)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTouch me in the dark\nPut your hands all over my body parts\nThrow me on the bed\nSqueeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause I'm the trick who's\nBeen coming 'round looking to love in you\nYou're the, the medicine\nI need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel\n[Chorus]\nI'm gon' be manicured\nYou wanna be man cured\nMa-ma-ma-manicure\nShe wanna be man cured\nSalon's enough for her\nNot to feel so insecure\nMa-ma-ma-manicure\nShe wanna be take care'n of\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan you feel it?
