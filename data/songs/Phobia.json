  "lyrics": "[Intro: Big Rube]\nThe feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle\nOf the night and somebody in yo room\nYour heart starts beating so fast, you can hear it pumping\nThe veins in your temples pulsate as you stare at the intruder\nThen after a few minutes, you realize he ain't moving\nSo finally you let 'em hang and turn on the light\nAnd the killer turns into your coat throwed over the chair\nThe feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning\nAnd two or three motherfuckers cross the street\nYour senses heighten, reflexes sharpen, vision's enhanced Adrenaline flows\nAs they rush across the street, you leave the print from the heater grip in your palm\nThen your heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just going to the store\nMany of us mistake phobia for true fear\nWhereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation\nPhobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence\nThrough stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification, they'll turn your fear switch to a permanent on We can change this by changing the small truth within the lie\nDeath is a small price to pay for respect\nDeath is a small price to pay for respect\nYou know who it is; you know what it is\nPeace out\n[Verse 1: André 3000]\nIn these troubling times, a nigga like me be thinking of rhymes\nThat makes my quarters, nickels, plus my pennies and my dimes stack\nDon't be looking for trouble, it be finding me\nTry turning the other cheek\nI understand but never mind that\nYes sir, guess the light is getting dim\nAt the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims\nI never thought thirty spokes could attract so much attention\nI gotta protect my own therefore I'm heated just like a kitchen\nFull of pots and pan, Glock's in hand\nShots, rung out like ringin' the bells\nAnd then that sucker nigga ran\nDamn, I never thought that it would come to this conclusion\nThe folks that throwed us on them boats should be the one's I'm bruisin'\nBut naw, we don't see it that way\nIn '94 this is the real, it ain't no time for play play\nBetter believe the playas on the loose\nNeed to get they head screwed on tight\nWhen it really get down to the nitty grit, who gon' fight?\nPipe, down\n'Cause ain't no better time to crank it up than right now\nWe gots the Seagram crunk down here\nAnd I don't hear nobody disagreeing\nOrga-no-i-z-e, Mr. D.J. and me and Big Boi\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nSo don't spend your whole life\nLiving it for the white\nYou got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right\nYou taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution\nI'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution\nI got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest\nI'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less\nI'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job\nEducated and black, I will resort to rob\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nSee why in the muthafuck, do niggas be acting up\nDo they want me to grab my shit and be lettin' that pistol go buck?\nSee I be gettin' stuck and stuff\nHavin' to knock a nigga out about my clout\nThat's not what it's about\nSee yes indeed I got that weed like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces\nThat nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out  and then I bounces\nI got that lyrical flow to make a ho pull up her skirt\nI drunk that Erk & Jerk, boi, thinkin' of future things to work on\nI got my fuck on and then I took my clothes off\nWashed my nuts up in the sink and then I got more nuts off\nCough, it's time to be out, sees bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp\nI'm dirtier than the shit on the back of a shrimp\nNow ain't that foul the way a nigga can spit that style\nMy nigga, I spit it, I did it, y'all suckas need to quit it\n'Cause it's real\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nSo don't spend your whole life\nLiving it for the white\nYou got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right\nYou taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution\nI'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution\nI got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest\nI'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less\nI'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job\nEducated and black, I will resort to rob\n[Verse 3]\n[Big Boi]\nWell, it's that nigga that be wearing Nautica V-necks and Polo sweats\nI got some food up in your thoughts and that cess off in your chest\nSee, living up in the Dungeon where we stayed in '93\nSee, that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yee\nAnd when we rock it, niggas be jocking just like jock itch\nYou snitch, I fucked your bitch\nSee and my niggas G'd that ho\nOn the Southside of Campbellton Road\nNo slippin' in this pimpin', she was just a horny toad\nSee, I'm a mystery like the killing of Michael Jordan's father\nWas steadily clockin' the hoes when I worked at Foot Locker\nI'm gettin' higher than learning\nSmokin' 'em up and then burning\nEast Point is on the map and now I close the curtains\n\n[André 3000]\nNow shit done got boring ass\nMolin' when XS closed down\nBut niggas kept soarin', steerin'\nStirrin', being the pharm assistant that missed\nOther folks but some people tend to joke about this\nBut it's really dead serious\nYou can bet my lyrics\nNow ya wonder why that we done stopped and got curious\nWanting to know where I'm from and where I need to be\nNow that I know comfortable living give me meat\nCan I get that; ya wonder why we split back\nLure us into pitch black dark\nBut I sit back and spark another one\nTo leave ya discombobulated in that dust\nLiving in a world where in nobody do you trust\nThen hustlin' became a major trade, but...\nUs in major trouble 'cause we made, uh...\nToo many mistakes off in the past\nThinkin' you could make it this world and now we laugh\n'Cause it's all false\nEither way ya go, ya gotta pay the cost...\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nSo don't spend your whole life\nLiving it for the white\nYou got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right\nYou taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution\nI'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution\nI got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest\nI'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less\nI'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job\nEducated and black, I will resort to rob\nSpend your whole life\nLiving it for the white\nYou got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right](2506084)\nYou taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution\nI'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution\nI got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest\nI'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less\nI'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job\nEducated and black, hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob, nigga Yeah\nTake you a li'l higher, knowwhatI'msayin'?\nWhen you learnin', when you burnin' up that smoke\nSo you can choke on my quote\nAnd get my ... down yo' throat\nYou just don't understand, youknowwhatI'msayin'?\nOrganized Noize for '95, bitch!"
