Nah, no objection at all\n'Cause both of us are still involved, so\nAs I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is\n[Chorus]\nI'm not happy here (Nah), with her\nRather have you (Yeah), rather have me too\n'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him\nRather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep\n[Verse 2]\nYou're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me\nHe's asleep, you say, \"Let's meet around three\"\nYou went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out\nYou thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah\nYou say you're going for a drive, you don't question him\nWhen he stumbles in, like, \"Where the fuck you've been?\"\nThen you pump his ear with what he wants to hear\nTell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears\nBut it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt\nYou or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt\nBut now the lines are getting super blurred\nCan't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her\nBut really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love\nHope they don't overhear us talk\n'Cause we both are getting sloppy\nProbably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not happy here (Nah), with her\nRather have you (Yeah), rather have me too\n'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him\nRather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep\n[Verse 3]\nWe're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us\n'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous\nOf each other being someone else's\nCall us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish\nBut I just wanna see ya\nDon't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6\nIf I'm there with ya, rich or poor\nWhen I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor\nI could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'\nI just wanna be your secret lover, yeah\nI'd rather share ya than to not have you at all\nSo once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it\nYeah, I'm open season\nAnd I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha\n'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring\nSo it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because\n[Chorus]\nI'm not happy here (Nah), with her\nRather have you (Yeah), rather have me too\n'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him\nRather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)"
