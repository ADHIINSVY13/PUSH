You know I got you baby\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\n\n[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]\nWell, I don't wanna do this\nNo, I don't wanna do this\nIf you're coming here sayin' that you only wanna be friends\nI don't wanna do this\nNo, I don't wanna do this\nWhen you're down for the week\nBut then you're gone for the weekend\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nIt's all gonna be okay\nIt's all gonna be okay\nIt's all gonna be okay\nI'll be waiting for you\nBaby, if you take my hand\nWe can never go nowhere\nCan't you feel love in the air?\nOh! You know I got you baby\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\n\n[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]\nSo when the lights turn off\nAnd this love don't last\nThere is one question I would ask\nIs it cause when we first started, we was movin' really fast\nIt is 'cause it was blurry and we worried about the past\nWell now baby girl, I'm startin' fresh\nEvery time I see you like we never met\nBetter yet, I'ma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris\nBaby girl, you're who I cherish\nDon't get worried about your parents\nWe gon' chill\nAnd girl I'll be your biggest crush\nWhen I walk up in the room\nGirl, You know I see you blush, hush!\nGirl, I know you feel this lust\nGirl, you always on my side, cause you know that, that's a must, yes us\n[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nIt's all gonna be okay\nIt's all gonna be okay\nIt's all gonna be okay\nI'll be waiting for you\nBaby, if you take my hand\nBaby, if you take my hand\nWe can never go nowhere\nCan't you feel love in the air\nOh! You know I got you baby"
