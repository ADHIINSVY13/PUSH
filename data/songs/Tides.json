  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI have grown up, I am a father now\nEverything has changed, but I am still the same somehow\nYou know I've never been afraid of death\nBut now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet\nI still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down\nI still know people I don't like and I should cut them out\nI feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth\n'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFreight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes\nLate-night calls, signal is in and out again\nFeelin' low on serotonin and better days\nGo, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе\n[Chorus]\nTime stops to still\nWhen you are in my arms, it always will\nAnd lifе, life is changin' tides\n[Verse 2]\nI lost the confidence in who I was\nToo busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up\nI have the same dream every night\nA bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes\nI still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down\nAnd I have people that depend on me to sort them out\nI sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace\nI've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLow fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars\nHeadline wrote, \"Princess and the face scar\"\nBroken bones, break-ins, and Babylon\nGo, go, go, but every moment you're here with me\n[Chorus]\nTime stops to still\nWhen you are in my arms, it always will\nAnd life, life is changin' tides\nTime stops to still\nWhen you are in my arms, it always will\nAnd life, life is changin' tides"
