  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm home alone, it's just me\nIt's 1 a.m., I can't sleep\nChecked my phone again\nYou're not answering\nYou're at some party downtown\nDrinking your frat boy heart out\nWith all your school friends\nWasn't invited\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut go and have fun on your own with all those girls you barely know\nAnd I'll be waiting here at home (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nYour ignorance is mixed with Fireball and wondering why you try at all\nMaybe I'm better off alone\n[Chorus]\nJust call me when you're sober\nCall me when it's over\nCall me slurring over your words from a payphone\nYeah, call me with an address\nSo I can clean up your mеss\nI'm far too in love to ever lеt you hear the tone\nAnd I'm all about having fun\nBut this is a party for one\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's 3 a.m., still no call\nI'd go to sleep but I'm so\nAngry at you, dear\nI wish you were here\nAnd then I'd get to thinking\nWith you and all that drinking\nWhat if you got hurt?\nExpecting the worst\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't understand how it's so hard to call me once while at the bar\nDo you not care about my care for you? (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)\nOh, 'cause it's so easy to ease my mind, but it cuts into your party time\nWas I wrong to ever trust you?\n[Chorus]\nJust call me when you're sober\nCall me when it's over\nCall me slurring over your words from a payphone\nYeah, call me with an address\nSo I can clean up your mess\nI'm far too in love to ever let you hear the tone\nAnd I'm all about having fun\nBut this is a party for one"
