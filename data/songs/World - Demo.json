Oh!\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nOver and over again, I ride the wheel that turns\nOver and over again, I find the soul that burns\nAnd if it has no end, the lonely heart that learns\nOver and over again, I ride the wheel that turns\n\n[Bridge]\nOh! Oh! Oh! Oh-oh\nOh! Oh! Oh!\n[Outro]\nOver and over again, I ride the wheel that turns\nOver and over again, I find the soul that burns"
