Yeah, yeah\nJust tryna get my weight up\nTryna get all my watches in order\nGet my safe up, get great\n[Verse 1]\nI'm twenty-one years past the 27 Club\nIt's like I went back into my past and then I sped it up\nRobert Johnson, Winehouse and Morrison found where Heaven was\nHeaven on Earth, \nthis shit is magic\n with no \nfairy dust\nHome of the gully, gangsta, the gruesome, and thе scary stuff\nI told my brother Jung', \"Fuck 'em, they gon' go through Hеll with us\nThey don't have the history in the streets that compare with us\"\nHood niggas, they wanna be us, thugs in the St. Regis\nOnly thing undefeated is time\nThe second is the internet, number three is this rhyme\nBefore security, my dawg had to sneak in the nine\nGod must be on my side\nI had to eat and provide, my winning streak is divine\nI told thun, \"Leave the street shit behind\nDon't let 'em hype you, a slow run beats cheatin' the grind\"\nDawg, I'm tellin' it like it is, you gotta deal with the consequence\nWhen you run in a nigga's crib, nigga, you better be ready to sit\n\n[Chorus]\nDope dealers, street hustlers, popped cases\nThrow dice, on pavement, cop chases\nBig gamblers, skullies, hide faces\nGang wars, hot spots, police raid it\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)\n[Verse 2]\nPick a down on his luck rapper, bet he broker\nThe arrogance of a crackhead mad at a weed smoker\nOr a pill taker who hate a distilled wine drinker\nA killer who use a gun to hate on a knife swinger\nAight, I get it, it's who the littest, we in competition\nY'all did it first'll be the death, I got a proposition\nYou and your brothers stop plottin' on each other, plot on millions\nEducate yourself, find ten different areas of interest\nSpread your bets out\nDouble down on what's working then you double up\nHands on your paper, they sending hate no matter what you touch\nHonestly, I'm speechless\nFly to Greece, twenty pointers on the chain, I freaked it\nLawn chair in the hood, sittin' comfortably\nI must be insane givin' you bars runnin' companies\nI'm done with the redundancies, checking on my history\nMaking content for Viacom, license music to Tiffany's\nI come from\n\n[Chorus]\nDope dealers, street hustlers, popped cases\nThrow dice, on pavement, cop chases\nBig gamblers, skullies, hide faces\nGang wars, hot spots, police raid it\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless)\nJust like when the judge read the sentence\nThrew your life away in minutes\nLeft 'em speechless (Speechless)\nThe bounce back, the greatest feeling\nWhen they thought that you was finished\nLeave 'em speechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)\nSpeechless (Speechless, speechless, speechless)"
