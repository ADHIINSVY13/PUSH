  "lyrics": "I wanna run, I want to hide\nI want to tear down the walls that hold me inside\nI want to reach out and touch the flame\nWhere the streets have no name\nI want to feel sunlight on my face\nI see the dust-cloud disappear without a trace\nI want to take shelter from the poison rain\nWhere the streets have no name\nWhere the streets have no name\nWhere the streets have no name\nWe're still building and burning down love\nBurning down love\nAnd when I go there\nI go there with you\nIt's all I can do\nThe city's a flood and our love turns to rust\nWe're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust\nI'll show you a place high on a desert plain\nWhere the streets have no name\nWhere the streets have no name\nWhere the streets have no name\nWe're still building and burning down love\nBurning down love\nAnd when I go there\nI go there with you\nIt's all I can do\n\nOur love turns to rust\nWe're beaten and blown by the wind\nSee our love turn to rust\nI'll be beaten and blown by the wind\nAnd when I go there\nI go there with you\nIt's all I can do"
