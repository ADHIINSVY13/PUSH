  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI heard church bells ringing\nI heard a choir singing\nI saw my love walk down the aisle\nOn her finger, he placed a ring\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I saw them holding hands\nShe was standing there with my man\nI heard them promise, \"'Til death do us part\"\nEach word was a pain in my heart\n[Chorus]\nAll I could do, all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)\nAll I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)\nI was losing the man that I love\nAnd all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)\n[Verse 3]\nAnd now, the wedding's over\nRice, rice has been thrown over their heads\nFor them, life has just begun\nBut mine is at an end\n[Chorus]\nAll, all I could do, all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)\nAll I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)\nI was losing the man that I love\nAnd all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)"
