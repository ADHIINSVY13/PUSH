  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat you do to me is indescribable\nGot me sparkling just like an emerald\nSet my soul on fire and make me wild\nLike the deep blue sea\nNo other boy ever made me feel beautiful\nWhen I'm in your arms, feel like I have it all\nIs it your tattoos or golden grill\nThat makes me feel this way?\n[Chorus]\nGot me spinnin' like a \nballerina\nFeelin' gangsta every time I see ya\nYou're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of\nDisaster, disaster\nGot me spinnin' like a \nballerina\nYou're the bad boy that I always dreamed of\nYou're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of\nDisaster, disaster\n[Verse 2]\nGot mascara thick, I get emotional\nYou know, I was more than just a party girl\nIsn't hard to see what's going on\nI'm so far gone (Mmm, so far gone)\nWhen I saw your face, it was incredible\nPainted on my soul, it was indelible ('Cause you're the one)\nLet's celebrate our twisted fate\nWe're the broken ones\n\n[Chorus]\nGot me spinnin' like a ballerina\nFeelin' gangsta every time I see ya\nYou're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of\nDisaster, disaster\nYou got me spinnin' like a \nballerina\nYou're the bad boy that I always dreamed of\nYou're the king and baby, I'm the queen of\nDisaster, disaster\n[Bridge]\nLadies and gentlemen\nFor the very first time!\n[Chorus]\nYou got me spinnin' like a \nballerina\nFeelin' gangsta every time I see ya\nYou're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of\nDisaster (Disaster), disaster (Disaster)\nYou got me spinnin' like a \nballerina\nYou're the bad boy that I always dreamed of\nYou're the king and I'm the \nbeauty queen\n of\nDisaster, disaster"
