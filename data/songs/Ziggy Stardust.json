  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nOh\nOh yeah\n[Verse 1]\nNow Ziggy played guitar\n, \njamming good with Weird and Gilly\nAnd the Spiders From Mars\nHe played it left hand\n, \nbut made it too far\nBecame the special man, then we were Ziggy's band\n[Verse 2]\nZiggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo\nLike some cat from Japan\nHe could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang\nHe came on so loaded, man, \nwell-hung and snow-white tan\n[Chorus 1]\nSo where were the spiders\nWhile the fly tried to break our balls?\nJust the beer light to guide us\nSo we bitched about his fans\nAnd should we crush his sweet hands?\nOh yeah\n[Verse 3]\nZiggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo\nThe kids were just crass, he was the nazz\nWith God-given ass\n, \nhe took it all too far\nBut boy, could he play guitar\n\n[Chorus 2]\nMaking love with his ego\nZiggy sucked up into his mind (ah)\nLike a leper messiah\nWhen the kids had killed the man\nI had to break up the band\n[Bridge]\nOh yeah\nOoh\n[Outro]\nZiggy played guitar"
