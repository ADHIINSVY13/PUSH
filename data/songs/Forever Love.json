  "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nI never thought that I would have to say goodbye\nBut here I am, feeling lost, tears falling from my eyes\nYou were the one who always knew just what to say\nNow I'm left with memories of you that won't fade away\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe days are colder, the nights so long\nWithout your presence, everything feels so wrong\nI search for your voice in the silence of the room\nBut all I find is the echoes of our love that once bloomed\n(Chorus)\nI'm drowning in this sеa of tears, can't find my way\nLosing someone so closе, it's the price I have to pay\nBut I'll hold onto the memories we made, they'll keep me strong\nEven though you're gone, your love will forever live on\n(Verse 2)\nI'm learning to heal, to piece together my shattered heart\nThough the pain won't vanish, I'll find a brand new start\nI'll honor your legacy, carry your spirit in every breath\nAnd keep your love alive, even in the face of death\n(Pre-Chorus)\nEvery day I wake up missing you, it's a constant ache\nTrying to find the strength to move on, for my own sake\nBut life keeps moving forward, even when I'm left behind\nAnd I'm left here, trying to mend this broken mind\n\n(Chorus)\nI'm drowning in this sea of tears, can't find my way\nLosing someone so close, it's the price I have to pay\nBut I'll hold onto the memories we made, they'll keep me strong\nEven though you're gone, your love will forever live on\n(Bridge)\nThough you're not here, you're still a part of me\nIn every beat of my heart, in every melody\nI'll keep your light shining, forever and more\nIn this R&B ballad, your love will soar\n(Chorus)\nI'm drowning in this sea of tears, can't find my way\nLosing someone so close, it's the price I have to pay\nBut I'll hold onto the memories we made, they'll keep me strong\nEven though you're gone, your love will forever live on\n(Outro)\nForever, ooh, ooh, ooh\nForever my darling\nForever love"
