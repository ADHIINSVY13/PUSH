  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe came in the bedroom\nLookin' like a photograph\nTurned to face the window\nMoonlight traced the contours of her back\nOnly she can see me\nShed the skin that guards the man\nSheltered by the ceiling\nThis is the start and end of everything\n[Chorus]\nAnd we'll go it alone\n'Cause no one will understand\nHow it just feels like flying\nHere within the confines of your bed\nHow beautiful we blend\n[Post-Chorus]\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, thеn heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\n[Verse 2]\nUnrequitеd love songs\nLonging words we used to sing\nYour faith was in the first one\nWe opened up our hearts to let them in\nAnd now all these scars are keloids\nReminding us and cautioning\nRebuild what was destroyed\nTurn it, then the chapter can begin\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we'll go it alone\n'Cause no one will understand\nHow this just feels like flying\nHere within the confines of your bed\nHow beautiful we blend\nAnd, together, we soar\nHigh over the old wasteland\nWe escaped the fire\nAnd planted roots when there was nothin' left\nHow beautiful we blend\n[Post-Chorus]\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels\nCrashin' in, head, then heels"
