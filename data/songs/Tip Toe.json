If that Rollie wasn't under your budget\nI'll never know who really got the best intentions for me\nSo I keep my circle tight and I got that Glock in my reach\nWithout a question, see me runnin' to the check, no second guesses\nSmith and Wesson if they steppin' out of line (bitch)\nWhat's on your mind, lil' bitch? I ain't got no time for this\nBack and forth, mumblin' under your breath, just tell me what the fuckin' problem is\nThese problematic bitches always want the finer things\nBut you ain't fine enough to get your finder's fee\nShe want to squall, she want assault, that's fine with me, finally\nFuckin' hoes I only thought I see inside my fantasies\nThat Phantom Ghost inspire me to do the most\nThat Honda Civic made me hungry for some foreign motors\nUpgraded to the Porsche before I drank my Folgers\nPour that forty on the soil for my fallen soldiers\nPour that forty on the soil for my dead hope\nNever going back in time, never gon' be dead broke (Bitch)"
