  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEverybody dies, surprise, surprise\nWe tell each other lies\n, sometimes, we try\nTo make it feel like we might be right\nWe might not be alone\nBe alone\n[Verse 2]\n\"Everybody dies,\" that's what they say\nAnd maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way\nI just wonder why you'd wanna stay\nIf everybody goes\nYou'd still be alone\n[Verse 3]\nI don't wanna cry, some days I do\nBut not about you\nIt's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to\nThe one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while\nI sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child\nIt's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why\nEverybody dies\nAnd when will I?\n[Verse 4]\nYou oughta know\nThat even when it's time, you might not wanna go\nBut it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold\nBut you are not alone\nYou are not unknown"
