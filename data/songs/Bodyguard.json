(Living in my protection)\nWe can just get ignited\nWhat we had never known all our lives\nI pray it's not too late\nI would die by your side my love\nI'm the life that you save\n[Bridge: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]\nIn this world of pain and sorrow\nEvery wish is your command\nA heart like yours should never live alone\nI used to dream of a special one\nAnd now I feel it's coming true\nBut I couldn't let go, I'm a jealous guy\nWhat you're putting me through\n[Chorus] [x2]"
