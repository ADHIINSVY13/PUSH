Amazing grace, protects you like a glove\nAnd I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face\n[Verse 1]\nHas anybody here seen Razor Face?\nI heard he's back, and looking for a place, to lay down\nMust be getting on\nNeeds a man who's young to walk him around\nNeeds a man who's young to walk him around\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, Razor Face, my old friend\nI'll meet you down by the truck stop inn\nWith a bottle of booze in the back of my car\nYou're a song on the lips of an aging star\nRazor Face, ooh!
