  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI can’t be bothered with paying homage to forefathers\nSee the future like the car show floor models\nBoth feet in the snow, so that my core follows\nWe don’t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles\nDrown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos\nStarted with similac powder in a baby bottle\nThe formula is warning ya\nCrack kills offerings to the coroner\nKill my eldest brother? Nigga, I’ll be damned\nGator at my momma’s house, welcome to zombie land\nA hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice\nDown 40 but a streak will have you square by night\nDidn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face\nCause the batter I add had the coca base\nWhen you get to heaven’s door they won’t hold a space\nIf you numb like the flesh on a smoker’s face\nThere’s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right\nYou in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right\nYou know you’re up when you count a quarter mil in white\nAnd if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight\nI’m a wizard at it, nigga here’s the magic\nMake a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it\nGet the green from the scale like a lizard had it\nBear witness as I unveil this instant classic\n\n[Hook]\nYes! My God!\n[Verse 2]\nThe Second Coming is in the second verse\nThe first coming still here, so I’ll need a hearse\nI got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse\nNot only do they say they feel it but say it hurts\nNo pain, no gain, nigga\nThey say I’m heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga\nNo matter the success, still the same nigga\nI only change when the new body came, nigga\nAerodynamic, roof panoramic\nMy credit score let the dealer take full advantage\nPaid over sticker price, cash under handed\nThe 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit\nGotta time manage when you heaving snow\nAble to drop it all at 30 and be free to go\nOnly deal with divas on a need to know\nAnd what you need to know is when you need to go\nThey’ll be no waiting, I have no patience\nThis is the end for all my unrecognized greatness\nI’m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness\nYou can hear in every bar and every cadence\nIt’s the new god flow, ain’t it\nThe last supper for you niggas now repainted\nTake position on the chess board and rearrange it\nFace to face with the truth, get reacquainted\n\n[Hook]"
