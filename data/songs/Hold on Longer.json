  "lyrics": "The seventh track for Love In The Future. The song is about a troubled relationship – he is asking her to hold on even though bigger ‘waves’ will come – using the sea/ocean as a metaphor for their relationship.\n[Produced by 88 Keys, Dave Tozer & Kanye West]\n[Verse 1]\nBroken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods\nBut I won’t run, I’m with you, that’s enough\nKiss me now so you won’t run\n[Hook]\nOut of breath underwater\nGirl you can hold on longer\nGirl you can hold on longer\nGirl you can hold on longer\nLong as you want\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n[Verse 2]\nLove is an ocean\nSwimming and try not to drown\nRight in the waves\nPraying we don’t go down\nIn the undertow I’ll pull you out\n[Hook]\nOut of breath underwater\nGirl you can hold on longer\nGirl you can hold on longer\nGirl you can hold on longer\nLong as you want\nOh, oh, oh, oh"
