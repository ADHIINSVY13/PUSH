Who do I trust?\nMaybe it's real, or maybe I'm just...\n[Breakdown]\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\n[Verse 2]\nNever felt so naked\nLookin' at you naked\nGot your hands down the back of my soul\nAnd the more that I show you, the more I'm afraid\nThat you're going to wake up\nAnd realize I'm not the one\nThat you thought I was, that I thought I was\nAm I who I am who am I?\n\n[Chorus]\nMaybe it's a case of paranoia\nNervous that I'll never really know ya\nWhat do I feel? Who do I trust?\nMaybe it's real, or maybe I'm just...\n[Breakdown]\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\n[Outro]\nCrazy\nBut baby, I love you\nAnd baby I'd love to not be...\nParanoid\nParanoid, mm\nI wish I wasn't\nParanoid, mm-mm\nMaybe I'm justâ€“"
