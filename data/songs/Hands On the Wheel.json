  "lyrics": "At a time when the world seems to be spinnin' hopelessly out of control\nThere's deceivers an' believers an' old in-betweeners\nThat seem to have no place to go\nWell, it's the same old song, it's right an' it's wrong\nAn' livin' is just somethin' that I do\nAn' with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes\nAn' I found myself in you\nI looked to the stars, tried all of the bars\nAn' I've nearly gone up in smoke\nNow my hand's on the wheel, I've something that's real\nAn' I feel like I'm goin' home\nAn' in the shade of an oak down by the river\nSit an old man an' a boy\nSettin' sail, spinnin' tales an' fishin' for whales\nWith a lady they both enjoy\nWell, it's the same damn tune, it's the man in the moon\nIt's the way that I feel about you\nAn' with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes\nAn' I found myself in you\nAn' I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars\nAn' I've nearly gone up in smoke\nNow my hand's on the wheel, I've something that's real\nAn' I feel like I'm goin' home\nInstrumental break"
