We'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uh—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...\nYou'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn't matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...\nBut, it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, is we're bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up \"their\" children, to do the same thing. So, it's all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question...\n\"What do I desire?\"\n[Outro]\nThe Incredible True Story\nAnd Transformation of the Man Who Saved the World\n[\nScene VII\n]\n[THALIA:]\nSurface contact in 400 meters...\n300 meters...\n200 meters...\nTime of day is 6:28 Constant Meridian\n328 feet...\nOxygen: 100%\nTemperature is 17 degrees Celsius\n[KAI:]\nMan... what are the chances that there's some big-ass creature out there that's going to eat us?\n[THALIA:]\n100%\n(\nLaughter\n)\n[KAI:]\nFuck...\n[THALIA:]\nClear skies—\n[THOMAS:]\nKai, which Tarantino film do you think Logic liked best?\n[KAI:]\nI would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill\n[THALIA:]\n114 feet—\n[KAI:]\nMan, stylistically he's like—what’s the name of that bitch? The lead character? I forgot her name, but he's like that bitch—with like some Kung-Fu shit he's like with his raps. It's fucking crazy!\n[THOMAS:]\nYou know in—in Pulp Fiction I mean—the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it's the same feel for me with his raps you know? There's thought behind it...\n[KAI:]\nNo, I could see that, I could see that but...\nBut nah man, fuck that man! Kill Bill was the shit!!\nEspecially like knives throwing and dodging and shit—and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other's heads off! What the fuck is that?!\n[THOMAS:]\nYeah, fuck it—\n[THAILIA:]\nPrepare for surface landing!\n[THOMAS:]\nYou're right, hot chicks and Kung-Fu, can't beat that...\n[KAI:]\nYeah, can't beat that at all...\n[THALIA:]\nSurface contact in:\n10... 9... 8... 7... 6...\n5... 4... 3... 2... 1!\n[KAI:]\nAre you ready for this?\n[THOMAS:]\nAre you?\n(\nSounds of birds chirping, air, etc.\n)\n[THOMAS:]\nWait, wait—what's that sound?\n(\nSounds grow, then abruptly stop\n)\n[THALIA:]\nLife..."
