  "lyrics": "You've got a famous last name\nBut you're not to blame\nBaby, I see you for who you are\nA one-time apple queen\nAnd a one-time tramp\nAnd an old-time movie star\nYou're a shell picker\nOf the pickiest kind\nBut you always find the ones to keep\nAnd in or out of bed\nYou keep your head wide open\n'Cause you don't only dream when you're asleep\nLike a child, you remember\nBut I forget all my dreams\nI used to think\nThat someday I'd relax a little\nAnd be more like you\nThen I realized\nHow silly that thought was\nI needed to stand in my own shoes\nAnd from over here\nI can see you cry\nDon't even try to pretend\n'Cause he's hurt you\nSo many times\nBaby, don't go back again\n\nLike a child, you forget\nBut I remember everything and every sting\nAnd through all the games\nWe'll both stay the same\nAs we've always been\nThrough the fat and the thin\nUntil the end\nUntil the end"
