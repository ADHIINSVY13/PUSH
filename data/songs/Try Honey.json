I'm gonna try honey\nHold on\nHold on\nWon't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey\nHold on (Hold on)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey\nHold on (Hold on)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey\n[Outro]\nYou said \"oh my, oh my, oh my\"\nYou're never there for me, you're never there for me\nYou said \"oh my, oh my, oh my\"\nYou're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey\nYou said \"oh my, oh my, oh my\"\nYou're never there for me, you're never there for me\nAnd you said \"oh my, oh my, oh my\"\nYou're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey\nI'm gonna try honey\nWon't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey\nHold on\nHold on\nWon't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey"
