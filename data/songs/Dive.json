(What's your history?)\nDo you have a tendency to lead some people on?\n'Cause I heard you do, mm\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI could fall or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHangin' on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nAnd lie awake every day\nDon't know how much I can take\n[Chorus]\nSo don't call me \"baby\"\nUnless you mean it\nAnd don't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nSo let me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\n[Intrumental Break]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMm, I could fall or I could fly\nHere in your aeroplane\nAnd I could live, I could die\nHangin' on the words you say\nAnd I've been known to give my all\nSittin' back, lookin' at\nEvery mess that I made\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't call me \"baby\"\nUnless you mean it\nAnd don't tell me you need me\nIf you don't believe it\nAnd let me know the truth\nBefore I dive right into you\nBefore I dive right into you\nAnd before I dive right into you"
