  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm in the mood for love\nSimply because you're near me\nFunny but when you're near me\nI'm in the mood for love\n[Verse 2]\nHeaven is in your eyes\nBright as the stars we're under\nOh, is it any wonder\nI'm in the mood for love\n[Bridge]\nWhy stop to think of whether\nThis little dream might fade?\nWe've put our hearts together\nNow we are one, I'm not afraid\n[Verse 3]\nIf there's a cloud above\nAnd it must rain, we'll let it\nBut for tonight, forgеt it\nI'm in the mood for love"
