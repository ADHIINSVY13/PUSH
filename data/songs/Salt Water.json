  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's still so far to go and I can't feel my toes\nWhen the rain soaks through the heels and slips to the sole\nYeah, the blades are two feet tall, I wade in green\nI'm movin' forward, to where? God only knows\nFeel the wind's harsh refrain like the clouds gripped my face\nSaying, \"It's alright to run from all this pain\"\nOh, and when it's time to go with one last breath that's in my lungs\nI'll scream, \"It's all for love,\" I'll scream, \"It's all for love\"\n[Chorus]\nCome and kiss me, salt water\nOh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees\nI'm free in salt water\nEmbrace the deep and leave everything\nIt was just a dream\n[Verse 2]\nI can see it up ahead where the sky meets the ground\nAnd after that, there's only moving grey\nI am filled up with regret\nWith things I did or never said, just leave that well alone\n[Chorus]\nAnd come kiss me, salt water\nOh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees\nI'm free in salt water\nEmbrace the deep and leave everything\nIt was just a dream\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Ah-ah)\nIt was just a dream\nIt was just a dream\n(Ah-ah)\nIt was just a dream\nWas it just a dream?\n[Bridge]\nNow, I'm standing on the edge, gazing into hell\nOr is it somethin' else? I just can't tell\nWhen there's nothin' left, I close my eyes and take one step\nAnd say, \"Well, here it goes,\" I say, \"Well, here it goes\"\n[Chorus]\nCome and kiss me, salt water\nOh, finally, I feel, at three or four degrees\nI'm free in salt water\nEmbrace the deep and leave everything\nIt was just a dream"
