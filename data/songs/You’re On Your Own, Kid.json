  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSummer went away, still, the yearning stays\nI play it cool with the best of them\nI wait patiently, he's gonna notice me\nIt's okay, we're the best of friends\nAnyway\nI hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys\nI touch my phone as if it's your face\nI didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out\nThere's just one who could make me stay\nAll my days\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\nI waited ages to see you there\nI search the party of better bodies\nJust to learn that you never cared\n[Chorus]\nYou're on your own, kid\nYou always have been\n[Verse 2]\nI see the great escape,\n \nso long, Daisy May\nI picked the petals, he loves me not\nSomething different bloomed, writing in my room\nI play my songs in the parking lot\nI'll run away\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\nI called a taxi to take me there\nI search the party of better bodies\nJust to learn that my dreams aren't rare\n[Chorus]\nYou're on your own, kid\nYou always have been\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Bridge]\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\nI gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this\nI hosted parties and starved my body\nLike I'd be saved by a perfect kiss\nThe jokes weren't funny\n, \nI took the money\nMy friends from home don't know what to say\nI looked around in a blood-soaked gown\nAnd I saw something they can't take away\n'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned\nEverything you lose is a step you take\nSo, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it\nYou've got no reason to be afraid\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're on your own, kid\nYeah, you can face this\nYou're on your own, kid\nYou always have been"
