That's Pablo\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & \nKanye West\n]\nTake my heart, run (Take my heart, run)\nJust don't go numb (Just don't go numb)\nJust don't go dumb (Just don't go dumb)\nLet's have some fun (Let's have some fun)\nPull out your tongue (Pull out your tongue, yeah)\nWhat you waitin' on? (What you waitin' on?)\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo\nTake my heart, run (Take my heart, run)\nJust don't go numb (Just don't go numb)\nJust don't break nothin' (Just don't break nothin')\nLet's just have fun (Let's just have fun)\nPull out your tongue (Pull out your tongue)\nWhat you waitin' on? (What you waitin' on?)\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo\n[Verse 1: Kanye West \nwith Marilyn Manson\n]\nI like to think the world is mine (Chi', Chi', Chi', Chi')\nSome folks say that love is blind (Chi', Chi', Chi', Chi')\nShow me around, I'm new in town (Chi', Chi', Chi', Chi')\nPick me up before I drown (Chi', Chi', Chi')\nPick me up before I drown\nThey're putting shovels in the ground\nBuild me up to tear me down\nBut if I melt, then we all drown\nWe the culture, you late\nWe do things that you can't\nIf I withdraw, they gon'\nMake some real calls to banks\nBorn real and you ain't\nStill the old me, new hate\nNew hate, new hate, new hate\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & \nKanye West\n]\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo\nTake my heart, run (Take my heart, run)\nJust don't go numb (Just don't go numb)\nJust don't go dumb (Just don't go dumb)\nLet's have some fun (Let's have some fun)\nPull out your tongue (Pull out your tongue)\nWhat you waitin' on? (What you waitin' on?)\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo\nTake my heart, run (Take my heart, run)\nJust don't go numb (Just don't go numb)\nJust don't go dumb (Just don't go dumb)\nLet's have some fun (Let's have some fun)\nPull out your tongue (Pull out your tongue)\nWhat you waitin' on? (What you waitin' on?)\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo\n[Verse 2: Future]\nI can send a blitz, turn you to your ashtray, you gon' have a bad day\nPull up with a stick, three thousand shots, André\nTop of the world, **** get starstruck, I just be oiled up\nCalm my nerves, hangin' with narcos, shoot like vato\nBales at the loft, I can go golf, mm\nFlyin' out to New York, she good with her arch\nRick James, drip on my cloth\nWhy must I explain? I'm with my dog right or wrong\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & \nKanye West\n]\nTake my heart, run (\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo,\n take my heart, run)\nJust don't go numb (Just don't go numb)\nJust don't go dumb (Just don't go dumb)\nLet's have some fun (Let's have some fun)\nPull out your tongue (Pull out your tongue, yeah)\nWhat you waitin' on? (What you waitin' on?)\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo\nTake my heart, run (Take my heart, run)\nJust don't go numb (Just don't go numb)\nJust don't break nothin' (Just don't break nothin')\nLet's just have fun (Let's just have fun)\nPull out your tongue (Pull out your tongue)\nWhat you waitin' on? (What you waitin' on?)\nWho they waitin' on? That's Pablo"
