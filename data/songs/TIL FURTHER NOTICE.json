(21)\nI thought about givin' you the key to my heart, but it's froze\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & James Blake, \nJames Blake\n, \nTravis Scott\n]\nWhere would you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\nWhere would you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\nWhere would you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\nWhere would you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\n'Til further notice\n (\nAh-ah\n)\n'Til further notice\n (\nAh-ah\n)\n'Til further notice\n (\nWe'll keep you posted\n, \nah-ah\n)\n'Til further notice\n (\nWe'll keep you posted\n)\n[Bridge: Travis Scott]\n(Ooh) If energy makes energy\nX-rated love, X-rated love\nIf energy makes energy, makes energy\nX-rated love, X-rated love (Mm, ha, ha)\n[Verse 3: Travis Scott]\nYou know the love was X-rated, it's how we made it\nDrinkin' help balance the patience, watch how you take it\nCan't keep no bitches, it's too dangerous, I been X-rated\nTook everything up for the takin', I couldn't save it\nSee red and blues, I hit the pavement\nGot low, got vacant\nShe needed angles, I need angels\nI'm fightin' Satan\nLeave me faded, I feel painless\nI go out gracious\nI'm tryna feel the shade of greatness by celebratin'\nBring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus\nShe fall more in love every time that I tip\nI fade away every time that I\nTake a sip, I been goin' off the rip\nI been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit\nI know one thing 'bout the old one, can have more fun with it\nKnew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick\nEven if she at the shows, so she never let 'em hit\nAlways knew she always on one and I can bare with it\nYeah, I can bare with it\n\n[Chorus: James Blake]\nWhere will you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\nWhere will you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\nWhere will you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\nWhere will you go now\nNow that you're done with me?\n'Til further notice\n'Til further notice\n'Til further notice (We'll keep you posted)\n'Til further notice (We'll keep you posted)"
