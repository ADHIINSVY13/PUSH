  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou're just a small bump unborn\nIn four months, you're brought to life\nYou might be left with my hair\nBut you'll have your mother's eyes\nI'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can\nBut for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans\nA small bump, in four months, you're brought to life\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I'll whisper quietly\nI'll give you nothin' but truth\nIf you're not inside me\nI'll put my future in you\n[Chorus]\nYou are my one and only\nAnd you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb\nAnd hold me tight\nOh, you are my one and only\nYou can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb\nAnd hold me tight\nAnd you'll be all right\n[Verse 2]\nOoh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin\nWith a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin\nFinger nails the size of a half grain of rice\nAnd eyelids closed to be soon opened wide\nA small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I'll hold you tightly\nI'll tell you nothin' but truth\nIf you're not inside me\nI'll put my future in you\n[Chorus]\nYou are my one and only\nAnd you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb\nAnd hold me tight\nOh, you are my one and only\nYou can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb\nAnd hold me tight\nAnd you'll be all right\n[Bridge]\nAnd you can lie with me\nWith your tiny feet\nWhen you're half asleep\nI'll leave you be\nRight in front of me\nFor a couple weeks\nSo I can keep you safe\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you are my one and only\nYou can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb\nAnd hold me tight\nOh, you are my one and only\nYou can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb\nAnd hold me tight\nAnd you'll be all right\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause you were just a small bump unborn\nFor four months then torn from life\nMaybe you were needed up there\nBut we're still unaware as why"
