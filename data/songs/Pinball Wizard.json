  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEver since I was a young boy I played the silver ball\nFrom Soho down to Brighton I must've played them all\nBut I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall\nThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n[Verse 2]\nHe stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine\nFeeling all the bumpers, always playing clean\nHe plays by intuition, the digit counters fall\nThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n[Chorus]\nHe's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist\nA pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist\n[Post-Chorus]\n(How do you think he does it?) I don't know\n(What makes him so good?)\n[Verse 3]\nWell, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells\nDon't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell\nAlways has a replay, \nnever tilts at all\nThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n\n[Chorus]\nHe can't beat me now, I've always been the champ\nI know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand\n[Bridge]\n(Oh, can't explain)\n(Oh, can't explain)\n(Oh, can't explain)\n(Oh, can't explain)\n[Verse 4]\nEven on my usual table he can beat the best\nHis disciples lead him in and he just does the rest\nHe's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall\nThat deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n[Chorus]\nHe's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist\nA pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist\nHe's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more\nA pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord\nHe's scoring more, he's scoring more\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nI thought I was the Bally table king\nBut I just handed my pinball crown to him\nTo him, to him"
