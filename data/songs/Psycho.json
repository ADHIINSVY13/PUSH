I lost her\nHer head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her\nAnd put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub\nWhen I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up\nThe hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up\nIn Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit up nauseous\nLook deep in my eye, see many-many men die\nI swing gem stars faster than a Samurai\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nYou see I'm a psycho (A psycho), a sicko (A sicko)\nI'm crazy (I'm crazy, I'm crazy)\nI say I got my knife pulled (Knife pulled)\nI'll kill you (I'll kill you) if you made me (You made me)\nThey wanna see me shot up (Shot up)\nLocked up (Locked up), then cage me (Cage me)\nI'll come back bigger (Bigger)\nStronger (Stronger) and angry (And angry)"
