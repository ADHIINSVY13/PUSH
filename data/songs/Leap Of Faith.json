  "lyrics": "After my baby quit me\nI wouldn't even go outside\nWhen my friends tried to fix me up\nI crawl under my bed and hide\nI knew I was never gonna change my look\nTill I got my [Incomprehensible] up to try\nAnd when I went ahead and spread my wings\nI found out that I could fly\nSometime, all it takes is a leap of faith\n(Leap of faith)\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith\n(Leap of faith)\nI had no way of knowing\nWhat would come from our first kiss\nIt scares me now to think about\nThe good love that I might have missed\nI was just tryin' to find some help\nTryin' to see myself as a survivor\nI had to rise up from the ashes of love\nAnd jump back into the fire\nSometime, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah\n(Leap of faith)\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith\n(Leap of faith)\n\nSometimes, you gotto believe\nBefore you see the proof\nYou can wait a lifetime\nFor one moment of truth\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith\nYeah, oh yeah\nYou gotto believe\nBefore you see the proof\nYou can wait a lifetime\nFor one moment of truth\nOh yeah, sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith\nSometimes, all it takes\n(Leap of faith)\nSometimes, all it takes\n(Leap of faith)\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does\n(Leap of faith)\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith\n(Leap of faith)\nOh, sometimes, all it takes\n(Leap of faith)\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah\n(Leap of faith)\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does\nSometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith"
