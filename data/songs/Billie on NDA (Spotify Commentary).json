  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\n\"NDA\" is kind of all over the map... it's got a lot of different things going on, that were completely different situations. It's really just, like, things that I was thinking and feeling and... doing in my life and I was like \"I'm just gonna write about it\" [repeats babbling the same thing and laughs]. Um... I don't know, I think it's very cool but... \"NDA\" is very... all over the place and up for interpretation, really."
