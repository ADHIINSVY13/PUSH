  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI am someone who until recent events\nYou shared your secrets with\nAnd your location, you forgot to turn it off\nAnd so I watch as you walk\nInto some bar called The Black Dog\nAnd pierce new holes in my heart\nYou forgot to turn it off\nAnd it hits me\n[Chorus]\nI just don't understand\nHow you don't miss me in The Black Dog\nWhen someone plays \"The Starting Line\"\nAnd you jump up, but \nshe's too young to know this song\nThat was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming\nOld habits die screaming\n[Verse 2]\nI move through the world with the heartbroken\nMy longings stay unspoken\nAnd I may never open up thе way I did for you\nAnd all of those best laid plans\nYou said I needed a bravе man\nThen proceeded to play him\nUntil I believed it too\nAnd it kills me\n\n[Chorus]\nI just don't understand\nHow you don't miss me in the shower\nAnd remember how my rain-soaked body\nWas shakin', do you hate me?\nWas it hazing? For a cruel fraternity\nI pledged and I still mean it\nOld habits die screaming\n[Bridge]\nSix weeks of breathin' clean air\nI still miss the smoke\nWere you makin' fun of me\nWith some esoteric joke?\nNow I wanna sell my house\nAnd set fire to all my clothes\nAnd hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons\nEven if I die screaming\nAnd I hope you hear it\n[Chorus]\nAnd I hope it's shitty in\n \nThe Black Dog\nWhen someone plays \"The Starting Line\"\nAnd you jump up, but she's too young to know this song\nThat was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming\n'Cause tail between your legs\n, \nyou're leavin'\n\n[Outro]\nI still can't believe it\n'Cause old habits die screaming"
