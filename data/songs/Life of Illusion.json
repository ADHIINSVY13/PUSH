  "lyrics": "Cover of Joe Walsh, sung by drummer Taylor Hawkins.\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I can't help feeling that I'm\nLiving a life of illusion\nAnd oh, why can't we let it be\nAnd see through the hole in this wall of confusion\nI just can't help the feeling I'm\nLiving a life of illusion\n[Verse 2]\nPow, right between the eyes\nOh, how nature loves her little surprises\nWow, it all seems so logical now\nIt's just one of her better disguises\nAnd it comes with no warning\nNature loves her little surprises\nContinual crisis\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Verse 3]\nHey, don't you know it's a waste of your day\nCaught up in endless solutions\nThat have no meaning, just another hunch\nBased upon jumping conclusions\nEndless solutions\nBacked up against a wall of confusion\nLiving a life of illusion\nLiving a life of illusion\nLiving a life of illusion"
