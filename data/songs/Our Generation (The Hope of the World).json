(Straighten it out)\nGotta straighten it out! (Straighten it out)\nStraighten it out! (Straighten it out)\nYeahhh we gon' straighten it out, yeahh!\n\n[CL Smooth]\nAs long as there's a you, there's a better me\nIt's why we're together and stronger than they ever thought it could be\nA world motherless - can health care cover this?\nA love for all people no matter what the culture is\nOur generation, is makin huge strides\nA self-empowering movement that's on the rise\nThe more the door is open, the more the youth can see\nA fair chance means a greater opportunity\nTo have a brighter future, deeper insight\nWork hard to be anything you want in life\nIt's what it's all about, the longevity\nEducated enough to know what's ahead of me\nNeed to straighten it out, seek and you'll find\nThey can cage your body, but not your mind\nWe lay it all on the line in the struggle\nWe grew, but together here's what we gotta do\n[John Legend]\nOur generation (let's straighten it out)\nIt's all left up to us (let's straighten it out)\nOur generation (let's straighten it out)\nLet's do just what we must, and straighten it out!\n[JL with background singers]\nOur generation - straighten it out!\nLet's straighten it out - and straighten it out!\nHeyyyyyyyyy we can straighten it out, YEAHHH!\nC'mon yeah! Our generation - let's straighten it out\nHey hey, we'll straighten it out\nWe'll straighten it out - straighten it out\nNew York City, better straighten it out\nAtlanta, better straighten it out\nIn Los Angeles, you better straighten it out\nWe can straighten it out, we can straighten it out\n{*fades out*}"
