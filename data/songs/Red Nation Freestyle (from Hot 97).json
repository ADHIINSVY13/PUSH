Of course, the beat is from Game’s single, “Red Nation”, from his fourth album, The R.E.D. Album.\n[Verse 1]\nAs I get hotter, haters get madder\nEscalator up...fuck a ladder!\nSuccess callin', your world's shattered\nThey say it's destiny; to me, it never mattered\nDrug overlord, they put me over Lord\nSay you gettin' money, we goin' overboard\nNew Years with my bitch in the Palm suite\nMink was like Ocho-Cinco with the blonde streak\nThe Don Dotta, the kingpin\nI jump squares on you muthafuckas; king him\nLebron's on 'em, \nthe coupe's Bond on 'em\nThe Aston was ice-blue, I went Tron on 'em\nNow handle that, bitch, handle that\nWhite dripping off the pot like candle wax\nLet it dry then it's on to the next one\nI'm Raekwon in the kitchen when I chef one\n[Verse 2]\nI'm light-years beyond Balenciaga pythons\nYou put 'em back after you try 'em on\nI'm pushin' kilos; \nit's a pie-a-thon\nForklifting the palate, nigga, pile it on\nCocaine cowboys, no spurs, but I'm stylin' on\nEvery bird got my talons on\nRun the Late Night, get my Jimmy Fallon on\nRequest love (With ?uestlove) on that price that they peggin' on\nI beat a different drum\nG.O.O.D. Music, but I speak it with a different tongue\nThe numb one becomes number 1\nSee us Grammy night; bow ties and cummerbunds\nCiroc soak bad bitch, I'm layin' under one\nMake her work for it, night nurse for it\nIn the morning she can get her heel and purse for it\nWitch-doctor flow, you could say I'm cursed for it\nThe way I'm killin' shit, you should send a hearse for it\nPush!"
