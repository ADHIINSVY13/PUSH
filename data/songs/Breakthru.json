Oh, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour smile speaks \nbooks\n to me\nI break up with each and every one of your looks at me\nHoney, you're starting something\nDeep inside of me\nHoney, you're sparking something\nThis fire in me\nI'm outta control, I want to rush\nHeadlong into this ecstasy\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough!\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nOh, yeah\n[Instrumental Break]\n(Breakthrough)\n(Breakthrough)\n(Breakâ€”)\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthrough\n[Outro]\nBreakthrough!"
