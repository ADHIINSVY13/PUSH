  "lyrics": "“For All The Cows” is a near nonsensical song that involves Grohl rambling about what people say about him, what he thinks, and what he’s going to do about it all.\n[Verse 1]\nI'm called a cow\nI'm not about to blow it now for all the cows\nFor all the cows\nIt's funny how\nMoney allows all to browse and be endowed\nThis wish is true\nIt falls into pieces new, \nthe cow is you\nThe cow is you\n[Chorus]\nMy kind has all run out\nAs if kinds could blend\nSome time if time allows\nEverything worn in, everything worn in\nEverything worn in like it's a friend\n[Verse 2]\nI said you're all\nA painted doll, and it caused the walls to fall\nHow far is he?\nImpatiently, that's as far as far can be\nAs far could be\n[Chorus]\nMy kind has all run out\nAs if kinds could blend\nSome time if time allows\nEverything worn in, everything worn in\nEverything worn in like it's a friend\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm called a cow\nI'm not about to blow it now for all the cows\nIt's funny how\nMoney allows all to browse and be endowed\nAnd be endowed\n[Chorus]\nMy kind has all run out\nAs if kinds could blend\nSome time if time allows\nEverything worn in, everything worn in\nEverything worn in like it's a friend"
