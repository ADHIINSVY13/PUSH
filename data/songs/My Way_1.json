  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAnd now, the end is near\nAnd so I face the final curtain\nMy friend, I'll say it clear\nI'll state my case, of which I'm certain\nI've lived a life that's full\nI traveled each and every highway\nAnd more, much more than this\nI did it my way\n[Verse 2]\nRegrets, I've had a few\nBut then again, too few to mention\nI did what I had to do\nAnd saw it through without exemption\nI planned each charted course\nEach careful step along the byway\nAnd more, much more than this\nI did it my way\n[Chorus]\nYes, there were times, I'm sure you knew\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew\nBut through it all, when there was doubt\nI ate it up and spit it out\nI faced it all, and I stood tall\nAnd did it my way\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've loved, I've laughed and cried\nI've had my fill, my share of losing\nAnd now, as tears subside\nI find it all so amusing\nTo think I did all that\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way\nOh, no, oh, no, not me\nI did it my way\n[Chorus]\nFor what is a man, what has he got?\nIf not himself, then he has naught\nTo say the things he truly feels\nAnd not the words of one who kneels\nThe record shows I took the blows\nAnd did it my way\n[Outro]\nYes, it was my way"
