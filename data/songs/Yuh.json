(Yuh)\nBust out the scene, they like, \"Who there?\"\nThat's me, lil' ho, deep in your hole\nBeat on the low for the most\nGettin' money in my coast\nGotta keep the MAC tucked by the coat\nI ain't selling no bars, you can't even get a quote\nDick be the antidote for you rappers with my name in your throat\nI do it for my people\nI do it for them boys that got stuck on that needle (Bitch)\nDoin' drugs in a tub full of lean (Yuh)\nDon't get no love from my family (No)\n.357 be the remedy, my mind is the enemy (Ayy, ayy, blah)\nMore money, more people wanna be a friend of me (Bitch)\nBitch can't even get in front of me (Bitch)\nI got a front man that would never dare front on me, yuh\n\n[Outro]\nYuh"
