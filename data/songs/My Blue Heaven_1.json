  "lyrics": "When whippoorwills call and evening is nigh\nI hurry to my blue heaven\nJust a turn to the right, you'll find a little white light\nWill lead you to my Blue Heaven\nYou'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy little room\nA little nest that nestles where the roses bloom\nJust Marley and me, and baby makes three\nWe're happy in my blue heaven\nYou'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy little room\nA little nest that nestles where the roses bloom\nJust Marley and me, and baby makes three\nWe're happy in my blue heaven\nSo happy in my blue heaven"
