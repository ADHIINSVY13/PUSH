I ... I ...\nKiss (kiss) kiss (kiss) kiss me on my lips\nWe've been dancin round the moment now we're doin it\nThen breathe (breathe) breathe (breathe) a sigh of sweet relief\nWe been holding it so long the wait was killing me\nOh and we oh and we have been waiting for\nSo baby open your mind while I close the door\nOh girl\nYou've been my best friend\nCan we put this to bed then\nTonight's the night to cross the line\nBaby won't you be mine\nNot just my home girl\nTime that I take you home girl\nTonight's the night to cross the line\nLet me love you night\n\nI ... I ... I ...\nDon't let this moment slip away\nCause we'll never know unless we try it someday\nIf you're ready I'm so ready\nTonight's the night\nTonight's the night\nOh girl\nYou've been my best friend\nCan we put this to bed then\nTonight's the night to cross the line\nBaby won't you be mine\nNot just my home girl\nTime that I take you home girl\nTonight's the night to cross the line\nLet me love you night"
