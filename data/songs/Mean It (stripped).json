(\nIf you don't mean it\n)\nYou've been staring at me with a heart of doubt (\nAh\n)\n[Chorus: Lauv & Paul Klein]\nDon't kiss me right now\nDon't tell me that you need me\nDon't show up at my house\nAll caught up in your feelings\nDon't run me 'round and 'round\nDon't build me up just to let me down\nJust to let me down, down, down (Hey)\nDon't mess with my head (My head)\nDon't tell me you're falling (Hey)\nWith your feet still on the ledge (Hey)\nI'm all out of breath (Hey, yeah)\nBaby, don't run me 'round and 'round\nDon't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right now\nOn your lips, just leave it\nIf you don't mean it"
