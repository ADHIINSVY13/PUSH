For the lights in the night\nThe way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight\nDamn, I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols\nI survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner\nYou can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga\nI mean, like every time a nigga blink, I'm throwin' on the mink\nAnd she don't want to dance, unless she drink (\nI be wonderin'\n)\nWill this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?\nBookmarked a lot haters, I added more links\nRollin' with the same niggas who was rollin' with niggas that was on E\nWonder why I seen the stars in the afternoon\nFloatin' at night when you can catch me right under the moon"
