  "lyrics": "The current is strong from what I've heard\nIt'll whisk you down the stream\nBut I never seem to have the time\nSo my toes just touch the water\nMy toes just touch the water\nDaydreamed on the bank again\nI was swimming with the fish\nAnd I thought this time that it may be true\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nWalked a mile just to find the edge\nSome place low enough to step right in\nNow I'm here and I can't begin to move\nWalked a mile just to find the edge\nSome place low enough to step right in\nNow I'm here and I can't begin to move\nThe spoiled sun up over there\nIt always has to have its way\nAnd I know that the river's there to shelter me\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water\nMy toes just touched the water"
