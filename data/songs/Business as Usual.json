  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLook at the weather, look at the news\nLook at all the people in denial\nWe're running time, leaving grace\nStill we worship at the marketplace\nWhile common sense is going out of style\nI thought that I would be above it all by now\nIn some country garden in the shade\n[Chorus]\nBut it's business as usual\nDay after day\nBusiness as usual\nJust grinding away\nYou try to be righteous\nYou try to do good\nBut business as usual\nTurns your heart into wood\n[Verse 2]\nMonuments to arrogance reach for the sky\nOur better nature's buried in the rubble\nWe got the prettiest White House that money can buy\nSitting up there in that beltway bubble\nThe main jefe talks about our freedom\nBut this is what he really means\n\n[Chorus]\nBusiness as usual\nHow dirty we play\nBusiness as usual\nDon't you get in the way\nYeah, make you feel helpless\nMake you feel like a clown\nBusiness as usual\nIs breaking me down\n[Verse 3]\nBoy, you can't go surfing in Century City\nYeah, them sharks out there are lurking beneath the curb\nYeah, they rob you blind, chew you up, and it ain't pretty\nAnd it's a soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking\nSoul sucking, soul sucking world\n[Chorus]\nBusiness as usual\nDay after day\nBusiness as usual\nFeel like walking away\nA barrel of monkeys\nOr band of renown\nBusiness as usual\nIs breaking me down[x2]"
