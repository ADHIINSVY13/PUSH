  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Zella Day]\nI slept last night in a good hotel\nI went shoppin' today for jewels\nThe wind rushed around in the dirty town\nAnd the children let out from their school\nI was standin' on a noisy corner\nWaitin' for the walkin' green\nAcross the street, he stood\nAnd he played real good\nOn his clarinet for free\n[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]\nNow me, I play for fortunes\nAnd those velvet curtain calls\nI've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen\nWho escort me through these halls\nAnd I'll play if you've got the money\nOr if you're a friend to me\nBut the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand\nHe's been playin' real good for free\n[Verse 3: Weyes Blood]\nNobody stopped to hеar him\nThough he played so sweet and high\nThey knew he had never been on the TV\nSo they passed his music by\nI meant to go over and ask for a song\nMaybe put on a harmony\nI heard his refrain as the signal changed\nHe was playin' real good for free"
