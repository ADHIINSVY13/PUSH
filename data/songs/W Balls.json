Nuts\nAye, don't forget about my homeboy EZ Dicc and the Jackoff Hour\nThat's happening at twelve o'clock tonight\nRight now we got some new Snoop Doggy Dogg for that ass\nThis one is called \"Tha Shiznit\"\nYou're about to go downtown bitch\nRight here on the station that plays only platinum hits\nThat's 187.4 on your FM dial\nIf you're licking, that's W Balls\n(Radio Static)\nEverybody's got to hear the shit, on W Balls, W Balls, W Balls"
