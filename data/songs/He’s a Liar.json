  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI was stood by the light as I looked through your window\nWith the greatest intention not meaning to see\nI was there in the dark and I saw you together\nYou were up in his arms, I was down on my knees\nGet the cards on the table\nNo need to pretend\nYou've got to be cruel to be kind\nHe can sell you his love and you know, you will pay but\n[Chorus]\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nLiar\nHe's a liar, and I should know, ahh!\n[Verse 2]\nWell, they told me I fell but I just don't remember\nI was standing face down, they were there at my feet\nThere was smoke in the air and the sweet smell of leather\nI was through the window and down in the street\nWell, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive\nAnd it's not how I want it to be\nThere's a hand on my shoulder\nHe said I'll survive but\n\n[Chorus]\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know, ahh!\n[Release]\nWas it not for the man that was blocking the drive\nWas it not for the red limousine\nI'd be millions of miles from the scene of the crime\nAnd somehow in this madness believe she was mine but\n[Chorus]\nI'm a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nLiar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\n[Outro]\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nHe's a liar\nHe's a liar, and I should know!\nHe's a liar..."
