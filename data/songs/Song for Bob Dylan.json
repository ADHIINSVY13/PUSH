  "lyrics": "One of the semi-sketches on Hunky Dory, “Song For Bob Dylan” offers David Bowie the opportunity to engage with a towering music icon (and partial inspiration): Bob Dylan.\n[Intro]\n[Verse 1]\nAh, hear this, Robert Zimmerman\nI wrote a song for you\nAbout a strange young man called Dylan\nWith a voice like sand and glue\nSome words had truthful vengeance\nThey could pin us to the floor\nBrought a few more people on\nAnd put the fear in a whole lot more\n[Chorus]\nAh, here she comes, here she comes, here she comes again\nThe same old painted lady from the brow of the superbrain\nShe'll scratch this world to pieces as she comes on like a friend\nBut a couple of songs from your old scrapbook could send her home again\n[Verse 2]\nYou gave your heart to every bedsit room\nAt least a picture on the wall\nAnd you sat behind a million pair of eyes\nAnd told them how they saw\nThen we lost your train of thought\nThe paintings are all your own\nWhile troubles are rising, we'd rather be scared\nTogether than alone\n\n[Chorus]\nAh, here she comes, here she comes, here she comes again\nThe same old painted lady from the brow of the superbrain\nShe'll scratch this world to pieces as she comes on like a friend\nBut a couple of songs from your old scrapbook could send her home again\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n[Verse 3]\nNow, hear this, Robert Zimmerman\nThough I don't suppose we'll meet\nAsk your good friend Dylan\nIf he'd gaze a while down the old street\nTell him we've lost his poems\nSo we're writing on the walls\nGive us back our unity\nGive us back our family\nYou're every nation's refugee\nDon't leave us with their sanity\n[Chorus]\nAh, here she comes, here she comes, here she comes again\nThe same old painted lady from the brow of the superbrain\nShe'll scratch this world to pieces as she comes on like a friend\nBut a couple of songs from your old scrapbook could send her home again\n\n[Outro]\nAh, a couple of songs from your old scrapbook could send her home again\nOh, here she comes\nOoh, here she comes\nOh, here she comes\nOoh"
