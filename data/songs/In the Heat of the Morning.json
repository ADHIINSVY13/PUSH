  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize\nEvery man who looks your way\nI'll watch them sink before your gaze\nSe√±orita sway\nDance with me before their frozen eyes\nI'm so much in love like a ragged soldier\nCatching butterflies\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNo man loved like I love you\nWouldn't you like to love me too?\n[Chorus]\nIn the heat of the morning\nIn the shadows I'll clip your wings\nAnd I'll tell you I love you\nIn the heat of the morning\n[Verse 2]\nI'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze\nLight my candle from the sun\nI'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these\nI'll prove that it can be done\nOh I'm so much in love like the little boy\nWho races with the wind\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNo man loved like I love you\nWouldn't you like to love me too?\n[Chorus]\nIn the heat of the morning\nIn the shadows I'll clip your wings\nAnd I'll tell you I love you\nIn the heat of the morning"
