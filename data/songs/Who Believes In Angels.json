Would I fall on the same knife?\nA rodeo queen breathing fire into the night\nI have been there\nMan, I've been there\n[Pre-Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John, \nBrandi Carlile\n]\nWhat do you say we set the pleasantries aside?\nEven the diamonds look like rocks to the untrainеd eye\nWhat does it cost to buy your soul back whеn you die?\nWhat are the angels gonna do with you and\n I?\n[Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John]\nI\nWhat do the angels do with you and I?\nBlame the end of days\nMercury in retrograde\nWho believes in angels anyway?\n\n[Verse 3: Brandi Carlile & Elton John]\nThe color of the lie is white\nI would die on that hill in a one-handed fight\nIf you're not swingin' first you were never in the right\nI have been there\nMan, I've been there\n[Pre-Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John, \nBrandi Carlile\n]\nWhat do you say we set the pleasantries aside?\nEven the diamonds look like rocks to the untrained eye\nWhat does it cost to buy your soul back when you die?\nWhat are the angels gonna do with you and\n I?\n[Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John, \nElton John\n]\nI\nWhat do the angels do with you and I?\nBlame the end of days\nMercury in retrograde\nWho believes in angels anyway? (\nOh, no\n)\nBlame the end of days\nMercury in retrograde\nWho believes in angels anyway?\n[Verse 4: Brandi Carlile, \nBrandi Carlile & Elton John\n]\nThere's no need to curse the stars\nOr bite before you bark\nBut when \nyou need someone to walk with in the dark\nI have been there\nI have been there\n\n[Outro: Brandi Carlile, \nElton John\n, \nBoth\n]\nI have been there\nI have been there\nMan, I've been there\nWoah, yeah, been there\nI've been there\nMan, I've been there\nI’ve been there\nI've been there\nI"
