The skit that began in “Fuck Your Ethnicity” picks up from “Chapter Six”.\n[Intro: JaVonté]\nIn time, you'll learn this is about you\nIn time, you'll learn this is about you\nIn time, you'll learn this is about you\n[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]\nBabies from '80s don't know, know no better\nDon't nothing go better with ignorance but the belligerent kids that we living with\nSome of them masculine, some of them feminine\n'Member the universe used to be innocent?\nNow they just look at us crazy like immigrants\nEvery day that I wake up, I'ma sin again\nI'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80\n[Outro]\nShow of hands, how many been taking notes?\nGood\nLeave everything on the table now\nVulnerability\nThis is your generation\nShow, show your pain"
