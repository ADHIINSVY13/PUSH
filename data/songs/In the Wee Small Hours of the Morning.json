  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nIn the wee small hours of the morning\nWhile the whole wide world is fast asleep\nYou lie awake and think about the girl\nAnd never, ever think of counting sheep\n[Chorus]\nWhen your lonely heart has learned its lesson\nYou'd be hers if only she would call\nIn the wee small hours of the morning\nThat's the time you miss her most of all\n[Interlude]\n[Chorus]\nWhen your lonely heart has learned its lesson\nYou'd be hers if only she would call\nIn the wee small hours of the morning\nThat's the time you miss her most of all"
