  "lyrics": "The more I learn, the more I see\nThe less the world impassions me\nThe hungry heart, the roving eye\nHave come to rest, do not apply\nThe frantic chase, the crazy ride\nThe thrill has gone, I step aside\nAnd I'd believe in anything were it not for you\nShowing me by just existing only this is true\nI love you, I love you without question, I love you\nThe more I want the more I steal\nThe more I hold the less is real\nAll worldly things I follow blind\nIn hope not faith was paid in kind\nThe line is drawn, the change is made\nI come to you, I'm not afraid\nAnd I'd believe in anything were it not for you\nShowing me by just existing only this is true\nI love you, I love you without question, I love you\nI'd believe in anything were it not for you\nShowing me by just existing only this is true\nI love you, I love you without question, I love you"
