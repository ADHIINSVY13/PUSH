  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBorn to open for\nMankind nature's door\nA life known by a few\nAnd those who knew that shared\nTheir knowledge fewer cared\nAbout what plants could do\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFor most felt it was mad to conceive\nThat plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we\nBut with instruments Bose would devise\nWould take science itself by a surprise, so\n[Chorus]\nOn we go to where who knows\nTo a place where there's still non-believers\nWhat will it take for heaven's sake\nFor those who find what's real too hard to believe in?\nIt's that same old story again\n[Verse 2]\nBorn of slaves who died\nToo soon to realize\nThe need his life would be\nSelflessly he gave\nHis wisdom to a way\nWhere first no minds would see\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHe said if farm land was to be rich\nWe must plant crops to replenish it\nBut it took him persuasion and tests\nTo convince them Carver's way was best, so\n[Chorus]\nOn we go to where who knows\nTo a place where there's still non-believers\nWhat will it take for heaven's sake\nFor those who find what's real too hard to believe in?\nIt's that same old story again"
