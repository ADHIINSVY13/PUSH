  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe painted faces congregate\nIn the mating season\nTo second homes, they go alone\nIn no rush to leave them\n[Chorus]\nAnd there's a fountain and a scimitar\nShaped yellow light\nAnd it picks you up\nAnd cuts you down to size\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the people there and the furniture\nStart to seem important\nWhen a moment more, when you catch the floor\nWith a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc\n[Chorus]\nLike the scimitar\nShaped yellow light\nThat picks you up\nAnd cuts you down to size\n[Bridge]\nWell, I had questions for the tap dancer sat on my lap\nAnd she had child-proof caps on her answers\nStone blower, blow me a stone\nAnd show me that handsome enhancer\nShe had a rock on her throttle\nAnd a brown glass bottle full of shavings from the sun\nAlthough those shoes affect your step\nDon't forget whose legs you're on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd there's a fountain and a scimitar\nShaped yellow light\nAnd it picks you up\nAnd it cuts you down to size\n[Instrumental Outro]"
