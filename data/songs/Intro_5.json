(We're bouncing!)\nBounce. Bounce. (We're bouncing!)\nTwo times: bounce, bounce. (We're bouncing!)\nWe're bouncing. (We're bouncing!)\nBounce. (We're bouncing, baby!)\n(We're bouncing!) Come on, bounce\n(Bouncing! Bounce, baby) Bounce!\nBounce, bounce. (Hey, baby!) Bounce, bounce\n(Let's bounce) Come on, bounce. (Everybody let's bounce)\n(Let's bounce) We bouncing now\n[Big Boi]\nAll that bouncing... (Phsh)\nNiggas ain't even from the A-Town\nWe got Bankhead right here, southwest Atlanta too strong\n\n(Break!)"
