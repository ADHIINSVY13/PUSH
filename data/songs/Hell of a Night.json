  "lyrics": "[Part I]\n[Verse 1]\nOur first kiss in the livin' room\nThat's a hella way to end the night\nA hella way to end the night\nWe did drugs in the bedroom\nThat's a hella way to end the night\nA hella way to end the night\nBut she caught me fuckin' in the bathroom\nRubbers all over the bathroom\nThat's a hella way to end the night\nTonight, tonight\n[Part II]\n[Chorus]\nI left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth\nThought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead\n[Verse 2]\nIt's a hell of a night for Heaven's sakes\nAll you see is mountain and clouds, can't hit the brakes\nShe hit me twice in the face, there go' the base\nShe like to lift her nylon skirt to show the lace\nShe say she love me, but don't know what love is\nI lost love, 'cause my daddy said it, but ain't ever done shit\nPain is love and love is hell, uh\nI might need some bail if this shit don't sell\nHand on my dick while I'm coastin' up the Fiji\nSlow motionin' through emotion, tint in case a nigga see me\nThey'll come and feed you, but that felt a little easy\nI brought the squeegee in case it get a little greasy\nAfter a moment I fell into the mist\nShe reminisce a nigga style, God damn, a nigga rich\nWine and cigarettes under a light\nSaid she lost that angel done turned into a hell of a night (Night)\n\n[Chorus]\nI left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth\nThought I was in over my head, all my niggas is dead\n[Outro: K. Roosevelt]\nOh, it's a hell of a night\nIt's a hell of a night"
