  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI made them laugh, I made them cry\nBut now the rain clouds all on the inside\nThey don't know how it feels to know how I feel\nI try to escape from everything that is real\n[Chorus 1]\nHide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation\nNever out of time, somewhere in my mind\nThere's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing\nDay by day creating in my imagination\n[Verse 2]\nThe well has run dry of all my ideas\nSilence so loud, have to cover my ears\nI'm closing the door, it's hurting too much\nI'm runnIng away from everything I can touch\n[Chorus 2]\nTo hide in my imagination, there is always magic waiting\nNever counting time, always on my mind\nThere's a place that only I see, far away from all that I see\nInch by inch creating, in my imagination\n[Verse 3]\nI can stop it all from hurting\nWith this mind, I can stop the world from turning\nDon't know how it feels to know how I feel\nI try to escape from everything that is real\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI can hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation\nNever out of time, somewhere in my mind\nThere's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing\nDay by day creating in my imagination"
