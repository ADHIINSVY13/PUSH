  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe met upon a hill\nThe night was cool and still\nShe sucked my dormant will\nMother, she blew my brain\nI will go back again\nMy God, she shook me cold\n[Verse 2]\nI had no time to spare\nI grabbed her golden hair\nAnd threw her to the ground\nFather, she caved my head\nOh Lord, the things she said\nMy God, she should be told\n[Bridge]\nI was very smart\nBroke the gentle hearts\nOf many young virgins\nI was quick on the ball\nLeft them so lonely\nThey'd just give up trying\nThen she took my head and\nSmashed it up\nKept my young blood rising\nCrushed me mercilessly\nKept me going around\nSo she don't know I crave her so-o-o\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 3]\nI'll give my love in vain\nTo reach that peak again\nWe met upon a hill\nMother, she blew my brain\nI will go back again\nMy God, she shook me cold"
