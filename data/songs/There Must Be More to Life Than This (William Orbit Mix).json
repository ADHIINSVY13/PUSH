  "lyrics": "[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]\nThere must be more to life than this\nThere must be more to life than this\nHow do we cope in a world without love\nMending all those broken hearts\nAnd tending to those crying faces\nThere must be more to life than this\nThere must be more than meets the eye\nWhy should it be just a case of black or white\nThere must be more to life than this\n[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]\nWhy is this world so full of hate\nPeople dying everywhere\nAnd we destroy what we create\nPeople dying for their human rights\nBut we just go on saying c'est la vie\nSo this is life?\n[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]\nThere must be more to life than killing\nA better way for us to survive\nI live in hope for a world filled with love\nAnd we can all just live in peace\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus: Both]\nThere must be more to life than this\nThere must be more to life than this\nA living hope for a world filled with love\nThere must be more to life than this\nThere must be more to life, much more to life\nThere must be more to life, more to life than this"
