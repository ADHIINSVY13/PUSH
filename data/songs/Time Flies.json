All the niggas 'round me ride or they die\nGotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by\nToo turnt, baby girl, you know me\n[Verse 1]\nI just caught a shawty off a finsta\nJust threw on a hoodie, it's a Crenshaw\nWay that I been livin' unconventional\nI'm just tryna make it to the end, ya know\nCertain things just started gettin' tenser\nThink we need to have us an adventure\nI could be your man but maybe down the road\nRight now I would rather see my heart turn to chrome\nRather see my heart turn crystal\nI can't even front like I don't miss ya\nRight now I'm just stuck inside the crib on my own\nSoon as I free up, I'm 'bout to pop up on your phone like\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm outside in an AMG\nRight outside, TT\nToo turnt, baby girl, you know me, yeah\nWho am I? All the niggas 'round me ride or they die\nGotta watch the time 'cause it's flyin' right by\nToo turnt, baby girl, you know me\nYeah\n[Verse 2]\nHeart's still on javelin, baby\nToo turnt, baby girl, you know me\nI was pullin' off 'fore they knew me\nSometimes I wish there was two of me or three of me\nWhen it was you and me\nI felt like I love you too much to change you\nYou believe in angles more than angels\nFeel like I've been going through too much to explain to you\nBut I'm still the same way I was when I came to you\nEverything I have, what I had to exchange for you\nEverything I've been through, I can't even complain to you\nWish it stayed the same for you, sorry\nI'm sorry\n[Outro]\nAnd-and-and-and—\nI'm outside in a—\nI'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)\nI'm outside in a—\nI'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)\nI'm outside in a—\nAnd-and-and-and I'm outside in a—\nI'm-I'm-I'm-I'm— (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm—)\nI'm outside in a—\nWoi-oi, woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi-woi-oi"
