  "lyrics": "Girl I know I been busy didn't get to talk\nBut don't let your head play them games with your heart\nIt's been a little crazy doing what I do\nBut I just can't wait to get up with you\nI know it's been hard, me not being there\nBaby I don't want you thinking that I really don't care\nAnd I know that you're feeling like I'm being unfair\nBut your love is with me everywhere\nWhen I dream I think of you, breathe I think of you\nAll day I think of you give all my love to you and only you\nSwear it's true, all I do is think of you\nWhen I pray I think of you, far away I think of you\nAll day I think of you, my heart belongs to you and only you\nYes it's true, all I do is think of you\nAlways say I love you before I go to sleep\nIf I die before I wake then I'll take your love with me\nEvery second I'm away from you feels like misery\nCause I know where I really wanna be\nI know it's been hard, me not being there\nBaby I don't want you thinking that I really don't care\nAnd I know that you're feeling like I'm being unfair\nBut your love is with me everywhere\nWhat do you do when you love someone so much\nYou'd do almost anything just for one touch\nTry to make an excuse just to get away\nThat's the way that I feel about you baby\nWhen I leave do you know what I go through\nIt makes me cry every time cause I miss you\nAnd I hope you feel the same way too\nCause all I do is think of you"
