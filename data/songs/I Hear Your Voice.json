  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSo many nights\nThought that I was doing fine\nThought that time had chased your picture from my mind\nSo many times\nThought my heart was finally strong\nNow I find this heart of mine was so wrong\nI thought I'd finally learned to get on with my life\nThen it all comes back\n[Chorus]\nI hear your voice (call)\nYour voice (call) x2\nThe way it used to do\nI feel\nMy heart (fall) x2\nI try to keep you off my mind\nBut every time I do, I hear your voice\n[Verse 2]\nSo many days\nI thought that I could love again\nBut any fool in love would know that's all pretend\nYou always seem to find your way\nBack in my dreams and I can't break free\n\n[Chorus]\nI hear your voice (call)\nYour voice (call) x2\nThe way it used to do\nI feel\nMy heart (fall) x2\nI try to keep you off my mind\nBut every time I do, I hear your voice\n[Bridge]\nYou know I tried so many times just to forget you\nI've tried to walk away from you\nOh girl, it's just no use\n[Chorus]\nI hear your voice (call)\nYour voice (call)\nYour voice (call)\nCalling me.. calling me the way\nI feel my heart (fall)\nI try to keep you off my mind\nBut every time I do\n[Outro][3x]\nI hear your voice"
