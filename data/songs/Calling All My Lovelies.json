Playa hatin'?\nIf this is how it's gonna be\n[Chorus]\nI'm callin' all my lovelies (Callin' all my lovelies)\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nSince you ain't thinkin' of me (Since you ain't thinkin' of me)\nOh, look what you're makin' me do\n[Verse 2]\nHoney pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby\nSendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell? (What the hell?)\nOoh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games\nI don't get down like that, tell me where you're at, hit me back\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMmm, I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'\nAll the -eeshas waitin' on me\nSo why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?\nIf this is how it's gonna be\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm callin' all my lovelies (Callin' all my lovelies)\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nSince you ain't thinkin' of me (Since you ain't thinkin' of me)\nOh\n, look what you're makin' me do\n[Post-Chorus]\nPick up the phone, pick up the phone\n'Cause all this lovin' needs a home, oh, yeah\n[Bridge]\nOh, no, look at what you started, baby\nNow, I'm left here brokenhearted, baby\nThere's a pain in my chest, I cannot explain\nI told myself I wasn't gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry, no, no)\nBut somebody's gotta come dry these eyes 'cause (Dry these eyes)\n[Interlude]\nHi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now\nBut if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you, mwah\nDamn\n[Chorus]\nI'm callin', callin', callin', callin' all my lovelies\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nOh, since you ain't thinkin' of me (Since you ain't thinkin' of me, baby)\nLook what you're makin' me do\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nPick up the phone, pick up the phone\n'Cause all this lovin' needs a home, oh"
