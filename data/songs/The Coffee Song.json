  "lyrics": "Way down among Brazilians\nCoffee beans grow by the billions\nSo they've got to find those extra cups to fill\nThey've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil\nYou can't get cherry soda\nCause they've got to fill that quota\nAnd the way things are I'll bet they never will\nThey've got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil\nNo tea or tomato juice\nYou'll see no potato juice\nThe planters down in Santos all say no no no\nThe politician's daughter\nWas accused of drinking water\nAnd was fined a great big fifty dollar bill\nThey've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil\nYou date a girl and find out later\nShe smells just like a percolator\nHer perfume was made right on the grill\nWhy they could percolate the ocean in Brazil\nAnd when their ham and eggs need savor\nCoffee ketchup gives 'em flavor\nCoffee pickles way outsell the dill\nWhy they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil\n\nNo tea or tomato juice\nYou'll see no potato juice\nThe planters down in Santos all say no no no\nSo your lead to the local color\nServing coffee with a cruller\nDunking doesn't take a lot of skill\nThey've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil"
