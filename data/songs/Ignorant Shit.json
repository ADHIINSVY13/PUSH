No\nThe next leader of the whole free world\nAnd the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel—go!\n\n[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]\nUgh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate\nIt's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate\nThe '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig' so rude\nTell a trick, \"Get these nuts, eat dick like food\"\nNow see if I care if this verse get aired\nEven if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah\nI'm so raunchy, bitch, get off me\nKeep my flea collar on, you little ticks get off me\n[Verse 4: Jay-Z]\nI missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout Imus\nWhat do my lyrics got to do with this shit?\n'Scarface'\n the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me\nStill, that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me\nAre you saying what I'm spittin'\nIs worse than these celebutantes showin' they kitten? You kiddin'?!\nLet's stop the bullshittin'\n'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'\n'Scarface'\n the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me\nStill, that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me\nLet's stop the bullshittin'\n'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nThis is that ignorant shit you like\nNigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon\nI got that ignorant shit you love\nNigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon\nI got that ignorant shit you need\nNigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon\nI'm only tryna give you what you want\nNigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it—don't front!\n\n[Outro: Jay-Z]\nIt's only entertainment! Heh heh heh"
