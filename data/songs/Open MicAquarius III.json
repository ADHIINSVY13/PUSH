come in on Monday nights\nYou're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen\nGive it to Mr. Hall\n[Verse 1]\nRip out my soul from the depths of my flesh\nFlesh from my blood I caress\nRight on the page so it's fresh\nI take my time, but express\nLot on my mind, but I guess\nIt's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene\nKick in the door, we blow it off the hinge\nMusic my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe\nIt's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend\nTherapist tell me I don't need to defend\nTherapy tell me I don't need to explain\nJust drop the record on the needle and express my pain\nCan't wait until my son shine and together we reign\nMy queen's by my side like Manhattan\nFuck rapping, this is poetic conviction\nMy rendition is not meant for your diction\nBattled addiction in the womb\nA crack baby by definition\nKeys to ignition with no permission\nThat mean that I'm driven\nAlive 'cause I'm living\nFuck workin' with what you've been given\nI knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five\nAnd I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did\n'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did\nDidn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid\nAll I knew was alcoholism and prison\nOnly saw domestic violence and racial division\nSocial worker trying to take me away\nBut I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way\nAt least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay\nAdapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay\n\n[Interlude]\nKeep that one just in case, yeah\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just an entity\nMy DNA, not my identity\nFinding serenity\nBecome a better man, I better be\nFor the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy\nWe get big bread\nTryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead\nI'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead\nI'm trying to get ahead like a fetus\nMoney don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression\nBeing rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing\nWasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson\nWhat's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing\n[Verse 3]\nLive it, live it\nLiving life like this is so crazy\nHip-hop is amazing\nOne day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em\nGoddamn, what I'm facing\nEvery day a new frustration\nPeople thinking I'm complacent\nPeople thinking that I changed like a cashier\nBut I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here\nBuy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere\nI can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme\nGive it up, you're out of time\nNever even had a prime\nLike the Preemo never linked up with 5'9\"\nBitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae\nOkay, fuck what you gotta say\nI keep it going, already know when I'm flowing\nFor the listener, you're kind of like a therapist\nOr rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus\nThat throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit\nFuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit\n'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him\n'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose\nWrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues\nWord to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy\nLife can hit you harder than Drago\nBut if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me\nNever top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky\nOkay, well, maybe sometimes\nOccasionally in some rhymes\nBut it's fine, in due time\nI'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it\nAn indigenous era of the indigenous emcee\nRiding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E\nWhat's up?\n\n[Interlude]\n(You-you-you-you-you)\n(You-you), yeah, uh\nYeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)\nUh, uh, yeah, yeah\n(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)\nUh, yeah\nUh, yeah\n(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)\n[Verse 4]\nFuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside\nI wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride\nReflecting on memories from my childhood\nBringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good\nAll I ever gave a fuck about was my career\nBut all that shit out the window now that my son is here\nFuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams\nFuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less\nIf it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less\nI remember window shopping\nNow I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room\nBobby coming soon\nAnd that's the type of line I would've second-guessed\nPutting on my shit before\nOut of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate\n'Cause it wasn't relevant\nGive a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence\nI'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me\nYou could tear me apart\nBut that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart\nWhere it's built from the start\nWhere it's finna stay\nI've learned every day's a good day\nSurrounded by people that love me\nDon't want nothing from me but my happiness\nOff the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest\nScrolling so much, my thumb fucked up\nWe call that carpal tunnel vision\nFollow me like religion on this course of collision\nFeeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics\nAs I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis\nAll this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus\nI think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas"
