  "lyrics": "[\nVerse 1\n]\nYou were the freak king of the piercing shop\nAll the girls thought they could sing\nBut they're really not shit\n, I don't get it\nYou're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby\nHow the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy\nI don't get it, your taste once exquisite\n[Chorus]\nWhat happened to Brooklyn?\nWhat happened to New York?\nWhat happened to my scene?\nWhat happened to punk rock, rock?\n[Verse 2]\nYou called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe\nHow the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me?\nI don't get it, I'm so legit\n[Chorus 2]\nTell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels?\nThat perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool\nKid, was that it?\n[Bridge]\nStefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million\nWish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg\nYou're hurt, I know my words don't hurt ya\n\n[Breakdown]\nOh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls\nThinking that you’re number one\nYou’re so funny, 'cause honey, you're not\n[Chorus 3]\nWhat happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?\nThey said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here\nBut where?\nNo magic in the air\n[Chorus 4]\nWhat happened to Brooklyn?\nWhat happened to our scene, baby?\nHave we all gone Gaga crazy?\nRemember when the streets used to be dangerous\nAnd we were born bad?\nAnd we were born bad?\n[Outro]\nPunk rock, punk rock\nThe boys used to punch each other in the face\nAnd girls were walking 'round wasted\nEveryone had a good night, come back in sunlight\nPunk rock, rock, rock"
