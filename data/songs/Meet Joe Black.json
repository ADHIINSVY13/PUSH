  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhy would I ever have to cop a chain again\nWhen the QB chain birthed most the chains in the game?\nNo post office was stampin' time\nTook out a slice out of the Big Apple, made apple pies, family sized\nLeather bombers and Nike Sacais\nDangerous corners, you better pray that tomorrow arrives\nRap Sugar Ray Robinson, nothin' sweet\nY'all too out of shape to even box with me\nHeavyweight, I know my way around the ring\nJust like shawty know her way around the store\nMakin' hits with Hit-Boy, all he gotta do is hit record\nRecord breakin' news, had to show up just to fill a void\nConfused spoiler, oh, boys, y'all better keep your poise\nLeave me out of the weasel shit\nBe cool when you see me, I'm higher than all that rap diva shit\nThe hood know you pussy so we don't buy or believe in it\nLocked in on the instrumental, I took back the key to this, uh\n[Chorus]\nRun me the keys, \nrun me the Bs\n, run me that flow back\nYour top three, I'm not number one, how could you post that?\nI wear the crown, the city is mine, you cannot hold that\nI'm not the one to go at, you fuck around, meet Joe Black\nRun me the keys, run me the Bs, run me that flow back (What I'm sayin')\nYour top three, I'm not number one, how could you post that? (Uh)\nI wear the crown, the city is mine, you cannot hold that (Yeah)\nI'm not the one to go at, you fuck around, meet Joe Black\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat I'm sayin', people sayin' what's already been said\nPredictions, I don't listen, it's already in my head, no funny shit\nYour most hungry place, I was past that at twenty-eight\nUnderground tapes, that's my ASCAP and publishing stakes\nAs we slide in the G-ride\nI been gettin' criticized, it's keepin' me energized\nCreate with a business mind, I'm from where killers reside\nA wild hood, only knew goons since my childhood\nNiggas say anything in they raps 'cause it sound good\nDon't even mean what they say, horrible outlook\nY'all ain't really 'bout this, house nigs\nY'all was in the house with it\nWe don't respect fake jewellery and silly outfits\nWindow down, blowin' out kush\nGray tints, New York's J Prince on Houston Street\nI caught the bounce before my nigga even bounced the beat\nI took the hard way in this shit, man, it's the route for me, uh\n[Chorus]\nRun me the keys, run me the Bs, run me that flow back\nYour top three, I'm not number one, how could you post that?\nI wear the crown, the city is mine, you cannot hold that\nI'm not the one to go at, you fuck around, meet Joe Black\nRun me the keys, run me the Bs, run me that flow back\nYour top three, I'm not number one, how could you post that?\nI wear the crown, the city is mine, you cannot hold that\nI'm not the one to go at, you fuck around, meet Joe Black\n\n[Outro: Nas & \nSoulja Boy\n]\nWhy would I ever have to cop a chain again\nWhen the QB chain birthed most the chains in the game?\nWhy would I?\nFor real talk, the nigga who killed hip-hop for real is Nas, dog\nThat nigga killed hip-hop\n, \nhip-hop is dead\nThat nigga went and told everybody about it\nHe came out publicly and said, \"Hip-hop is dead\""
