  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nThe tactful cactus by your window\nSurveys the prairie of your room\nThe mobile spins to its collision\nClara puts her head between her paws\nThey've opened shops down Westside\nWill all the cacti find a home\nBut the key to the city\nIs in the sun that pins the branches to the sky"
