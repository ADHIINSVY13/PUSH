  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHey, I can see that smile on your face\nTonight\nMemories will never erase\nAnd I feel like our time has come\nOur hearts are beating wild as one\nTrue love I know is hard to find\nBut you tonight you're mine\n[Chorus]\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight\n[Verse 2]\nHey, I hope you feel the same way I feel\nCause tonight\nThe moon, the stars, this moment so real\nTo once\nWe have everything\nOur hearts have a song to sing\nWe now know that dream's come true\nCause now there's me and you\n[Chorus]\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight (I'm saying)\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight (I'm saying)\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nDidn't we dance the night away\nWhat can I say to you\nYou make life a holiday\nLet's go and play\nLet's go and play\n[Chorus]\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight (I'm saying)\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight (I'm saying)\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight\nDidn't we have the time of our life tonight\n(Come on and sing the song\nCome on and sing along)"
