  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI don't want to wake you\nBut I'd like to tell you that I love you\nThat the candlelight fell like a crescent\nUpon your feather pillow\nFor there's more ways than one\nAnd the ways of the world are a blessing\nFor when Pinky's dreaming\nShe owes the world nothing and her silence keeps us guessing\n[Chorus]\nPinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July\nQuilted and timeless, seldom denied\nThe trial and the error of my master plan\nNow she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands\n[Verse 2]\nYou don't want to tell me\nBut somehow you've guessed that I know\nOh, when dawn came this morning\nYou discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul\nFor there's toast and honey\nAnd there's breakfast in bed on a tray\nOh, it's ten below zero\nAnd we're about to abandon our plans for the day\n\n[Chorus]\nPinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July\nQuilted and timeless, seldom denied\nThe trial and the error of my master plan\nNow she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands"
