Hey babe\n[Chorus]\nYou don't know what it's like, baby\nYou don't know what it's like\nTo love somebody\nTo love somebody\nThe way I love you\n[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]\nIn my brain\nI see your face again\nI know my frame of mind\nYou ain't got to be so blind\nAnd I'm blind, so so sorrily blind\nI'm a man, can't you see\nWhat I am\nI live and I breathe for you\nBut what good does it do\nIf I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't know what it's like, baby\nYou don't know what it's like\nTo love somebody\nTo love somebody\nThe way I love you\nOooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n[Chorus: Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb]\nYou don't know what it's like, baby\nYou don't know what it's like\nTo love somebody\nTo love somebody\nThe way I love you\n(Noo noo no-no nooo nooooo)\n[Outro]\nYou don't know what it's like, baby\nYou don't know what it's like\nTo love somebody\nTo love somebody\nThe way I love you"
