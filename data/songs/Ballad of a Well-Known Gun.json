  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI pulled out my Stage Coach Times\nAnd I read the latest news\nI tapped my feet in dumb surprise\nAnd of course I saw they knew\nThe Pinkertons pulled out my bags\nAnd asked me for my name\nI stuttered out my answer\nAnd I hung my head in shame\n[Chorus]\nNow they've found me\nAt last, they've found me\nIt's hard to run\nFrom a starving family\nNow they've found me\nWell, I won't run\nI'm tired of hearing\nThere goes a well-known gun\n[Verse 2]\nNow I've seen this chain gang\nLord, I say let me see my priest\nI couldn't have faced your desert sand\nOld burning brown backed beast\nThe poor house they hit me for my kin\nAnd claimed my crumbling walls\nNow I know how Reno felt\nWhen he ran from the law\n\n[Chorus]\nNow they've found me\nAt last, they've found me\nIt's hard to run\nFrom a starving family\nNow they've found me\nWell, I won't run\nI'm tired of hearing\nThere goes a well-known gun\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nNow they've found me\nLord I say at last they've found me\nIt's hard to run\nFrom a starving family\nLord, I say now they've found me\nWell, I won't run\nI'm tired of hearing\nThere goes a well-known gun\n[Chorus]\nLord, I say, now they've found me\nAt last they've found me\nIt's hard to run\nFrom a starving family\nNow they've found me\nAnd I won't run\nI'm tired of hearing\nThere goes a well-known gun"
