  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen the lights are down\nAnd the stage is bare\nAnd no more magic's in the air\nThere's not a friend in sight to care\nYour tears no one will share\n[Chorus]\nI'll be your comfort through your pain\nI'll be your shelter in the rain\n[Verse 2]\nWhen your sad is bad and your bad is worst\nAnd there's no who to turn to first\nWhen you've done everything you can\nNo one's there to take your hand\n[Chorus]\n[Verse 3]\nWhen you've looked around\nAnd haven't seen me anywhere\nThough when you were down\nI lifted you up from there\nThere isn't a thing you can ask of me\nI won't do\nJust you put your trust in me\nMy love will see you through\nWhen the final candle's flickered out\n\"Why me\" is all you can think about\nWhen all your joy has disappeared\nYour future isn't clear\n\n[Chorus]\n[Outro]\nWhen all the odds say there's no chance\nAmidst the final dance\nI'll be you comfort through your pain\nI'll be your shelter in the rain\nI'll be you comfort through your pain\nYes, i'll be your shelter in the rain, rain\nI'll be your shelter\nBe your shelter, be your shelter in the rain"
