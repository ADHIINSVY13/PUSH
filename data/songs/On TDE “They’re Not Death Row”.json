  "lyrics": "No, they're not the new Death Row\nBecause TDE did it completely different than Death Row did it.\n \nDeath Row did it with a gangster approach. We...we were smashin on niggas, we was fuckin people up.\n \nWe was..determined to be the hardest, meanest, baddest, coldest, roughest toughest in the game. That was our mission\n. \nUhh..TDE. Rappers. They're peaceful, they love, they get down. They got rappers from everywhere and they represent hip-hop and they don't represent negativity and violence.\n And tryin to mash and disrespect it. So it's like, that how Death row came.. \nWe came out disrespectin' Eazy E and anyone who had a problem with Dr. Dre.\nThat was our first get down. It was \"fuck dem niggas up first\". That's not TDE mentality. Their mentality is cool with everybody.\n \nKendrick Lamar flipped out on everybody.\n \nThat's that Death Row influence, that may have cause him to backslide and\n \nfeel a certain way\n. \nWhich I support fully and his thoughts in what he said...Cause I'm from the West Coast, fuck errbody who got a problem with it.\nBut I don't feel like TDE and Death Row are the same thing in any way. I feel like Death Row paved the way for TDE...To do it in their own way... So they can stay around 20 years from now.\nCan ya dig that?"
