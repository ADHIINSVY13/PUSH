Let's all get on down\n (Let's dance)\nDo-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' round\n (Let's sing)\nDon't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout\n (Join hands)\nLet your hair down and square dance with me\n (Be free)\nCome on now! Let's all get on down!\n (Let's chill)\nDo-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' round\n (Let's live)\nDon't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout\n (And dance)\nLet your hair down and square dance with me!\n (With me)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nYeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back (Boo!)\nThe boogie monster of rap, yeah, the man's back\nWith a plan to ambush this Bush administration\nMush the Senate's face and push this generation\nOf kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'\nYou might not like, \nthis white hot light\nThat I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt\nOh no, I won't leave no stone unturned\nOh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere\nDo-si-do,\n oh, yo, ho, hello there!\nOh yeah, don't think I won't go there\nGo to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)\nYeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted\nWhile you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen\n'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin\nInside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'\nOpen the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'\nFuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'\nAll this terror, America demands action\nNext thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'\nTo join the army or what you'll do for their Navy\nYou just a baby gettin' recruited at 18\nYou're on a plane now, eatin' they food and their baked beans\nI'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me\nCrazy insane or insane crazy?\nWhen I say, \"Hussein,\" you say, \"Shady\"\nMy views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait\nArraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nCome on now!

(Woo-hoo!)\nPsychotic, hypnotic product, I got a the antibiotic\nAin't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada\nGod, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la\nOochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da,\n \nbut you gotta-gotta\nKeep movin', there's more music to make\nKeep makin' new shit, produce hits to break\nThe monotony, what's gotten into me?\nDrugs, rock and Hennessy,\n \nthug like I'm Pac, on my enemies\nOn your knees,\n got you under siege\nSomebody you would give a lung to be\nHun-ga-ry like a fuckin' younger me\nFuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free\nYeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny,\n \nI have the money\nTo have you killed by somebody who has nothin'\nI'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y\nLet's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nCome on now!
