  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe violins in our heart\nPlay the strings that we heard, we heard\nWe fight but I never thought\nWe'd let it get this bad, I confess, it's sad\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI used to think we were strong\nBut now I know I'm wrong\nNow I know I'm wrong\nTwo souls addicted to the pain\nLocked up in prison, by the shame\nOh no, I don't want your love\nI don't want your love\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna change\nAnd I don't wanna play rough\n'Cause I don't wanna be\nAnyone but me\nI don't wanna trust\nWe both have had enough\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love\n[Verse 2]\nThe poetry of our times\nLost all its rhymes, its rhymes\nWith words, not knives and like stones\nWe'd carve deep wounds in these bones\nWeak bones, my weak bones\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI used to think we were strong\nBut now I know I'm wrong\nNow I know I'm wrong\nTwo souls addicted to the pain\nLocked up in prison by the shame\nOh no, I don't want your love\nI don't want your love\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna change\nAnd I don't wanna play rough\n'Cause I don't wanna be\nAnyone but me\nI don't wanna trust\nWe both have had enough\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love\n[Bridge]\n[?] all in love\nWe can't believe [?]\nAnd oh, I wish that when you kiss me it felt\nThe way it did before the [?] hurts\nAnd heads have too much love\n\n[Outro]\nI don't want your love\nOh, I don't want your love\nNo, I don't want your love\nI don't want your love\nNo, I don't wanna be anything but happy\nYeah, I don't want your love\nI don't want it, want it\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love, your love\nI don't want your love\nI don't want your love"
