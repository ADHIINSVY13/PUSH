  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nToday I may not have a thing at all\nExcept for just a dream or two\nBut I've got lots of plans for tomorrow\nAnd all my tomorrows belong to you\n[Verse 2]\nRight now it may not seem like spring at all\nWe're drifting and the laughs are few\nBut I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow\nAnd all my tomorrows belong to you\n[Chorus]\nNo one knows better than I\nThat luck keeps passing me by\nThat's fate\nBut with you there at my side\nI'll soon be turning the tide\nJust wait\n[Verse 3]\nAs long as I've got arms that cling at all\nIt's you that I'll be clinging to\nAnd all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow\nOn some bright tomorrow\nWill all come true\n\n[Outro]\nAnd all my bright tomorrows belong to you"
