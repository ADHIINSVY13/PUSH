  "lyrics": "How I, how I\nWeep for the loss\nAnd it creeps down my chin\nFor the heart and the hair\nAnd the skin and the air\nThat swirls itself around the bare\nHow I weep\nHow I weep\nHow I weep and I sleep\nAnd I march and I dance\nAnd I sing and I laugh\nAnd I laugh and I laugh\nBut inside\nBut inside\nInside I weep\nInside I weep\nAnd I weep for a loss that's so deep\nThat it hardens and turns into stone\nThere it stays\nAnd rolls through bones\n'Til they crumble\nAnd the earth doesn't spin\nIt's got no way to win\nAnd the stars stare down with sad clown faces\nAnd they taunt me\nThey taunt me\n\nSo I run and I run, and I run and I run\nBut I've nowhere to go except into the sun\nAnd I weep for the loss and the loss weeps for me\nThe loss weeps for me\nThen it whacks me straight into my stomach at night\nIt's a hard blow to take with all of its might\nAnd it tries to be sorry, it tries to be sweet\nThen it runs out the door as if on two feet\nAnd I stand there and wonder, when will I be free?\nThen I realized I held it, it never held me\nIt had to hurt me to finally be gone\n'Cause I made the mistake of dragging it on\nAnd I wonder, what kind of person am I\nWho weeps for a loss but can't tell it goodbye?\nHow I\nHow I weep\nHow I weep\nHow I weep\nHow I\nHow I weep\nHow I weep\nHow I weep"
