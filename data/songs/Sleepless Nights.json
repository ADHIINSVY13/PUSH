  "lyrics": "Through the sleepless nights, I cry for you\nAnd wonder who is kissing you\nOh these sleepless nights will break my heart in two\nSomehow through the days, I don't give in\nI hide the tears that wait within\nOh but then through sleepless nights, I cry again\nWhy did you go?\nWhy did you go?\nDon't you know?\nDon't you know?\nI need you\nI keep hoping you'll come back to me\nOh let it be, please let it be\nOh my love, please end these sleepless nights for me\nWhy did you go?\nWhy did you go?\nDon't you know?\nDon't you know?\nI need you\nI keep hoping you'll come back to me\nOh let it be, please let it be\nOh my love, please end these sleepless nights for me\nOh my love, please end these sleepless nights for me"
