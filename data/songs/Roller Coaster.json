(Did I lose it, babe?)\n(Slow it down)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLonely overseas, only memories\nWish I had the key to your heart\nPeople come and go, baby, they don’t know\nWhat we had before, but it fell before our eyes\n[Chorus]\nRoller coaster, roller coaster\nSpinning all around and around for a while baby\nRoller coaster, roller coaster\nFor a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down\n[Verse 2]\nIt's been difficult\nI'm just happy there's no flights no more\nBut it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more\nThere's a reason what this happened for, yeah (But I can't help but feel like)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLonely overseas, only memories\nWish I had the key to your heart\nPeople come and go, baby, they don’t know\nWhat we had before, but it fell before our eyes\n[Chorus]\nRoller coaster, roller coaster\nSpinning all around and around for a while baby\nRoller coaster, roller coaster\nFor a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down\n[Bridge]\nBounce\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLonely overseas, only memories\nWish I had the key to your heart\nPeople come and go, baby, they don’t know\nWhat we had before, but it fell before our eyes\n[Chorus]\nRoller coaster, roller coaster\nSpinning all around and around for a while baby\nRoller coaster, roller coaster\nFor a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down"
