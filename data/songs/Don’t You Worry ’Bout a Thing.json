  "lyrics": "Everybody’s got to pay\nBut some don’t know how to handle it\nAlways reaching out in vain\nJust taking the things not worth having\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nMama\nCause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out\nYou say your style of life’s a drag\nAnd that you must go other places\nBut just don’t you feel too bad\nWhen you get fooled by smiling faces\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nMama\nCause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out\nWhen you get off your trip\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry bout it\n\n*scatting*\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nMama\nCause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out\nWhen you get off your trip\nEverybody needs a change\nA chance to check out the new\nBut you're the only one to see\nThe changes you take yourself through\nChorus:\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing\nPretty Mama\nCause I'll be standing on the sides when you check it out\nDon’t you worry 'bout a thing\nDon’t you worry 'bout a thing\nDon’t you worry 'bout a thing\nDon’t you worry 'bout a thing\nDon't you worry 'bout it\n\n*scatting*\nDon’t worry\nDon’t worry\nDon’t worry\nDon’t worry\nDon’t worry"
