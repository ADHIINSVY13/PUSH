  "lyrics": "[Biggie's Mom]\nLet's say there are many times I looked,\nand saw reflections of my son.\nI argued sometimes, consulted;\nI saw results, and said \"Well done.\"\nI thought of him constantly,\nand silently asked \"Why?\"\nI tried fervently,\nand just cannot say goodbye.\nI lived with visions twined and twisted,\npassion so cold,\nand withered thoughts, battered and shattered.\nI dreamed dreams.\nCherished memories.\nHoused friendship,\nand promises that mattered.\nIn the end,\ntime is treasured;\nBut love for my son?\nIt's everlasting."
