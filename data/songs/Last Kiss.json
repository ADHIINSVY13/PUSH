  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI still remember the look on your face\nLit through the darkness at 1:58\nThe words that you whispered for just us to know\nYou told me you loved me, so why did you go away?\nAway\n[Verse 2]\nI do recall now, the smell of the rain\nFresh on the pavement\n, \nI ran off the plane\nThat July ninth, the beat of your heart\nIt jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut now I'll go\nSit on the floor wearing your clothes\nAll that I know is I don't know\nHow to be something you miss\n[Chorus]\nI never thought we'd have a last kiss\nI never imagined we'd end like this\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\n[Verse 3]\nI do remember the swing of your step\nThe life of the party, you're showing off again\nAnd I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in\nI'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did\nBecause I love your handshake, meeting my father\nI love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\nHow you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something\nThere's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I'll go\nSit on the floor wearing your clothes\nAll that I know is I don't know\nHow to be something you miss\n[Chorus]\nI never thought we'd have a last kiss\nI never imagined we'd end like this\nYour name, forever the name on my lips, ooh\n[Bridge]\nSo I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep\nAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe\nAnd I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are\nHope it's nice where you are\n[Verse 4]\nAnd I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day\nAnd something reminds you you wish you had stayed\nYou can plan for a change in the weather and time\nBut I never planned on you changing your mind\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo, I'll go\nSit on the floor wearing your clothes\nAll that I know is I don't know\nHow to be something you miss\n\n[Chorus]\nI never thought we'd have a last kiss\nI never imagined we'd end like this\nYour name, forever the name on my lips\n[Outro]\nJust like our last kiss\nForever the name on my lips\nForever the name on my lips\nJust like our last"
