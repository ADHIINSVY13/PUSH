Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?\nCan I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?\nFamily gossiping, pocket watching him\nJealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (\nKing\n)\n'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing\nThat you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping\nThe stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra\nProof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh\nNostalgia, how I remembеr things\nRemember crowns, remember, kings\nThey want your reign to cease (\nKing\n)\nYou a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely\nWe're so \"Say less when I speak\", y'all estrogen speak\nRespected by kings only, address me as chief\nInvested in things only a vet would\nOnly lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps\nYou mad at my niggas and any woman with interest in me\nYou could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted\nNow you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics\nAll you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit\nYou should want every brother to make it out\nBut brothers want trophies, they troll for clout\nRap is weird, weird flex, but okay\nYou ain't as ill as you think, you just okay\nYou got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top\nStop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness\nIt's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless\nMy life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up? (Why me?)\nReal kings everywhere, stand up\nIt come with the game (\nKing’s Disease\n)"
