  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wasn't born to be alone\nThat was a lesson I was shown\nTo know that love was just a lie\nI ran away to think it over\nBut it's over and I try to take a stand on what is real\nSomeone has shown me how to feel\nI'm like a shadow in the night\nI'm like a river in an ocean\nI'm a flame without a light\n[Chorus]\nAnd now I'm cryin' every day\nAnd I've been cryin' every day\nAnd I've been thinking of your love\nI keep turnin', I keep turnin'\nI keep turnin' I keep turnin'\nWell your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray\nAnd now I'm cryin' every day\n[Bridge]\nCan there be any wonder why to be living under\nLove is a revelation only few can share\nI could be a mountain strong but the pain about you\nLong as I live without you\nI would still be there\nI wanna die, die away, never love, never cry\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I been walkin' in the rain\nAnd I been hangin' on a dream\nAll the faces and the places that our love has ever been\n[Chorus]\nAnd now I'm cryin' every day\nAnd I've been cryin' every day\nAnd I've been thinking of your love\nI keep turnin', I keep turnin'\nI keep turnin' I keep turnin'\nWell your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray\nAnd now I'm cryin' every day\n[Bridge]\nCan there be any wonder why to be living under\nLove is a revelation only few can share\nI could be a mountain strong but the pain about you\nLong as I live without you\nI would still be there\nI wanna die, die away, never love, never cry\n[Breakdown]\nI wasn't born to be a fool but I'm a fool to be around\nI'm a man without a country, I'm a King without a crown\nAnd then you're throwin' me away\nAnother world, another time\nBut if anyone belongs to anybody - you were mine\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm cryin' every day\nAnd I've been cryin' every day\nAnd I've been thinking of your love\nI keep turnin', I keep turnin'\nI keep turnin' I keep turnin'\nWell your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray\nAnd now I'm cryin' every day\n[Outro]\nI'm cryin', cryin'\nI'm cryin' every day, I've been thinking of you love..."
