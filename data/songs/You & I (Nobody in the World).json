Yeah\n[Verse 1]\nYou fix your make-up, just so\nGuess you don't know, that you're beautiful\nTry on every dress that you own\nYou were fine in my eyes a half hour ago\n[Pre-Chrous]\nAnd if your mirror won't make it any clearer\nI'll be the one to let you know\n[Chrous]\nOut of all the girls\nYou're my one and only girl\nAin't nobody in the world tonight\nAll of the stars\nYou make them shine like they were ours\nAin't nobody in the world but you and I\nYou and I\nAin't nobody in the world but you\n[Verse 2]\nYou stop the room when we walk in\nThe spotlight's on, everybody's staring\nTell all of these boys they're wasting their time\nStop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine\n\n[Pre-Chrous]\nAnd this evening I won't let the feeling die\nI never wanna leave your side\n[Chrous]\nOut of all the girls\nYou’re my one and only girl\nAin't nobody in the world tonight\nAll of the stars\nYou make them shine like they were ours\nAin't nobody in the world but you and I\nYou and I\nAin't nobody in the world\n[Bridge]\nYou keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting\nYou don't even have to try\nOh, you don't have to try\nDon't try, don't try\nYou don't have to try\n[Chrous]\nOh, out of all of the girls\nYou’re my one and only girl\nAin't nobody in the world tonight\nAll of the stars\nThey don't shine brighter than you are\nAin't nobody in the world but you and I\nYou and I\nYou and I\n\n[Outro]\nNobody in the world tonight\nAin't nobody in the world but you and I"
