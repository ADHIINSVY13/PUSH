  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLike a corn in a field I cut you down\nI threw the last punch too hard\nAfter years of going steady\nWell, I thought that it was time\nTo throw in my hand for a new set of cards\nAnd I can't take you dancing out on the weekend\nI figured we'd painted too much of this town\nAnd I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon\nAnd I knew then I had lost what should have been found\nI knew then I had lost what should have been found\n[Chorus]\nAnd I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford\nI'm low as a paid assassin is\nYou know I'm cold as a hired sword\nI'm so ashamed, can't we patch it up?\nYou know I can't think straight no more\nYou make me feel like a bullet, honey, in the gun\nIn the gun of Robert Ford\n[Verse 2]\nLike a child when his toys have been stepped on\nThat's how it all seemed to me\nI burst the bubble\nThat both of us lived in\nAnd I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel\nAnd if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man\nYour friends and mine don't call no more\nHell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded\nBreaking up's sometimes like breaking the law\nBreaking up's sometimes like breaking the law\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford\nI'm low as a paid assassin is\nYou know I'm cold as a hired sword\nI'm so ashamed, can't we patch it up?\nOh, you know I can't think straight no more\nYou make me feel like a bullet, honey, in the gun\nIn the gun of Robert Ford\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nAnd I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford\nI'm low as a paid assassin is\nYou know I'm cold as a hired sword\nI'm so ashamed, can't we patch it up?\nYeah, you know I can't think straight no more\nYou make me feel like a bullet, honey, in the gun\nIn the gun of Robert Ford"
