I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\n[Verse 2]\nAlways, I'm in some shit!\nMy abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick\nUncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me\nI bust off when they unlock me\nResults of what happens to niggas shock me\nI see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear\nStunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys\nFor years, I've been used in robberies\nGiving niggas heart to follow me\nPlacing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed\nI was laid in a shelf with a grenade\nMet a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:\nFive-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five-and-zero\nHad a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place\nWhere he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him\nTired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun\nBut yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on\nI make myself jam right in my owner's hand\n\n[Chorus]\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\n[Verse 3]\nYo, weeks went by and I'm surprised\nStill stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides\nBesides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a 9\nThere's a grenade in a box, \nand that TEC that kept crying\n'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear\nHe's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career\nYo, I can hear somebody coming in\nOpen the shelf, his eyes bubbling\nHe said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him\nShaking, somebody stomped him out, \nhis dome was aching\nHe placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting\nMy creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks\nIt's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories\nBut this time, it's done intentionally\nHe walked me outside, saw this cat\nCocked me back, said, \"Remember me?\"\nHe pulled the trigger, but I held on, it felt wrong\nKnowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him\nHe squeezed harder\n, I didn't budge, sick of the blood\nSick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge\nWhat the other kid did was pull out, no doubt\nA newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase\nMy owner fell to the floor, his wig split\nSo fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!\nHeard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming\nNow I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me\nDamn!"
