Cole]\nBelieve in God like the sun up in the sky\nScience can tell us how (But), it can't tell us why\nI seen a baby cry, then seconds later, she laughs\nThe beauty of life, the pain never lasts\nThe rain always pass, the sun don't always shine (Yeah)\nWhen it's gone, I'm lonely, but when it's there, I'm fine\nI hate the wintertime because the nights come quicker\nThe light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga\nBut at night, they think twice and walk a little faster\nIt's funny, hundred years ago, I'd have called this nigga \"Master\"\nHow the tables turn, but still the fire burnin', uh\nI feel the heat the world is a dryer turnin'\nTurnin'\n, \nI'm lookin' for some higher learnin'\nLearnin', girl, you what I desire, yearnin'\nYearnin'\n, \nyou say I'm easily distracted\nI think the problem is I'm easily attracted\nBy the dark side\n, the temptation got me questionin' where my heart lies\nI'm tryna separate myself like apartheid\n, but ayy, the liquor keep swallowin'\nI swear I walk with God, but the devil keep followin'\nFollowin', I say the devil keep followin'\nFollowin', I say the devil keep followin'\nFollowin', I say the devil keep followin'\n\n[Verse 2: Omen]\nUh, feel like I'm ridin' on a\nChartered plane of broken-hearted pain\nTurbulence is constant, my pilot has gone insane\nIf I can find a parachute to parasail\nMaybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail\nCharacter dope as hell\nBut where is my parallel sweetheart? Deep thoughts\nLost in my brain, so I sleep hard nights with no progress\nMane, I'm thinkin' like I'll probably find a Loch Ness in the projects before I find this\nObject of my love, this object of my heart\nGuitar strings is strum in search of my counterpart\nBound to start drinkin' and smokin', sink in this ocean\nLeapin' through the badness, hopin' I'm reachin' for closeness\nFeel like the devil keep followin' me\nFeel like the devil keep followin' me\nUh"
