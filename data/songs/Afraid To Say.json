(Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nDoes what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs life about climbin' up the ladder?\nAnd can we even see lives that are shattered?\n'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter\nWhat have we done with society?\nWhen everybody's getting canceled\nAnd can't there be room for maturity?\n'Cause writin' 'em off is not the answer\nDo we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, do we?)\nAre we judged for everything we say?\n (Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, are we?)\nI wanna grow, but I'm afraid (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nAnd will it always be the same? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nDoes what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs life about climbin' up the ladder\nAnd can we even see lives that are shattered?\n'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter\nWhat have we done with society?\nWhen everybody's getting canceled (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\nAnd can't there be room for maturity?\n'Cause writin' 'em off is not the answer\n\n[Interlude: Justin Bieber]\nWe can't write people off, God never writes us off\nEven in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it\nEven when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing, God never writes us off, ever\nHe's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle\nHe's with us in our bad decisions\nHe's with us all the time, He never writes us off (He never writes us off)\n[Outro: Lauren Walters & \nJustin Bieber\n]\nYou formed the whole of me (\nOoh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh\n), inward and out (\nOoh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh\n)\nI am awesomely and wonderfully created (\nOoh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh\n)\nYour creations are spectacular\nYou skillfully designed me (\nOoh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh\n), You saw the essence of me before I was formed\nBefore I existed, all of my days were written in your book Psalms 139:13-16"
