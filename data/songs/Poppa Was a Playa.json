Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\nPoppa was a playa, playa was in poppa\nPoppa loved the ladies, never got enough of\nThe pretty brown round, running round town\n\"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\n[Verse 2]\nSo many kids I knew, never knew who Pop was\nThat's why I show my pop love\n'Cause he was still around when I popped up\nHe could have left my moms pregnant – shook to death, but stayed\nWatched me crawl 'til I took my first step, to the first grade\nTo my first fistfight, right behind me, he would stand\nNo matter how big or tall, he made me fight you like a man\nThrow dirt in your eye, swing my right, scoop your ass and slam\nHe watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam\nRoaches of weed all over my crib, him and moms relaxing\nNext thing you know, he packing, so then I asked him\n\"What's this white shit on that plate and your face?\nAnd, Poppa, why you butt-ass from the waist?\nAnd, who's this lady I'm facing? Dark skin, you not my mommy!\"\nHe grabbed me up, to run some smooth words by me\nPromised me things that he would buy me\nIf I kept my mouth closed and don't tell Mommy\nHe said one day I'll understand—\n\"Little me, what's in you is inside me\"\n\n[Chorus]\nPoppa was a playa, playa was in poppa\nPoppa loved the ladies, never got enough of\nThe pretty brown round, running round town\n\"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\nPoppa was a playa, playa was in poppa\nPoppa loved the ladies, never got enough of\nThe pretty brown round, running round town (Ugh, my nigga)\n\"(Shhh!) Don't tell your mother what's going down\"\n[Verse 3]\nPops told me hold my own, Pops told me value home\nCould I help it, \"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\"?\nWho loved the pretty brown round, \nout-of-town-bound\n,\nTrumpet in his jazz band, he touring\nAt home, I played his latest recordings\nAnd it's strange how I do my thing now, I'm in the game now\nInherited his brainpower to pull strings and gain power\nOur weed habits the same now\nNo white lines, or trumpets\nJust tight rhymes and beats that's bumpin\n'Fore he left, he taught me something\nA child's young years' the most important time to be there\nThat's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here\nI'm older now, see what having a father's about\nOne day they can be in your life, next day, they be out\nIt's not because of you, you know the deal, him and your moms feel\nIf they stay together, then someone will get killed\nI love you still, always will, 'cause that's my nigga\nAlthough you felt you was wrong, I still feel you, kid\nLife goes on..."
