  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI get along without you very well, of course, I do\nExcept when soft rains fall\nAnd drip from leaves, then I recall\nThe thrill of being sheltered in your arms, of course, I do\nBut I get along without you very well\n[Verse 2]\nI've forgotten you just like I should, of course, I have\nExcept to hear your name\nOr someone's laugh that is the same\nBut I've forgotten you just like I should\n[Bridge]\nWhat a guy, what a fool am I\nTo think my breaking heart could kid the moon\nWhat's in store? Should I phone once more?\nNo, it's best that I stick to my tune\n[Verse 3]\nI get along without you very well, of course, I do\nExcept perhaps in spring\nBut I should never think of spring\nFor that would surely break my heart in two"
