  "lyrics": "How many roads must a man walk down\nBefore you call him a man?\nYes, n how many seas must a white dove sail\nBefore she sleeps in the sand?\nYes, n how many times must the cannon balls fly\nBefore theyre forever banned?\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind\nThe answer is blowin in the wind\nHow many times must a man look up\nBefore he can see the sky?\nYes, n how many ears must one man have\nBefore he can hear people cry?\nYes, n how many deaths will it take till he knows\nThat too many people have died?\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind\nThe answer is blowin in the wind\nHow many years can a mountain exist\nBefore its washed to the sea?\nYes, n how many years can some people exist\nBefore theyre allowed to be free?\nYes, n how many times can a man turn his head\nPretending he just doesnt see?\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind\nThe answer is blowin in the wind\n\nHow many times must a man look up\nBefore he can see the sky?\nYes, n how many ears must one man have\nBefore he can hear people cry?\nYes, n how many deaths will it take till he knows\nThat too many people have died?\nThe answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind\nThe answer is blowin in the wind"
