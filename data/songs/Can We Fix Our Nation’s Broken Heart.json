  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCan we fix our nation's broken heart?\nAre we brave enough to try? Mm-mm\nCan we fix our nation's broken heart\nAnd leave a better world behind?\n[Chorus]\n'Cause if we listen to different thoughts and points of views\nAll my brothers and sisters, we don't have to lose humanity\nWe're family, so can we please\nFix our nation's broken heart?\n[Verse 2]\nChildren marching down the boulevard\nTears are streaming down their face, oh-oh\nTension in the air is so bizarre\nLove has gone without a trace\n[Chorus]\nPeople pushing and shouting and fighting through the haze\nAnd all this sadness, madness, help me take away the pain, it's gotta change\nThis can't stay the same, so tell me please\nCan we fix our nation's broken heart?\n[Bridge]\nPoverty and homelessness\nCan we do away with this?\nAll we need to is to be giving\nFor our daughters and our sons\nThere's a light in everyone\nThey deserve a new beginning, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nWill the light we share survive the dark\nOr will it slowly fade away? Ah-ah\nWill the light of good be torn apart\nAnd swept away by crushing waves?\n[Chorus]\nWe've been floating alone in a dark and bitter cold\n'Cause there's a growing ocean of lies that we've been told to tear us down\nBut what I've found is with our truth, compassion, and love\nWe can fix our nation's broken heart\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 4]\nCan we fix our nation's broken heart?\nAre we brave enough to try? Hey-ey\nWe must fix our nation's broken heart\nTo leave a better world behind\n[Chorus]\nWe've come together with purpose far bigger than you and me\nDon't have no time for hatred and negativity, it's you and me\nWe hold the key, so tell me please\nCan we fix our nation's broken heart?\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nCan we fix our nation's broken heart?\nI know and you know\nWe must fix our nation's broken heart"
