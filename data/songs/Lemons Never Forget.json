  "lyrics": "Incidentally there should be some changes made\nYou've got to work if you should have to save\nAn apple is a fool but lemons never do forget\nYou've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net\nWait a while and straighten out the tie you wear\nYou've got to take it easy if you dare\nAn apple is a fool but lemons never do forget\nYou've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net\nDon't be blind, you've got a thinking mind\nStop the bells that ring so loud\nDon't nod your head, you'll draw a crowd\nJust think of everything you've worked so hard to bring\nThe lemon sings my song. He's known it all along\nIncidentally there should be some changes made\nYou've got to work if you should have to save\nAn apple is a fool but lemons never do forget\nYou've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net\nDon't be blind, you've got a thinking mind\nStop the bells that ring so loud\nDon't nod your head, you'll draw a crowd\nJust think of everything you've worked so hard to bring\nThe lemon sings my song. He's known it all along\n\nIncidentally there should be some changes made\nYou've got to work if you should have to save\nAn apple is a fool but lemons never do forget\nYou've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net"
