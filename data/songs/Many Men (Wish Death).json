(Homie)\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nEvery night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back\nI know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat\nIn my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me\nPsychic says some bitch done put a hex on me\nThe feds didn't know much when Pac got shot\nI got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked\nI ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time\nAre you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?\nIn the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around\nHommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down\nNow it's clear that I'm here for a real reason\n'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me"
