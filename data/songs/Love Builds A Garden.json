  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou hear it every day\nOnce upon a time they say\nOnce upon a time in this place\nI looked and saw on your face\nA smile that spoke to me\nIn oh so many ways\nThe Sunday morning bells\nRang out that all was well\nSunshine across the yard\nWe'd rest when we worked hard\nWe take a little time off\nTo appreciate the day\n[Chorus]\nAnd love builds a garden\nGrew it from the ground up\nEach one of us knowing\nEvery inch of it was us\nWe pulled it all together\nHoping and believing\nThat love built this garden\nFor the two of us to dream in\n[Verse 2]\nWe'd get a little rain\nThen the sun came out again\nBut a frost it's hard to fight\nOnce it takes hold flowers die\nThere's only so much you can do\nTo keep some things alive\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd love builds a garden\nGrew it from the ground up\nEach one of us knowing\nEvery inch of it was us\nWe pulled it all together\nHoping and believing\nThat love built this garden\nFor the two of us to dream in\n[Bridge]\nSad to say, it's true\nWithout a lover who\nCares as much\nWell I guess, I guess it goes to prove\n[Chorus]\nAnd love builds a garden\nGrew it from the ground up\nEach one of us knowing\nEvery inch of it was us\nWe pulled it all together\nHoping and believing\nThat love built this garden\nFor the two of you to dream in"
