  "lyrics": "Moments I make momentarily mine\nAre moments I take a step back in time\nEach step that I take is leading me to\nA time when I felt closer to you\nMoments I gain, moments I lose\nI'm just killing time trying to find\nWhat we had once has been left behind\nHere we both stand as it slips through our hands\nMoments we care a little too much\nMoments we care are never enough\nClinging to pride, our heads held high\nWhat we truly feel is pushed to the side\nMoments we gain are moments we lose\nWe're just killing time trying to find\nWhat we had once has been left behind\nYet we stand as it slips through our hands\nWe know we can\nWe can survive\nSurvive before\nThat comes be before pride\nThat comes before pride\nI'll be just killing time\nWhat we had once has been left behind\nAnd here we stand as it slips through our hands\nMoments we gain and moments we lose"
