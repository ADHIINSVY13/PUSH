  "lyrics": "He spoke a script\nDipped in the sort of talk to make you keep the gaze\nIt's all a trick\nThe slicked back slimy arms have got a war to wage\nHe's got a laugh like a crackling wire\nAnd he wants to put the bite marks on you\nHe wants to put the bite marks on you\nAnd he twists my guts\nAs the only thing that's repelling as his invitations\nAre his excuses\nAnd he said \"I am the conductor\nPut me in a terror pocket\"\nHe did a stint\nMaster in a craft\nHe'd squint through his spectacle\nHe'd drop a dirty hint if he thinks that he could impress you with the unacceptable\nAnd he has turned through all the pages with his fingers\nAnd covered them with goo\nAnd he wants to put the bite marks on you\nHe wants to put them on you and it hurts my back\nBecause the only thing that's as heavy as the adoration\nIs the days of hanging out on his lawn\nAnd he spilled without a sounding alarm\nAnd he frightened me to death\nWhen he said \"I am the conductor\nPut me in a terror pocket\""
