Lana shared the poem via Instagram on February 19th, 2019.\nYou thought I was rich\nAnd I am but not how you think\nI live in a Tudor house\nUnder the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach\nWhen you call I take my phone to the picnic table\nThat I bought from the \nRose Bowl\nAnd I listen to the rushing cars above\nAnd I think about the last time you visited me\nThe last time we made love\nHow the noise got louder and louder during rush hour\nUntil it sounded like the sea\nAnd it felt like the ocean was the sky\nAnd that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me\nUntil you took me in your arms\nAnd I could touch the stars\nAnd they all fell down around my head\nAnd I became an angel\nAnd you put me to bed\nHappy\nPeople think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think\nI have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition\nAnd on the back it says: \nhappy,  joyous, and free\nHappy\nAnd when I drive\nI think about the last time my friends were driving with me\nHow the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words\nSo we became the music\nHappy\n\nThey write that I'm rich and I am but not how they think\nI have a safe I call the boyfriend box\nAnd in it every saved receipt\nEvery movie theater ticket just to remind me\nOf all the things I've loved and lost and loved again\nUnconditionally\nHappy\nYou joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think\nI live in a Tudor house under the freeway\nOff of Rose Avenue, 12 blocks from the beach\nAnd when you call I put your sweater on\nAnd put you on speaker\nAnd chat for hours underneath the trees\nAnd think about the last time you were here lying next to me\nHow the noise from the cars got louder and louder\nDuring rush hour\nUntil it sounded like a river or a stream\nAnd it felt like we were swimming\nBut it wasn't just a dream\nWe were just\nHappy"
