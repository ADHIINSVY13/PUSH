  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards\nYou're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'\nBut I kinda know that I won't get far\nAnd you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch\nClose enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of\n[Chorus]\nDrop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\nGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n[Verse 2]\nMy mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea\nYou touch me once and it's really somethin'\nYou find I'm even better than you imagined I would be\nI'm on my guard for the rest of the world\nBut with you, I know it's no good\nAnd I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would\n[Chorus]\nDrop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\nGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n\n[Bridge]\nI run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild\nJust keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right\nAnd lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?\nI'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show\n[Chorus]\nDrop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down\nGive me something that'll haunt me when you're not around\n'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n[Outro]\nAnd the sparks fly\nOh, baby, smile\nAnd the sparks fly"
