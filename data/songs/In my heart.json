Don't wanna lose you to this sucker\n‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta\nDon't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast\nNobody knows, on who controls will it last?\nBefore I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere\nAnd even if you stay with him today I'm still here\nI refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share\nYou're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare\n‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know\nPassionately yours and I'll never let you go\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nBut in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\nThat someone's there for your struggle\nDepend on me\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nBut in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\n*Remember one thing\nThrough every dark night, there's a bright day after that*\nCould it be my destiny to be lonely?\nAin't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me\n‘Cause they phony\nBut you was different, I got no need to be suspicious\n‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious\nThe way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted\nI'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it\nEven though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it\nSlowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it\nYou blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'\nNow your heart's tooken\nMy only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook\nWanna take you there but you scared to follow\nCome see tomorrow\nHopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow\nLet you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle\nDepend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble\nI wanna give you happiness and maybe even more\nI contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nBut in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\nThat someone's there for your struggle\nDepend on me\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nBut in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\n*Thug for life... feel me?\nLearn one thing\nStay strong\nWhen things get bad\nEspecially come the first and the fifteenth\nStay strong, and stay ballin', hold on\nI'll catch y'all at the next life*\nEver since I met ya I could peep the pressure\nIt's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya\nI can see your state of misery from the introduction\nAin't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nLate night phone conversations – would that be OK?\nI don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line\nTell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind\nI can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you\nThe anticipation of love makin'\nGot you shakin' when I'm standin' near you\nNews of precision will prepare ya\nIn case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror\nNow the picture's gettin' clearer\nAll he does is hit you hard\nI tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God\nI don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home\nI contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nBut in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\nThat someone's there for your struggle\nDepend on me\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nBut in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\n-Uh, I'll catch y'all at the next life-"
