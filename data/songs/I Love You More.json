  "lyrics": "More than I love the first of spring\nI love you more\nMore than the sweetest song I sing\nI love you more\nMore than the Christmas bells that ring\nI love you more my Lord\nMore than a star filled summer's night\nI love you more\nMore awe than viewing a wondrous sight\nI love you more\nMore than the Christmas cards I write\nI love you more my Lord\nMore than the days, more than the nights\nMore than seasons and reasons for every life\nMore is my love for Jesus Christ\nAnd my God who made it all\nMore than the autumn's falling leaves\nI love you more\nMore than snowflakes dancing in the breeze\nI love you more\nMuch more than Santa and Christmas trees\nI love you more, my Lord\n\nMistletoes and everything wow\nChristmas just as I pictured it\nMistletoes and everything wow\nChampagne, Pineapple juice\nMore than the days, more than the nights\nMore than seasons and reasons for every life\nMore is my love for Jesus Christ\nAnd my God who made it all\nMore than the autumn's falling leaves\nI love you more\nMore than snowflakes dancing in the breeze\nI love you more\nMuch more than Santa and Christmas trees\nI love you more, my Lord\nWith every single breath of life you give me\nI love you more\nMore than I love the first of spring\nI love you more\nMore than the sweetest song I sing\nI love you more, Lord, I love you more"
