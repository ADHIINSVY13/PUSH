  "lyrics": "Laura is the face in the misty light\nFootsteps that you hear down the hall\nThe laugh that floats on a summer night\nThat you can never quite recall\nAnd you see Laura on a train that is passing through\nThose eyes how familiar they seem\nShe gave your very first kiss to you\nThat was Laura, but she's only a dream\nShe gave your very first kiss to you\nThat was Laura, but she's only a dream"
