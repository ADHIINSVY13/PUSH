  "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nWell I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home\nWhere a man and his thoughts lived all alone\nHe tried to live, no effort was shown\nHe's slowly finding a way back home\n[Verse]\nHe had a nice family with smiles and frowns\nThey never could solve his way to be down\n'Cause he's one dog who don't want a bone\nHe's slowly finding a way back home\nHe had a nice house with windows and doors\nHe said to his wife \"What's mine is yours\"\nBut the seeds of deception are soon to be sown\nHe's slowly finding a way back home\nHis children have left but the rooms are still there\nHis misses the noise and the scents in their hair\nBut far from the nest the babies have flown\nHe's slowly finding a way back home\nHis wife was an angel sent from above\nHe never returned her kisses or love\nBut soon he'd found that she'd overgrown\nThis man who's finding a way back home\nSo the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June\nThe rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon\nHe stares at the floor, no more to roam\nHe's slowly finding a way back home\n\n[Chorus]\nWell I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home\nWhere a man with regrets lived all alone\nHe tried to live, no effort was shown\nHe'll never find his way back home"
