And who am I\nTo not try to fix this\nI been all alone, all night\nTryin' not to listen to my thoughts\n[Chorus]\nI'm tired of talkin' to myself\nOf talkin' to myself\nOf talkin' to the man in the mirror\nThink that I could use some help, yeah\nMaybe someone else could help me see it clearer\nI've been drinkin', thinkin' too much\n[Refrain]\n'Cause all my youth, it washed away\nI took some pills and can't see straight\nNow I don't know which way to turn\n[Chorus]\nI'm tired of talkin' to myself\nOf talkin' to myself\nOf talkin' to the man in the mirror\nThink that I could use some help, yeah\nMaybe someone else could help me see it clearer\nI've been drinkin', thinkin' too much"
