Ain't it the life?\nAin't it the life? Got no crime\nJust sail on by, sail on by\nAin't it the life? Ain't it the life?\nAin't it the life? Got no crime\nJust sail on by, sail on by\nAin't it the life?\n[Post-Chorus]\nJust sail on by\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTry livin' a lie and kickin' out\nThe same old guise\nWastin' time\n[Chorus]\nAin't it the life? Ain't it the life?\nAin't it the life? Got no crime\nJust sail on by, sail on by\nAin't it the life? Ain't it the life?\nAin't it the life? Got no crime\nJust sail on by, sail on by\nAin't it the life?\nAin't it the life?"
