  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCan I try for something, far from a lie?\nCan I speak without you changing my mind?\nIndustry could take the best of me\nThis industry could swallow all of me\n[Chorus]\nHold on little sailor, it will be alright\nI know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight\nWe got so close to the fame and the life\nWatching the stars tonight\nLittle sailor, let's sail tonight\n[Verse 2]\nCan I live inside a bubble we call home?\nWilling to do anything, if I write a hit song\nAnd I'll ride this tide, I'll put some make-up on\nAnd I'll shock the crowd, 'cause it will sell my song\n[Chorus]\nHold on little sailor, it will be alright\nI know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight\nWe got so close to the fame and the life\nWatching the stars tonight\nLittle sailor, let's sail tonight\n\n[Verse 3]\nSix different managers, all filled with good intent\nThey promised me the world, I ain't seen nothing yet\nWork hard to stay alive, work hard to pay the rent\nStill need my mom and dad, they must be heaven sent\n[Chorus]\nHold on little sailor, it will be alright\nI know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight\nWe got so close to the fame and the life\nWatching the stars tonight\nLittle sailor, let's sail tonight"
