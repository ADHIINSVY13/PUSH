  "lyrics": "We set the same scene\nCircumstances different than they\nMight have been\nPeople in two places can be\nPulled into a scheme\nNever what you're fighting for\nLife alone\nLose a lover's arms\nNever makes it easy when you try too hard\nI wish you would define what you feel\nHard on or letting go\nI'm the Omega Man\nStand tall and understand\nEverybody needs a plan\nMine is a better way\nThere'll be trouble in the world\nSex and the single girl\nI'm an over-eager man\nFind me a better way\nFind me a better way\nWe share the same pain\nUnderneath the covers I will set you free\nI will prove to you my love is\nOlder than the sky\nStronger than the night is long\n\nLord of hearts\nLeader of us all\nLet it be together if we rise or fall\nOr is it just my imagination\nOr the light of a precious stone\n(You'll never be alone)\nI'm the Omega Man\nI travel over land\nEverybody needs a plan\nFind me a better way\nThere'll be trouble in the world\nSex and the single girl\nI'm an over-eager man\nFind me a better way\nFind me a better way\nHere at the scene of the crime\nLaid in your arms I will die\nI know it's more than infatuation\nThat's keeping this man alive\nI'm the Omega Man\nStand tall and understand\nEverybody needs a plan\nMine is a better way\nThere'll be trouble in the world\nSex and the single girl\nI'm an over-eager man\nFind me a better way\nFind me a better way\nI'm the Omega Man\nI travel over land\nEverybody needs a plan\nFind me a better way\nThere'll be trouble in the world\nSex and the single girl\nI'm an over-eager man\nFind me a better way\nFind me a better way"
