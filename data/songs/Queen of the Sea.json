  "lyrics": "If I was the Queen of the Sea\nAnd came upon you suddenly\nWould love really set us both free?\nIt's so hard to receive what could finally be\nTwo hearts can be beating in bloom\nThough not even in the same room\nAnd I was a lover, it's true\nThough I feel like a fool, I'm a lover of you\nI forgot myself\nDid you take the breath out of me?\nI forgot to lose myself\nAnd now we're just tragic thieves playing make-believe\nIf you were the king of the gloom\nAnd found me stuck in my doom\nWould we turn away from the graves\nOf mistakes that we've made trying not to resume?\nAnd go boom\nYou forgot yourself\nAnd darkness explodes out of me\nI forgot to tell myself\nThat love isn't too far to reach, if your heart is set free\nOoh\n\nIf time wouldn't move so fast\nAnd life could last and last\nWould everyone stay in the game\nThat they saved or complain? Or escape on a train?\nOoh\nOh, we forgot ourselves\nAnd lost what it means to believe\nWe forgot to hold ourselves\nAnd you made a mess out of me\nBut I'm finally free, ooh\nOh, you made a mess out of me\nBut I'm finally free, ooh\nOh, you made a mess out of me\nBut I'm finally free\nOoh, oh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh"
