Makaveli the Don\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nMy life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug\nHouse full of babies cryin' from a lack of gettin' love\nAin't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs\nHad the block sewn up, 'cause I learned to pack a gun\nDo you feel me? World, do you hear me?\nCatch a risin' star, fuck the love, niggas fear me\nGot these niggas runnin' all wild from my double-R\nWhen we ride, motherfuckers is sure to die\nBoom once I enter the room, in the air\nAll you hear is the whispers of doom, niggas scared\nThey don't wanna see me head on\nThink of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone\nCall a gravedigger, fuckin' with a made nigga\nM.O.B, gunfire, gettin' sprayed quicker\nFuck 'em all, let 'em understand my plot to get richer\nMuch more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac]\n(Can you feel me?)\nA motherfuckin' made nigga\nI got a plot to get richer\nTake my picture, a made nigga\n[Verse 2: Napoleon]\nNigga, I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat\nMy role model was killin' niggas, so I know I would never be weak\nThey got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins\nThese niggas crossed my father, then my father crossed them\n'Cause I roll with Immortal thug niggas\nAnd my number one plan to kill a man to grab a needle and drug niggas\nNiggas don't like us, because they bitches straight love us\nThe President told us to leave\n'Cause the government don't want us\nIt's Napoleon, I get my pleasure out of sinning\nAnd seein' blood spill ain't shit 'cause I seen it at the beginnin'\nA made nigga\n[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]\nHow many niggas fall in your vision?\nGunnin' 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison\nWe mash together, plus we get cash together\nBlast whenever, knowin' it don't last forever\nIt's only one way out and one way in\nMotherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men\nWe find excuses to loot, cock and shoot\nBlow the roof off and poof like Rahman Raouf\nI can't be touched 'cause of the weapons I clutch\nAnd the niggas that I'm under is just too much, we made niggas\n\n[Verse 4: E.D.I. Mean]\nPicture the scenery 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine\nCall me your prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen\nI began the paper, stackin' at those who be paper snatchin'\nWill emerge like crack in the 80's\nFade me? Maybe, that's if I slip\nBut I became official since the start of this, E.D.I. Mean\nBorn July, 7th, \na few shed eyes, precious\nBut others gave me they hate to cherish\nBut still I made it, a made nigga made by the game\nMade for war, my aim is simple and plain\nYeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain\nYou'll forever know my name, E.D., a made nigga\n[Verse 5: Kastro]\nI ain't count the line, my strap\nMy head, there will be none of that\nThe young hog, K-Dog playin' Outlaw Immortal combat\nWith the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga\n'Til he still and chill, recognize the real deal\nFeel — a nigga made when I was young and dumb\nWith a gun, but it pays, so I'm bustin' for fun\nAnd the outcome will be the same every time\nWe all gon' die, get yours 'cause I'ma get mine\n[Verse 6: Yaki Kadafi]\nTha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit\nRhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public\nWith my mentality of war, dead bodies and sirens\nGive it to you raw, thug nigga to the core\nThe results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level\nShootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil\nMash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year\nMade niggas on your motherfuckin' tear, I'm a made nigga\n\n[Verse 7: 2Pac]\nCall me a Bad Boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily\nKnow the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli\nGettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries\nGame, when applied, help me survive several centuries\nLock me in a cage, I'll display my rage\nSurround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray\nThey wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced\nOn my knees to God, beggin' for repentance\nI'm so convinced that I'm a thug\nThey got me fiendin' for my cash like a fiend when he dreams of drugs\nDiss Kidada and I'll kidnap your daughter\nKill your wife and hit the funeral and tell you just who gave the order\nMakaveli the Don 'til I'm gone\nI maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed\n'Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga\nOutlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nCan you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha\nGet into the mind of a made nigga, I can't be touched\nMy adversaries get fucked, feel me?\nMultimillionaire dreams\nAll I want is the C.R.E.A.M.\nI sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream\nCome and see, to see a made nigga\nOutlawz, Makaveli The Don\nHussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro\nNapoleon, Kadafi, Mussolini, M.O.B.\nI send this out to my niggas on the streets\nThe motherfuckin' made niggas\nAll my niggas on Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound\nTha Doggfather, and all his niggas\nYou know what time it is\nDaz Dillinger, Kurupt, Young Gotti\n(Hahaha, Westside made niggas, beyotch!!!)\n[Collision: 2Pac as a Police Officer & \nSergeant\n]\nUhh… Sarge… uhh…\nWe've got, uhh, Tupac Shakur\nUhh, Fatal, Fatal Hussein… uhh, Kastro, Kadafi\nWe got a bunch of niggas here\nThey've got guns in their car\nThey've got weed, they've got money\nThey're with a lot of black women, what should we do, Sarge?\nUhh, I repeat, let 'em go\nI repeat, let 'em go\nThey're made niggas… let 'em go\nBut, but Sarge, they've got guns, they've got weed\nI said, let 'em go\nAlright, you guys can go, I'm sorry\nI'm sorry about the-the mix up, you guys can go"
