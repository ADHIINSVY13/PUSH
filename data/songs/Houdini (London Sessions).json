(Ah-ah)\nI need somethin' that'll make me believe (Ah-ah)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n[Chorus]\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n[Post-Chorus]\nIf you're good enough, you'll find the way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change her ways\nDo you think about it night and day? (Hey)\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n\n[Bridge]\nOh-oh\nOoh\n[Chorus]\nI come and I go (Hey)\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n[Outro]\nHoudini\nCatch me or I go Houdini"
