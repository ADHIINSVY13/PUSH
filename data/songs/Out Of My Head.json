  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's a cold wind that's into my heart\nThere's woman tearing me apart\nThere's a voice I hear\nOf every word that she said\n[Chorus]\nI'm going out of my head\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a feeling I get every night\nThere's a thing I miss about holding her tight\nThere's an emptiness I just want her here in my bed\n[Chorus]\nI'm going out of my head\n[Bridge]\nSentimental fool in love am I\nThinking that true love would never die\nI know she said goodbye\nBut I ain't giving in\nIf I give her just a little while\nShe might see me again\n[Break]\nSentimental fool in love am I\nThinking that our love would never die\nI know that it's all wrong\nBut I'll think this instead\nWish I could have her back again\n\n[Chorus][x3]\nI'm going out of my head"
