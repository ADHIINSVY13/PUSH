  "lyrics": "If I were a painter\nI would paint my reverie\nIf that's the only way for you to be with me\nWe'd be there together\nJust like we used to be\nUnderneath the swirling skies for all to see\nAnd I'm dreaming of a place\nWhere I could see your face\nAnd I think my brush would take me there\nBut only...\nIf I were a painter\nAnd could paint a memory\nI'd climb inside the swirling skies to be\nWith you\nI'd climb inside the skies to be with you"
