  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's been a while since we been alone\nTo turn off the world and the telephone\nI need to tell you you're beautiful\n'Cause it's been a while and I apologize\nI just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'\nChasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'\nIf I stopped and took a look around\nIt's in front of my eyes, eyes\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBaby, let's slow down time\nMaybe just press rewind\nDarlin', that dress reminds\nMe of the first time\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wanna love tonight\nOne on one by the candlelight\nOver and over, we spend our lives\nLivin' fast forward but not tonight\nLove in slow motion\n[Verse 2]\nIt's been a while since it was you and me\nToo many friends, too many evening drinks\nYeah, we commit to so many things\nBut not to ourselves, and I apologize\nSometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'\nAnd I brush it off because there's always somethin'\nBut I need to change my perspective\nAnd prioritise-ise\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause one thing I know is this\nEvery moment missed\nCan be restored with your lips\nIt only takes one kiss\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wanna love tonight\nOne-on-one by the candlelight\nOver and over, we spend our lives\nLivin' fast forward but not tonight\nLove in slow motion\n[Bridge]\nOoh-ooh\nOoh-ooh\n[Chorus]\nLove tonight\nOne-on-one by the candlelight\nOver and over, we spend our lives\nLivin' fast forward but not tonight\nLove in slow motion\nWanna love tonight\nOne on one by the candlelight\nOver and over, we spend our lives\nLivin' fast forward but not tonight\nLove in slow motion\n\n[Outro]\nIn slow motion\nIn slow motion"
