  "lyrics": "The name of this song would be applied to the duo themselves in future releases.\n[Produced by Jeff Bass]\n[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]\nI reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts\nYou know, there's a story behind that there saloon\n20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over\nSheriffs couldn't stop 'em\nQuickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen\nGot murdered in cold-blood\nThat old saloon there was their little home away from home\nThey say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern\nAnd on a quiet night, you can still hear\nThe footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9\"\n[Verse 1: Eminem & \nRoyce Da \n5'9\n\"\n]\nI don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet\nI'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat\nI translate when my voice is read through a seismograph\nAnd the noise is spread\nPicked up and transmitted through Royce's head (\nUhh\n)\nTrap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed\n'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead\nTold him each one of his boys is dead (\nOhh\n)\nI asked him to come to the dark side\nHe made a choice and said (\nYo\n)\nWho hard? Yo, I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at each other\nTo see which one'll swerve first\nTwo blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity\nHolds that of a globe on top of nine other planets\nKissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level\nIs hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto\nDismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist\nInterceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot\nOne track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse\nIn my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse\nAnd stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the \nNation\nCollaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & \nRoyce Da 5'9\"\n]\n'Cause this is what happens when \nBad meets Evil\nWe hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAbove the law 'cause I don't agree with police either\nShit, me neither\n[Verse 2: Eminem & \nRoyce Da 5'9\"\n]\nWe ain't eager to be legal\nSo please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle\nI breathe ether in three lethal amounts\nWhile I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)\nReleasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range\nCold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain\n(\nHe's insane\n) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up\nAnd I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein\nThe disaster with dreads, \nI'm\n bad enough to commit suicide\nAnd survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead\nWhen in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter\n'Cause I serve any stranger with money\nI spray a hundred, man, until they \njoint chains\nWhile slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches\nPiss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral\nService lobby and strangle your body to confirm it\nWhippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws\nWith my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass\nI'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees\nSomehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me\nFrom all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough\nTo cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt\n\n[Interlude: Eminem]\nHello? \n(\nBilly?\n)\nAyo, whatâ€™s up? (\nWe're comin' to get you\n)\nStop, they know it's us\n[Verse 3: Eminem & \nRoyce Da 5'9\"\n]\nI used to be a loudmouth, remember me?\n (\nUh-uh\n)\nI'm the one who burned your house down (\nOh\n)\nWell, I'm out now\n (\nShit\n)\nAnd this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up\nAnd I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of\nGive me two fat tabs and three shrooms\nAnd you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms\nAnd when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave\nI'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe\n[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9\" & \nEminem\n]\n'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil\nAnd we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAgainst peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel\n(\nWe'll be waiting\n) See you in Hell (\nUh-huh\n)\nWall Street (\nYup\n), Royce Da 5'9\", Slim Shady (\nUh\n)\nSee you in Hell for the sequel (\nBye-bye\n)\nBad Meets Evil, what? (\nUntil next time\n)\n\n[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]\nAnd so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil\nTwo of the most wanted individuals in the county\nMade Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens\nIt's too bad they had to go out the way they did\nGot shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon\nBut their spirits still live on 'til this day\nShh, wait, did y'all hear that?"
