  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm back on dry land once again\nOpportunity awaits me like a rat in a drain\nWe're all hunting honey with money to burn\nJust a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned\n[Verse 2]\nIf the boys all behave themselves here\nWell, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear\nYou won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight\nOh, the prices I charge here will see you alright\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo she lays down beside me again\nMy sweet painted lady, the one with no name\nMany have used her and many still do\nThere's a place in the world for a woman like you\n[Chorus]\nOh, sweet painted lady\nSeems it's always been the same\nGetting paid for being laid\nGuess that's the name of the game\nOh, sweet painted lady\nSeems it's always been the same\nGetting paid for being laid\nGuess that's the name of the game, oh\n\n[Verse 3]\nForget us, we'll have gone very soon\nJust forget we ever slept in your rooms\nAnd we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds\nWhere love's just a job and nothing is said\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo as she lays down beside me again\nMy sweet painted lady, the one with no name\nMany have used her and many still do\nThere's a place in the world for a woman like you\n[Chorus]\nOh, sweet painted lady\nSeems it's always been the same\nGetting paid for being laid\nGuess that's the name of the game\nOh, sweet painted lady\nSeems it's always been the same\nGetting paid for being laid\nGuess that's the name of the game, oh"
