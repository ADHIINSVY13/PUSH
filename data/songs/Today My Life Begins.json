  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been working hard so long\nSeems like pain has been my only friend\nMy fragile heart's been done so wrong\nI wondered if I'd ever heal again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, just like all the seasons never stay the same\nAll around me I can feel a change (Oh)\n[Chorus]\nI will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me\nLeave the past behind me, today my life begins\nA whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking\nI know I can make it today my life begins\n[Verse 2]\nYesterday has come and gone\nAnd I've learn how to leave it where it is\nAnd I see that I was wrong\nFor ever doubting I could win\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, just like all the seasons never stay the same\nAll around me I can feel a change (Oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nI will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me\nLeave the past behind me, today my life begins\nA whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking\nI know I can make it today my life begins\n[Verse 3]\nLife's too short to have regrets\nSo I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget\nOnly have one life to live\nSo you better make the best of it\n[Chorus]\nI will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me\nLeave the past behind me, today my life begins\nA whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking\nI know I can make it today my life begins\n[Chorus]\nI will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me\nLeave the past behind me, today my life begins\nA whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking\nI know I can make it today my life begins"
