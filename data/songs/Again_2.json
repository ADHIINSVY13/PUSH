  "lyrics": "The first time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew\nThat it was wrong to do\nGuess that's why I was drawn to you\nThe second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time\nI feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright\nFleeting joy and fading ecstasy, here it goes again, oh\nSneaking fruit from the forbidden tree, sweet taste of sin\nAnd I'm doing it again; Yes I'm doing it again, oh I'm doing it again I said it would end but here it goes again\nThis time you told me you saw me at the same hotel\nYou said you knew me well, and I had a familiar smell\nYou asked me how am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you\nLike you want me to, 'cause I know what you're prone to do\nAccusations fly like bullets do, here it goes again oh\nYou know me because you're doing it too\nThe cycle never ends, never ends\nOh you're doing it again\nYes you're doing it again\nOh you're doing it again\nYou said it would end but here it goes again\nAnd again, and again\nDamn I love you, but this is crazy\nI have to fight you almost daily\nWe break up so fast\nAnd we, we make up so passionately\nWhy can't we just trust each other\nYou can't hate me and be my lover\nPassion ends, and pain begins, I come back...\n\nAnd we're doing it again\nYes we're doing it again\nOh we're doing it again\nWe said it would end\nBut, here it goes again\nEach time you call me home in a sweet refrain\nSaying things will change, you'll take away the pain\nThen we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me\nYou envelope me, you feel good as hell to me\nOne moment leads to another few\nHere it goes again oh\nOh leaving you is oh so hard to do\nI just can't pretend, can't pretend\nI keep doing it again, oh I'm doing it again\nYes I'm doing it again\nI said it would end, oh,oh, oh\nOh I'm doing it again\nI said it would end, oh,oh, oh\nOh I'm doing it again\nI said it would end but here it goes again\nAgain"
