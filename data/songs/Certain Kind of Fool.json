  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe was a poor boy, raised in a small family\nHe kinda had a craving for something no one else could see\nThey said that he was crazy, the kind that no lady should meet\nHe ran off to the city and wandered around in the street\n[Chorus]\nHe wants to dance, oh yeah\nHe wants to sing, oh yeah\nHe wants to see the lights a-flashing\nAnd listen to the thundering\n[Verse 2]\nHe saw it in a window, the mark of a new kind of man\nHe kind of liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand\nHe took it to the country and practiced for days without rest\nAnd then one day he felt it, he knew he could stand with the best\n[Chorus]\nThey got respect, oh yeah\nHe wants the same, oh yeah\nAnd it's a certain kind of fool\nThat likes to hear the sound of his own name\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nA poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man\nHe had a reputation spreading like fire through the land\nIt wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way\nIt wasn't for the running, but now he's running every day"
