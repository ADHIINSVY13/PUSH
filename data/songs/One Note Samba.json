  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThis is just a little samba, built upon a single note\nOther notes are bound to follow, but the root is still that note\nNow this new one is the consequence of the one we've just been through\nAs I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you\n[Verse 1]\nThere's so many people who can talk and talk and talk\nAnd just say nothing, or nearly nothing\nI have used up all the scale I know and at the end\nI've come to nothing, or nearly nothing\n[Verse 2]\nSo I come back to my first note, as I must come back to you\nI will pour into that one note, all the love I feel for you\nAnyone who wants the whole show, re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do\nHe will find himself with no show, better play the note you know\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 1]\nThere's so many people who can talk and talk and talk\nAnd just say nothing, or nearly nothing\nI have used up all the scale I know and at the end\nI've come to nothing, or nearly nothing\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I come back to my first note, as I must come back to you\nI will pour into that one note, all the love I feel for you\nAnyone who wants the whole show, re-mi-fa-sol-la-si-do\nHe will find himself with no show, better play the note you know"
