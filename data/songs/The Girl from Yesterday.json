  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt wasn't really sad the way they said good-bye\nOr maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry\nHe packed his things, walked out the door and drove away\n[Chorus]\nAnd she became the girl from yesterday\n[Verse 2]\nHe took a plane across the sea\nTo some foreign land\nShe stayed at home and tried so hard to understand\nHow someone who had been so close could be so far away\n[Chorus]\nAnd she became the girl from yesterday\n[Verse 3]\nShe doesn't know what's right\nShe doesn't know what's wrong\nShe only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long\nAnd she doesn't count the teardrops\nThat she's cried while he's away\nBecause she knows deep in her heart\nThat he'll be back someday\n\nThe light's on in the window, she's waiting by the phone\nTalking to a memory that's never coming home\nShe dreams of his returning and the things that he might say\n[Outro]\nBut, she'll always be the girl from yesterday[x2]"
