Don't doubt me\nI can make it squirt while I skrrt in the Audi\nBitch, I'm outie after that, oddy's after that\nTouch your Instagram, put you on the map\nDon't discriminate, fuck a handicap, no legs\nFuck that, where your titties at, bitch?\n[Verse 2: Yung Plague]\nBa-Ba-Back in the Golden Days, I was glowin' rays\nNow I'm soaked in grey from all these fuckin' growin' pains\nKeep on throwin' shade, you'll meet the fuckin' Shogun's blade\nI'm stealing trophies out your trophy case\nFuck the cards I was dealt\nI got a poker face to steal an open base, ho\nFuck an older age though\nIf life's a book, rip out the last page and roll up a J Lo\nBitch, I'm Yung Plague, no way I'ma grow fangs\nRip out your throat, ain't sayin' anything out that hole, mane\n\n[Verse 3: Yung $carecrow]\nHundred pills bottles on my motherfuckin' dresser, mane\nCouple lil' models all up in my Twitter mentions, mane\nI'm the mane that'll make a stain out of your fuckin' brain\nSmokin' strains off some strange grain that I can't explain\nFuck the fame, fuck these fuckin' lames, that's why I isolate\nCan't relate to none of you motherfuckers\nKeep me in my grave, hold up, wait\nDuckin' in the shade, shooting up the H\nStuck at Hell's gates with Yung Plague\nAnd I'm draped in grey"
