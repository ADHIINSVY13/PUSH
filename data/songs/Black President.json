They said\n[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can\n change the world, the world, the world\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can,\n change the world\nThe world, the world, the WORLD...\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nThey forgot us on the block, got us in the box\nSolitary confinement:\n how violent are these cops?\nThey need a early retirement\nHow many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march\nI got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought\nPublic housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex\nMy set, my clique, either getting money\nOr running from homicide trial, that's if they ain't died yet\nTrying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance\nA predicate felon, a ghetto leader\nLending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it\nI bleed this from \nQueensbridge\n, now living with my feet up\nNever defeated, so a president's needed\nYou know these colored folks and Negros hate to see\nOne of their own succeeding\nAmerica: surprise us and let a black man guide us, uhh\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can, change the world\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can, change the world\nThe world, the world, the WORLD...\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nWhat's the black pres' thinking on election night?\nIs it: \"How can I protect my life?\nProtect my wife? Protect my rights?\"\nEvery other president was nothing less than white\nExcept Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge\nKKK is like: \"What the fuck?!\", loading their guns up\nLoading up mine too, ready to ride\n'Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too\nYeah, but on the positive side\nI think Obama provides hope and challenges minds\nOf all races and colors to erase the hate\nAnd try to love one another,\n \nso many political snakes\nWe in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brother\n...but will he keep it way real?\nEvery innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal\nWhen he wins, will he really care still?\nI feel\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can, change the world\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can, change the world\nThe world, the world, the WORLD...\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nSay a prayer for \"Do we have to?\"\nYou ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor\nIn love with a slave master\nSincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper\nJesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper\nAsk around: Bentley coupe off the Richter\nBitch called \"Life\": I pimped her, what\nPolitics, politricks, Klan-shooter\nDeacon for defense, progress-producer\nNothing on the stove, a survival-booster\nGotta do what we gotta do\nWe ain't got no governors coming through to help\nAnything we need done, gotta do for self\nNew, improved JFK on the way\nIt ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again\nWe ain't falling for the same traps\nStanding on the balconies where they shot the King at\nMcCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that\nPeople need honesty\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Polygon (2Pac sample)]\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can, change the world\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...} they say\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black president\")\nYes we can, change the world\nThe world, the world, the WORLD...\n[Outro: Governor Bill Richardson]\nIt is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce to you\nThe next President of the United States - Barack Obama\n{*crowd cheers LOUDLY*}"
