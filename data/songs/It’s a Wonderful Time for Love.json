  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nIt's a wonderful time for love\nIt's a wonderful time for love\nSun shines down from above\nIt's a wonderful time for love\nAnd you think you have all you dreamed of\nBut all the great blue skies just ain't enough\n[Chorus]\nWhen the sun goes down\nWe sleep safe and sound\nA wonderful time for love\nTime for dealing a different game\nOne where we don't have to place the blame\n[Verse]\nHow much can we bear?\nIf pain is all we share\nA wonderful time for love\nSuch a beautiful time to rise\nAnd walk away from all the endless lies\nAnd try to see the world through other eyes"
