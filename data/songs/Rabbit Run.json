Here's a piece of mine\nAll I need's a line\nBut sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme\nTo express how I'm really feelin' at that time\nYeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes\nIt's just “Sometimes”, it's always me\nHow dark can these hallways be?\nThe clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three\nThis half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper\nI'm desperate at my desk\nIf I could just get the rest of the shit off my chest again\nStuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'\nFuck, I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin', \nnope\nIt's not good enough, scribble it out\nNew pad, crinkle it up and throw the shit out\nI'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out\nBall's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out\nI'm afraid, but why am I afraid?\nWhy am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave\nReal enough to rile you up\nWant me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want\nI'm a switch hitter\n, \nbitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter\nI'ma sit, until I get enough in me to finally hit a\nFuckin' boilin' point, \nput some oil in your joints\nFlip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed\nAn MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense\nThey hate me, see me, and shake like a chainlink fence\nBy the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'\nBy the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone\nBy the way they're runnin' you would swear the law was comin'\nIt's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'\n“Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us\nHe said he'd be back, he pinky-promised, I don't think he's honest”\nI'll be back, baby, I just gotta beat this clock\nFuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch\nDon't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race\nAnd I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch\nI found my niche, you gon' hear my voice\nTill you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice\nIf I gotta scream, till I have half a lung\nIf I have half a chance, I'll grab it—\nRabbit, run"
