  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight\nI stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night\nThe roses are sighing a Moonlight Serenade\n[Verse 2]\nThe stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming\nMy love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?\nI bring you and I sing you a Moonlight Serenade\n[Bridge]\nLet us stray 'till break of day in love's valley of dreams\nJust you and I, a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissin' the trees\n[Verse 3]\nSo don't let me wait, come to me tenderly in the June night\nI stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight\nA love song, my darling, a Moonlight Serenade"
