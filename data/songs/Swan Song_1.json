Oh\nWhat is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out\nOnly I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down\nI won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet\n'Cause staying silent's the same as dying\nI won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now\n[Chorus]\nThis is not a, this is not a swan, swan song\nThis is not a, this is not a swan, swan song\nWe just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight\nThis is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive\nYeah, it's a new life\n[Verse 2]\nReal fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh\nWhat is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out\nOnly I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down\nI won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet\n'Cause staying silent's the same as dying\nI won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is not a, this is not a swan, swan song\nThis is not a, this is not a swan, swan song\nWe just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight\nThis is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive\nYeah, it's a new life\n[Bridge]\nTread heavily around me\nTread heavily around me\nTread heavily\nTread heavily around me\nTread heavily, tread\n[Chorus]\nThis is not a, this is not a\nSwan (\nTread heavily\n), swan song (\nTread\n)\nThis is not a, this is not a\nSwan (\nTread heavily\n), swan song (\nTread\n)\nWe just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight (\nTread heavily\n)\nThis is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive\nYeah, it's a new life\n[Outro]\nIt's a new life"
