  "lyrics": "Here I stand\nWithout an overcoat in January\nWhere did I go wrong\nI try to smile\nBut my heart's a heavy load to carry\nBaby, now you're gone\nMaybe there's a way to stop\nThe rain before it's falling\nMaybe I'm a fool to even try\nBut I can't say goodbye\nHow can I walk away\nWhen my heart wants you to stay\nAnd I can't tell you why\nI know the feeling's gone and I know I should be strong\nBut I just can't say goodbye\nHere I go\nRunning after dreams and chasing rainbows\nTrying to hold on to your heart\nI made it through another lonely night\nJust thinking of you\nI long to be right where you are\nMaybe there's a way to stop\nThe hands of time from turning\nMaybe it just hurts too much to try\n\nBut I can't say goodbye\nHow can I walk away\nWhen my heart wants you to stay\nAnd I can't tell you why\nI know the feeling's gone and I know I should be strong\nBut I just can't say goodbye\nMaybe there's a way to stop\nThe rain before it's falling\nMaybe I'm a fool to even try\nI can't say goodbye\nHow can I walk away\nWhen my heart wants you to stay, oh yeah\nAnd I can't tell you why\nYes, I know the feeling's gone, and I know I should be strong\nBut I just can't say goodbye\nNo I just can't say goodbye"
