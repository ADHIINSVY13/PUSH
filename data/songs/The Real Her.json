Lipstick on the glass\nSee, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi\n[Chorus: Drake]\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time\nWe must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind\nYou got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)\n\n[Verse 4: Andr√© 3000]\nShower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip\nGuarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship\nAll of them ain't all equipped\nAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order\nQuote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor\nThose that get laughed at sit off in a corner\nLike a lab rat, nobody want her\nNiggas that are married don't wanna go home\nBut we look up to them, they wish they were us\nThey want some new trim, we lust for some trust\nNow the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener\nWhich leaves your turf in a Boise state\nCan't see a play or the team, 'cause\nEverybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you\nAnd those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, \"That ain't true\"\nAll of them will have an opinion\nBut y'all know what y'all can do with them\nBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour\nTo a place you can stick that in\nWell, sitting here sad as hell\nListening to Adele, I feel you, baby\n\"Someone Like You,\" more like someone unlike you\nOr something that's familiar maybe\nAnd I can tell that she wants a baby\nAnd I can yell, girl, that you're crazy\nOh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy\nPlease be careful, bitches got the rabies"
