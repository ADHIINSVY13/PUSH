Mama, why we live so poor?\nWhy you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door\nNow, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?\nGet my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger\nAnd still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block\nHearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop\nProud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?\nDon't look around, buster (You sucker)\nCheck yourselves\nKnow what it means to be black, whether a man or girl\nWe still strugglin' in this white man's world\n\n[Chorus: Darryl Harper & \n2Pac\n]\nWho knows what tomorrow brings\n(Born black in this white man's world)\nIn this world where everyone's blind?\n(In this white man's world)\nAnd where to go, no matter how far, I'll find\n(In this white man's world)\nTo let you know that you're not alone\n[Collision: Khalid Abdul Muhammad]\nWe must fight for brother \nMumia\nWe must fight for brother \nMutulu\nAnd we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee\nWe must fight for brother \nGeronimo Pratt\nWe must fight for Frankie Moore, Zulu, Kofi\nWe must fight for the countless political prisoners\nWho are locked up falsely by this white man\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nSo, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction\nIn the blink of an eye?\nMy time away just made perfection\nDid you think I'd die?\nNot gon' cry, why should I care?\nLike we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there\nCan you please help me?\nGod bless me, please keep my seeds healthy\nMakin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy\nHopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells\nJust in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell\nSister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart\nI know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart\nRest in peace to \nLatasha,\n \nLil' Yummy,\n and \nKato\nToo much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal\nEvery woman in America, especially black\nBear with me, can't you see that we under attack?\nI never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama\nHope we make it to better times, in this white man's world\n\n[Chorus: Darryl Harper]\nWho knows what tomorrow brings\nIn this world where everyone's blind?\nAnd where to go, no matter how far, I'll find\nTo let you know that you're not alone\n[Collision: Louis Farrakhan]\nYou're out of touch with reality\nThere are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people, white and black, red, yellow, and brown, poor and vulnerable are suffering in this nation\n[Interlude: 2Pac]\nNever that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us\nWe've been here all this time\nThey ain't took us out, they can never take us out\nNo matter what they say, about us bein' extinct\nAbout us bein' endangered species\nWe ain't never gon' leave this\nWe ain't never gon' walk off this planet\nUnless y'all choose to\nUse your brain, use your brain\nIt ain't them that's killin' us, it's us that's killin' us\nIt ain't them that's knockin' us off\nIt's us that's knockin' us off\nI'm tellin' you better watch it, or be a victim\nBe a victim, in this white man's world\nBorn black, in this white man's world, no doubt\nAnd it's dedicated to my motherfuckin' teachers\nMutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal\nSekou Odinga, all the real OG's, we out\n[Outro: Louis Farrakhan]\nThe seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking of the founding fathers, that this was to be a nation by white people; and for white people, Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-white people were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation"
