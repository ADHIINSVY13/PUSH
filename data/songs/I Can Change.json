Yea, on some Romeo and Juliet, ha ha\nI can change baby, gimme the room\nI can make your \nzoom zoom\n go boom boom!\nThis is legendary shit right here, baby\n\n[Outro]\nGotta believe me (you gotta believe me baby)\nGotta believe me (mmm yeah)\nI'm telling the truth\nGet baptized if you want it\nThis time I mean it\nGotta believe me (this time I mean it)\nGotta believe me\nI'm telling the truth"
