(Oh, no no)\nWhen my heart's been slowly breaking\nThey say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else\n(Whoa, oh)\n[Chorus]\nGuess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)\nGuess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)\nThey say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else (Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)"
