(Did I cross the line? Did I cross the line?)\n[Bridge]\nYou say no one knows you so well (Oh)\nBut every time you touch me, I just wonder (Ah) how she felt\n(Oh) Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel\nI know you didn't (Oh) mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wonder\nDo you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?\n[Outro]\nYou say no one knows you so well\nBut every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt\nValentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel\nI know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself"
