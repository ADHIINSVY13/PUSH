  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou lost your mind, I could not go\nWhat little time we spent, a penny on the floor\nMy desperation, a spinnin' top\nRevolvin' on and on, a world that never stops\nIs it all mine? How could I know?\nWe threw the rind away, swallowed all the core\nTried levitation, you're not alone\nThe stars are holdin' open a door we'll never close\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI have an engine made of gold\nSomethin' so beautiful, the world will never know\n[Chorus]\nOur roots are stronger than you know\nUp through the concrete they will grow\n[Verse 2]\nIs it all mine? I can't let go\nWhat little time we spent, a penny on the floor\nMy desperation, is this a curse?\n'Til death do us part, for better or for worse\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI have an engine made of gold\nSomethin' so beautiful, the world will never know\n\n[Chorus]\nOur roots are stronger than you know\nUp through the concrete they will grow\nOur roots are stronger than you know\nUp through the concrete we will grow\n[Outro]\nFuck you, Darrell!"
