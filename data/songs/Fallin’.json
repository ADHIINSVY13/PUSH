(Fallin')\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nUhh, said where I would stop before I even started\nWhen I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with\nGot to one brick, then I looked to the sky like:\n\"Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more try\"\n (Try)\nGot to two bricks, new cars, new whips\nBut niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip\nThe irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it\nGuess it's two sides to what substance abuse is\nCan't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit\nBrand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless\nFront row fight night, see how big my tube is\nFuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?\nBut there's a price for overdoing it\nDoing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax\nPlus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back\nDamn...\n\n[Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)]\nI know I shouldn’t've did that\nI know it's gon' come right back\nI know it's gon' destroy everything I made\nIt's probably gon' get ya boy sent away\nBut this game I play, ain't no way to fix it\nIt's inevitable, (Now ya) fallin'\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z, (Bilal)]\nWhen you should've fell back\nNow you (Fallin'), right into they lap\nFallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen\nDamn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene\n'Godfather'\n, \n'Goodfellas'\n, \n'Scarface'\n, \n'Casino'\nYou seen what that last run did to De Niro in \n'Heat'\nCan't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods\nCan't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards\nNow your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling\nUnder your breath, like you knew this day was coming (Fallin')\nNow let's pray that arm candy\nThat you left your ex for, stay down and come in handy\n'Cause come January it gets cold\nWhen the letters start to slow\n, \nand your commissary's low\nAnd lawyers screams appeal, only thinking about a bill\nAnd your chances are nil\nDamn, gravity's ill...\n\n[Chorus: Bilal (Jay-Z)]\nI know I shouldn’t've did that\nI know it's gon' come right back\nI know it's gon' destroy everything I made\nIt's probably gon' get ya boy sent away\nBut this game I play, ain't no way to fix it\nIt's inevitable, (But ya) fallin'\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z, (Bilal)]\nAnd you can't get up\nAll you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up\nLocked down, the town now belongs to the squares\nWho said they won't make the same mistake that got you there\nAnd your arm candy sweet on 'em\nAnd the women that you left for this heifer got a college degree coming\nBad news keeps coming, hard to keep something in your stomach\nYou're sick about what your life is becoming (Fallin')\nBut your \"used-to\"s, \"has-been\"s, ragging bad about all the new dudes\nTalking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do\nBut that's old school to the new crew\nThey doing numbers like Sudoku\nThey're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable\nThey'll experience déja vu too\nFight and you'll never survive, run and you'll never escape\nSo just fall from grace\nDamn...\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nI know I shouldn’t've did that\nI know it's gon' come right back\nI know it's gon' destroy everything I made\nIt's probably gon' get ya boy sent away\nBut this game I play, ain't no way to fix it\nIt's inevitable that I'm...\n[Outro: Bilal]\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'\nFallin', seems like I'm fallin'"
