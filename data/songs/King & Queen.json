Blige]\nWe'll make this picture complete, start a new family\nA boy that looks just like you, a girl that looks just like me\nAnd each day that they grow, we'll teach them all that we know\nHelp me show them the way\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nWe'll show them we're not afraid to be free\nThe only limit should be\nThe flyest fantasies, the highest they can dream\nGrab hold to my hand, say that you'll be my man\nSomeday you'll be my king, and baby, I'm your queen to be\n[Chorus: John Legend & Mary J. Blige, \nMary J. Blige\n]\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\nWe could be king and queen someday (\nSomeday\n)\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (\nLa-la, la-la-la\n)\nWe'll never throw our dreams away\n[Bridge: John Legend & Mary J. Blige]\nCities may crumble, the world is in trouble\nBut we'll be in love and we'll rise above it\nEach of our people, pray for a leader\nI know we will be someday, someday, oh\nSomeday, someday, someday, oh, someday\n[Outro: John Legend & Mary J. Blige, \nMary J. Blige\n]\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (\nLa-la-la-la\n)\nWe'll never throw our dreams away\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la-la-la)\nWe could be king and queen someday (Someday)\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (\nOh\n)\nWe'll never throw our dreams away"
