  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMy body is a map of LA\nI stand straight like an angel with a halo\nHangin' out the Hilton Hotel window\nScreamin', \"Hey, you, baby, let's go\"\nMy chest, the Sierra Madre\nMy hips, every high and byway\nThat you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota\nRun your hands over me like a Land Rover\n[Chorus]\nIn Arcadia, Arcadia\nAll roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries\nThat pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me\nAmerica, America\nI can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel\nOr a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl\nFindin' my way to you, Arcadia\n[Verse 2]\nMy body is a map of LA\nAnd my heart is like paper, I hate you\nI'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here\nI'm not native, but\nMy curves, San Gabriel all day\nAnd my lips like the fire licks the bay\nIf you think that you know yourself, you can come over\nLay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover\n\n[Chorus]\nIn Arcadia, Arcadia\nAll roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries\nThat get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me\nAmerica, I need a miracle\nI can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel\nOr a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl\nFindin' my way to you, Arcadia\n[Outro]\nThey built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down\nSo I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter and this town\nArcadia\nFindin' my way to you\nI'm leavin' them as I was, five-foot-eight, Western belt\nPlus the hate that they gave\nBy the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for you\nBut you'll need a miracle, America"
