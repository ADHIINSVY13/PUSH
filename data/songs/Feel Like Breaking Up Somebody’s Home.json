  "lyrics": "Lying 'round home alone\nOn a rainy night like this\nStarving for your love\nHungry for just one kiss\nEvery raindrop I hear\nAgainst my window pane\nSpeaks so loud and clear\nOh Lord, spells out your name\nGot nowhere to turn, tired of being alone\nFeel like breakin' up somebody's home\nI know it's useless\nHanging on when you belong to someone else\nCan't control the feelin'\n'Cause after all, I didn't make myself\nLast night, I cried so hard\nI believe I caught a chill\nCan't stand the vibration\nAnd oh, my heart just won't stand still\nGot nowhere to turn, tired of being alone\nFeel like breakin' up somebody's home\nGot nowhere to turn, tired of being alone\nFeel like breakin' up somebody's home\nI know it's useless\nHanging on when you belong to someone else\nCan't control my feelin'\n'Cause after all, I didn't make myself\nGot nowhere to turn, tired of being alone\nFeel like breakin' up somebody's home\nGot nowhere to turn, tired of being alone\nFeel like breakin' up somebody's home\nGot nowhere to turn, tired of being alone\nFeel like smashin' up somebody's home\nFeel like breakin' up somebody's home"
