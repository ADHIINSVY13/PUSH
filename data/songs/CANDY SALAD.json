And\nSlayer, the game playa, take fame or the fame takes ya\nSo if you know the motto, then bottle up all your haters\nAnd follow up on your paper, follow us to the nature\nThe jungle is all around you, but lions no longer chase ya\n[Interlude]\nIt's a drag wit' no tuck\nMmh-mmh-mmh\nMmh-mmh-mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh\nMmh-mmh-mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh\nLala-da-da-dada, ah-lala-da-da-dada\nLala-da-da-dada, ah-lala-da-da-dada\nLa-la-la-ah, Lala-da-da-da-da\nAh-lala-da-da-dada, ah-lala-da-da-dada (Yuh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLife's a drag with no tuck\nWe grind wit' no chucks, we're gold wit' no luck\nWe see 'em gettin' high and don't give no fucks\n'Cause all my hoes gold, and digits and toes done, aye\nSick of yo' old stuff and niggas is cold cut\nThey always goin' ham in the venue and roll blunts like\nShow 'em they fall off and niggas keep throwin' fuss like\n'Cause you tough in the time that it all took, uh\nThat I realize that inside they all shook\nSome say I am spineless, I don't own books\nAnd I am just an author, author to the crooks\nI'm farther than I should be, obviously true\nAll the pussy that I been on should make me ill\nCoughin' out the bills and parkin' in the Hills\nMy mindset's kinda awkward, pro'ly 'cause of pills, um\nCan't spell delivery without 'devil'\nSometimes you gotta hit rock bottom to reach my level\nSometimes you gotta get past all of them and test 'em\nI wish I could see through all thems preceptions\nWinter is a bitch and it's meltin' off my septum\nSee, me and my niggas don't regret nun', nah-ah\nThis ain't fo' yo' kids, so, mama, viewer discretion\nHa, I warned ya (Is it warm? Is it cold)\n[Outro]\nI warned ya, I warned ya\nI warned y'all niggas, um\nLala-da-da-dada\nAh-lala-da-da-dada, lala-da-da-da\nLala-da-dada-da\nMmm-mhm\nLa-la-dada-da, ah-la-la-dada-da\nAh-la-la-dada-da\nMmm, no, no-oh\nEh-um, eh-um\nEh-um, eh-um\nAyy-yeah-um, ayy-yeah-um\nAyy-yeah-um, ayy, yeah-um\nUm-um, um-um\nUm-um, um-um, alright"
