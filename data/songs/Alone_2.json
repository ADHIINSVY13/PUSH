In the track, Doja talks about becoming comfortable with herself and learning to accept being alone.\n[Chorus]\nBaby, when you fought me at the door\nKinda hard to force what's natural\nMaybe you don't want what you need most\nIs it crazy I'm not scared to be \nalone\n?\n[Post-Chorus]\nNow I barely need ya\nDo what you do best and be \nalone\nGotta tell him, \"Rest in peace\"\nBet you thought I'd die \nalone\nIt don't make sense to me\nBut I keep my head up high \nalone\nYou ain't even there for me\nBut now, you're scared to be \nalone\n[Verse 1]\nToo many drinks to think about you\nI had too many thoughts to let you wander\nNow you're an afterthought, I lost ya\nAnd now you want me, babe\nYou want me, but it's bye\nGivin' mе reasons to fly\nPack up my shit and be wise\nJump in thе ride\nHit up my dude on the side\nLike, look what you threw to the side\nYou get the vibe\nEither we fuck or we fight\nBut I got the feelin' you're right\nI'm out my mind\nDoesn't make sense when I cry\nIf we can't make up, 'least we try\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)\nKinda hard to force what's natural\n (Oh, oh, oh)\nMaybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)\nIs it crazy I'm not scared to be \nalone\n? (Yeah)\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you\nNot the man I need (Yeah)\nStarted feelin' like I failed my team\nMissin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me\nDifferent levels to the game, that's fast\nSpendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)\nLonely at the top while your ass miles deep\nGot me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me\nImpossible, from a Prius to gold carriages\nMiddle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is\nI need a answer, a reader of more tarots\nYou couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist\nI made you fam when I greeted your whole parents\nBut later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is\nI know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it\nBut bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it\n[Chorus]\nBaby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)\nKinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)\nMaybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)\nIs it crazy I'm not scared to be \nalone\n?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nNow I barely need ya (I barely need ya)\nDo what you do best and be \nalone\nGotta tell him, \"Rest in peace\"\nBet you thought I'd die \nalone\nIt don't make sense to me\nBut I keep my head up high \nalone\nYou ain't even there for me\nBut now, you're scared to be \nalone\nAlone\nNow you scared to be \nalone"
