  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStrangers in the night exchanging glances\nWondering in the night, what were the chances?\nWe'd be sharing love before the night was through\n[Verse 2]\nSomething in your eyes was so inviting\nSomething in your smile was so exciting\nSomething in my heart told me I must have you\n[Chorus]\nStrangers in the night\nTwo lonely people, we were strangers in the night\nUp to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know\nLove was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and\n[Verse 3]\nEver since that night we've been together\nLovers at first sight, in love forever\nIt turned out so right for strangers in the night\n[Bridge]\nLove was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away\n[Verse 3]\nEver since that night we've been together\nLovers at first sight, in love forever\nIt turned out so right for strangers in the night\n\n[Outro]\nDooby-doooby-doo\nDoob-dooob-doob-dee-daa\nDaaa-daaa-daaa-daaa-daaa"
