  "lyrics": "We both acknowledge what we came here for\nWe take each other and walk through the open door\nFrom the first time that I saw you\nTo the way you look tonight\nI was shaken by your spirit\nI was blinded by your light\nAnd the world that I used to see is gone without a trace\nReplaced by your eyes and the smile upon your face\nAnd I will not turn away\n'Cause you might disappear\nI was haunted by your heart\nAnd I felt that you were here\nAnd funny when the time is right\nWhen lightning strikes\nYou're not alone\nBaby, I will pray for you my whole life through\nThis day\nWe'll be together\nHusband and wife\nNow and forever\nThe rest of our lives\nWell, take me to Heaven\nTake me tonight\nThere is nothing words can say\nOn this our wedding day\n\nOh, now is the hour, now is the sowing of the seed\nI will take tomorrow\nI will lay it at your feet\nAnd the two of us escape from the sadness of the world\nFrom the thunder and the darkness\nFrom the hunger and the hurt\nYou know I will remember well the mission bell\nThat rings your name\nAnd baby there could never be\nA memory like you\nWe'll be together\nHusband and wife\nNow and forever\nLovers for life\nWell, take me to Heaven\nTake me tonight\nThere is nothing words can say\nOn this our wedding day\nThis is my pledge to you\nI will follow through to the end\nAnd we will find another plane\nWe'll be home again\nAnd tonight I'm going to find true love, true love\n\nWe'll be together\nHusband and wife\nNow and forever\nLovers for life\nWell, take me to Heaven\nTake me tonight\nThere is nothing words can say\nOn this our wedding day\nThis our wedding day"
