  "lyrics": "If I don't see her each day, I miss her\nGee what a thrill, each time I kiss her\nBelieve me, I've got a case\nOf Nancy, with the laughing face\nShe takes the winter and makes it summer\nAnd summer could take some lessons from her\nPicture a tomboy in lace\nThat's Nancy with the laughing face\nHave you ever heard mission bells ringing\nWell she'll give you the very same glow\nWhen she speaks you would think it was singing\nJust hear her say hello\nI swear to goodness, you can't resist her\nSorry for you, she has no sister\nNo angel could replace\nNancy, with the laughing face"
