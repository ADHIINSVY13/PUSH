  "lyrics": "In the fourth track on Sam Smithâ€™s debut album In The Lonely Hour, Sam sings of their pain in regards to a forbidden love.\n[Verse 1]\nI don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold\nWhat use is money when you need someone to hold?\nDon't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road\nWaiting for you to bring me in from out the cold\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou'll never know the endless nights\nThe rhyming of the rain\nOr how it feels to fall behind\nAnd watch you call his name\n[Chorus]\nPack up and leave everything\nDon't you see what I can bring?\nCan't keep this beating heart at bay\nSet my midnight sorrow free\nI will give you all of me\nJust leave your lover, leave him for me\nLeave your lover, leave him for me\n[Verse 2]\nWe sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old\nOh, I'm in love with you and you will never know\nBut if I can't have you, I'll walk this life alone\nSpare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou'll never know the endless nights\nThe rhyming of the rain\nOr how it feels to fall behind\nAnd watch you call his name\n[Chorus]\nPack up and leave everything\nDon't you see what I can bring?\nCan't keep this beating heart at bay\nSet my midnight sorrow free\nI will give you all of me\nJust leave your lover, leave him for me\nLeave your lover, leave him for me\nLeave your lover, leave him for me"
