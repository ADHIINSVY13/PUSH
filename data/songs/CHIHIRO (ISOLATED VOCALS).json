(Back around)\nNot today, maybe tomorrow\n[Chorus]\n(Oh, oh) Open up the door, can you open up the door?\nI know you said before you can't cope with any more (More)\nYou told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store (Store)\nI hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?\n[Refrain]\nDid you take\nMy love away\nFrom me? Me\nMe (Mm-mm)\n[Verse 2]\nSaw your seat at the counter when I looked away (Saw your seat at the counter)\nSaw you turn around, but it wasn't your face (Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face)\nSaid, \"I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break\" (Wasn't your face)\nHow come when I returned (How come when I), you were gone away?\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't, I don't know why I called\nI don't know you at all (I don't know you)\nI don't (I don't know you at all) know you\nNot at all (Not at all)\nI don't, I don't know why I called (Ah)\nI don't know you at all\nI don't (Ah) know you\n[Refrain]\nDid you take\nMy love (My love) away\nFrom me? Me\n(Mm)\n[Interlude]\nAnd that's when you found me\n[Verse 3]\nI was waitin' in the garden\nContemplatin', beg your pardon?\nBut there's a part of me that recognizes you\nDo you feel it too?\nWhen you told me it was serious\nWere you serious? Mm\nThey told me they were only curious\nBut now it's serious, mm-mm\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ah) Open up the door, can you open up the door?\nI know you said before you can't cope with any more\nYou told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store\nI hope it's not for sure, can you open up the (Ah) door? (Ah-ah-ah, ah-mm)\n[Post-Chorus]\nWringing my hands in my lap\nAnd they tell me it's all been a trap\nAnd you don't know if you'll make it back\nI said, \n\"No, don't say that\"\n[Outro]\n(Wringing my hands in my lap)\n(And you tell me it's all been a trap)\n(And you don't know if you'll make it back)\n(But I said, \"No, don't say that\")\n(Wringing my hands in my lap)\n(Tell me it's all been a trap)\n(Don't know if you'll make it back)\n(Don't say that)\n(Hm) Hm-hm"
