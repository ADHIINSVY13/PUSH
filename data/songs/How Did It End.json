  "lyrics": "[Intro]\n(Uh-oh, uh-oh)\n[Verse 1]\nWe hereby conduct this post-mortem\nHe was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman\nOur maladies were such we could not cure them\nAnd so a touch that was my birthright became foreign\n[Chorus]\nCome one, come all, it's happenin' again\nThe empathetic hunger descends\nWe'll tell no one except all of our friends\nWe must know\nHow did it end?\n(Uh-oh, uh-oh)\n[Verse 2]\nWe were blind to unforeseen circumstances\nWe learned thе right steps to different dancеs\nAnd fell victim to interlopers' glances\nLost the game of chance, what are the chances?\nSoon, they'll go home to their husbands\nSmug 'cause they know they can trust him\nThen feverishly calling their cousins\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Guess who we ran into at the shops?\nWalking in circles like she was lost\nDidn't you hear? They called it all off\"\nOne gasp and then\n\"How did it end?\"\n[Bridge]\nSay it once again with feeling\nHow the death rattle breathing\nSilenced as the soul was leaving\nThe deflation of our dreaming\nLeaving me bereft and reeling\nMy beloved ghost and me\nSitting in a tree\nD-Y-I-N-G\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's happenin' again\nHow did it end?\nI can't pretend like I understand\nHow did it end?\n[Chorus]\nCome one, come all, it's happenin' again\nThe empathetic hunger descends\nWe'll tell no one except all of our friends\nBut I still don't know\nHow did it end"
