Ooh\n[Chorus]\nAll my senses come to life\nWhile I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I\nHave ever been and I'll never leave again\n'Cause you are the only one\nAnd all my friends have gone to find\nAnother place to let their hearts collide\nJust promise me you'll never leave again now\n'Cause you are the only one\n[Verse 2]\nTake my hand and my heart and soul\nI will only have these eyes for you\nAnd you know everything changes\nBut we'll be strangers if we see this through\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou could stay within these walls and bleed\nOr just stay with me, oh, Lord, now\n[Chorus]\nAll my senses come to life\nWhile I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I\nHave ever been and I'll never leave again\n'Cause you are the only one\nAnd all my friends have gone to find\nAnother place to let their hearts collide\nJust promise me you'll always be a friend now\n'Cause you are the only one\n[Bridge]\nStumblin' half-drunk, gettin' myself lost\nI am so gone, so tell me the way home\nI listen to sad songs, singin' about love\nAnd where it goes wrong\n[Chorus]\nAnd all my senses come to life\nWhile I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I\nHave ever been and I'll never leave again\n'Cause you are the only one\nAnd all my friends have gone to find\nAnother place to let their hearts collide\nJust promise me you'll always be a friend\n'Cause you are the only one"
