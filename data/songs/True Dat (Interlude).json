  "lyrics": "The first of many great spoken word verses by Big Rube to appear on an OutKast album.\n[Interlude: Big Rube]\nOperatin' under the crooked American system too long\nOutKast, pronounced outcast\nAdjective, meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society\nBut let's look deeper than that\nAre you an OutKast?\nIf you understand and feel the basic principles and fundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are\nIf you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac doors\nYou probably a cracker or a nigga that think he a cracker or maybe just don't understand\nAn OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world\nHe's looked at differently\nHe's not accepted because of his clothes, his hair, his occupation, his beliefs, or his skin color\nNow look at yourself\nAre you an OutKast?\nI know I am\nAs a matter of fact, fuck being anything else\nIt's only so much time left in this crazy world\nWake up, niggas, and realize what's going on around you\nPoisonin' of the food and water\nTamperin' of cigarettes\nDisease engineering\nControl over your life\nTake back your existence or die like a punk\nThis is Big Rube, sayin' right on to the real and death to the fakers\nPeace out"
