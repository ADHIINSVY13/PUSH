  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nI miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye\nChop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye\nI hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye\nThe always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye\nI miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye\nI gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye\nSee, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes\nAnd now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes\nI used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye\nI even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye\nWhat if Kanye made a song about Kanye\nCalled \"I Miss the Old Kanye\"? Man, that'd be so Kanye\nThat's all it was, Kanye, we still love Kanye\nAnd I love you like Kanye loves Kanye"
