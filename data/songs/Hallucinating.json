You must be hallucinating\nOh, you did more percs than me? Then you must be hallucinating\nDon't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan\nI seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way\nChanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today\nThat bitch get on my nerves, man, I had to send her out to Saint Tropez\nOh, you done blow more cheques than me, boy? Then you gotta be hallucinating\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up\nThe freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck\n[Verse 1]\nI could turn a stripper to a diva\nChinchilla on her, that's a PETA\nShawty light the gun like Bonita\nRockstars goin' like the Beatles\nI took styrofoams to the meeting\nThree cellphones when you greet me\nGot a bitch waiting in the lounge\nI done had to move a few pounds\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLooking at my chain, don't drown\nAndy put the diamonds in his mouth\nAll bad bitches pop out\nWhen a nigga steppin' out the house\nEvery day we walk the red carpet\nEvery day one of my hoes fallin' in love\n[Chorus]\nI seduce you with this Aston Martin I bought today\nOh, you done did more drugs than me? You must be hallucinating\nOh, you did more percs than me? Then you must be hallucinating\nDon't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan\nI seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way\nChanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today\nThat bitch get on my nerves, man, I had to send her out to Saint Tropez\nOh you done blow more cheques than me, boy? Then you gotta be hallucinating\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up\nThe freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck\n[Verse 2]\nAll I do is pop more bottles and give 'em to you\nAll they ever do is bring more problems than listen to\nMy chains, my ring gon' bling, they do all the seducin'\nI was kickin' shit with yo' bitch, she did all of the choosin'\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLooking at my chain, don't drown\nAndy put the diamonds in his mouth\nAll bad bitches pop out\nWhen a nigga steppin' out the house\nEvery day we walk the red carpet\nEvery day one of my hoes fallin' in love\n[Chorus]\nI seduce you with this Aston Martin I bought today\nOh, you done did more drugs than me? You must be hallucinating\nOh, you did more percs than me? Then you must be hallucinating\nDon't menace over these Vicodins, you must've seen Satan\nI seduce you with this Rolls Royce truck that's on the way\nChanel is on the invoice, I had bought the store today\nThat bitch get on my nerves, man, I had to send her out to Saint Tropez\nOh you done blow more cheques than me, boy? Then you gotta be hallucinating\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm a young nigga with this cheque and I fuck it up\nThe freshest thing that I ever bought was that Bentley truck\n[Outro]\nIt's a lot weighin' on my shoulders\nI ain't ever gon' fold up\nI had turbo'd off my motor\nI was pushin' boulders\nI gave you some closure when I bought the Rover"
