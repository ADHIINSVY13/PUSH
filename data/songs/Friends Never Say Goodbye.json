  "lyrics": "There isn't much I haven't shared\nWith you along the road\nAnd through it all there'd always be\nTomorrow's episode\nSuddenly that isn't true\nThere's another avenue\nBeckoning, the great divide\nAsk no questions, take no side\nWho's to say who's right or wrong\nWhose course is braver run\nStill we are, have always been, will ever be as one\nWhat is done hath been done for the best\nThough the mist in my eyes might suggest\nJust a little confusion about what I'll lose\nBut if I started over I know I would choose\nThe same joy the same sadness each step of the way\nThat fought me and taught me that friends never say\nNever say goodbye\nNever say goodbye\nNever say goodbye\nNever say goodbye\nSuddenly that isn't true\nThere's another avenue\nBeckoning, the great divide\nI would choose\nThe same joy, the same sadness, each step of the way\nThat fought me and taught me that friends never say\nNever say goodbye\nNever say goodbye\nNever say goodbye\nNever say goodbye"
