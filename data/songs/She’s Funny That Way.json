  "lyrics": "I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see\nJust glad I'm livin' and happy to be\nI got a woman, crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nI can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent\nShe'd never holler, she'd live in a tent\nI got a woman, crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nThough she'd love to work and slave for me every day\nShe'd be so much better off if I went away\nBut why should I leave her, why should I go?\nShe'd be unhappy without me, I know\nI got a woman, crazy for me\nShe's funny that way\nWhen I hurt her feelin's once in a while\nHer only answer is one little smile\nI got a woman, crazy for me\nShe's funny that way"
