  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nShe take a shot of Hennessy, I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up\nI do this shit for him and me, I'm the next Lone Star to blow up\nPicture bein' locked in a box, sellin' beats 'cause you need dollars\nThey say I can make it to the league, Mama\nFive hundred dollars, all we need, Mama\nThen we gon' be on\nTired of seeing the lights off\nPops heatin' up the stove\nWas close to stealin' and killin', now just to get 'em on\nCouple\n drinks down of Ros√©\nI'm tipsy, I'm faceless, I look like an emoji\nThe RAV4 turned into a Rover\n'Til it took flight and end up on the shoulder\nNow our money a little longer\nLookin' back how we finessed when we ain't know shit\nThey gave me three, got twenty-five on the low\nWho knew that lump sum would get me on?\nMy fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer\nI can shit all day, diaper\nCall that eat-all-day, itis\nWill I ever fall off? I doubt it\n[Bridge]\nNo, no, no, no, all these diamonds shinin'\nAll this gold on me, all these foes on us\nHow do I dodge these zombies?\nThey want my soul from me\nKnow that I'm gone, but one thing\nThey will never catch me\nFallin' off, fallin' off (Never catch me)\nFallin' off, fallin' off (Never catch me)\nFallin' off, fallin' off (Never catch me)\nFallin' off, fallin' o\nf\nf\n\n[Outro]\nOh-oh-oh (Right)\nOh-oh-oh (Right)\nOh-oh-oh"
