  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI love to watch a woman dance\nShe bows her head and lifts her hands\nHer hips begin to circle slowly\nHer eyes have closed, her face is holy\nShe holds the whole room in trance\n[Chorus]\nI love to watch a woman dance\nYeah, I love to watch a woman dance\n[Verse 2]\nShe likes the slow songs of love lost\nThey take her a million miles away\nCause to dream, sometimes, thatâ€™s the only way\nTo go places you can't get to any other way\nOur eyes connect, she takes my hand\n[Chorus]\nI love to watch a woman dance\nYeah, I love to watch a woman dance\n[Verse 3]\nI feel my heart beating, and I wonder\nWill it ever satisfy my longing?\nI'm going to hold on to you for as long as I can\nCause who knows, this dance may be our only dance\n\n[Bridge]\nSo we dance together, close and slow\nSo slow we're almost standing still\nHer warm breath against my neck\nSlowly breaking down my will\nThe room spins so I can barely stand\nThe song ends and she lets go of my hand\nThere's so much I don't understand\n[Chorus]\nI love to watch a woman dance\nYeah, I love to watch a woman dance"
