Can we just talk?\nTalk about where we're goin'\nBefore we get lost, lend me your thoughts\nFigure out where we're goin'\n[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]\nI got a condo in Manhattan\nBaby girl, what's happenin'? (What's happenin'?)\nYou and your ass invited\nSo go on and get to clappin' (Clap)\nSo pop it for a player\nPop, pop it for me\nTurn around and drop it for a player (Drop it)\nDrop, drop it for me\n[Chorus: Post Malone & \nKhalid\n]\nCan we just talk?\nSeasons change and our love went cold\nFeed the flame 'cause we can't let go\nRun away, but we're running in circles\nRun away, run away, run away\n\n[Verse 3: Khalid]\nStarted off right\nI can see it in your eyes\nI can tell that you'rе wantin' more\nWhat's been on your mind?\nThere's no rеason we should hide\nTell me somethin' I ain't heard before\n[Bridge: Khalid]\nOh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it\nAnd it's you I'm on\nSo stop thinkin' 'bout it\n[Chorus: Post Malone & \nKhalid\n]\nCan we just talk?\nSeasons change and our love went cold\nFeed the flame 'cause we can't let go\nRun away, but we're running in circles\nRun away, run away, run away\nI dare you to do something\nI'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame\nRun away, but we're running in circles\nRun away, run away, run away"
