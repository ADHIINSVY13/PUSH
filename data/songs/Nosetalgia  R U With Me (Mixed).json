  "lyrics": "[Verse: Pusha T]\nTwenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson\nI started out as a baby-faced monster\nNo wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience\nMy teething ring was numbed by that nonsense\nGem Star razor and a dinner plate\nArm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date\nThen crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate\n'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak\nNigga, I was crack in the school zone\nTwo beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned\nFour lockers, four different bitches got they mule on\nBlack Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on\nCouldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches\nWhat I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor\nZhivago, tried to fight the urge\nLike Ivan Drago, \"If he dies, he dies\"\nLike Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides\nThrowin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries\nWe don't drink away the pain when a nigga die\nWe add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh\nWe playin' on a higher game of chess\nOnce you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?\nA million megapixels of the Pyrex\nStarted on the scale, digital my only Timex\nNigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest\nPure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus\nNigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red\nBlood on your diamonds 'til you dyin', dead, yuugh\n\n[Outro]\nYou better change what comes out your speaker\nYou better change, ch-ch-change\nYou better change, ch-ch-change\nYou better change what comes out your speaker\nYou better change\nGo stupid, go stupid, go stupid, do it, go stupid\nGo stupid, go stupid\nDo it clean, do it clean, clean, clean, do it"
