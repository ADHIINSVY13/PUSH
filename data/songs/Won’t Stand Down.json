  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI never believed that I would concede\nAnd let someone trample on me\nYou strung me along, I thought I was strong\nBut you were just gaslightin' me\nI've opened my eyes and counted the lies\nAnd now it is clearer to me\nYou are just a user and an abuser\nLiving vicariously\nI never believed that I would concede\nAnd get myself blown asunder\nYou strung me along, I thought I was strong\nBut now you have pushed me under\nI've opened my eyes and counted the lies\nAnd now it is clearer to me\nYou are just a user and an abuser\nAnd I refuse to take it\n[Chorus]\nWon't stand down, I'm growing stronger\nWon't stand down, I'm owned no longer\nWon't stand down, you've used me for too long\nNow die alone\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm coming back, a counterattack\nI'm playin' you at your own game\nI'm cutting you out, a shadow of doubt\nIs gonna hang over your name\nI've opened my eyes, I see your disguise\nI will never see you the same\nI know how to win before you begin\nI'll shoot you before you take aim\nNow I'm coming back, a counterattack\nA psychological war\nI'm cutting you in, I'm under your skin\nNow I'm gonna settle the score\nI've opened my eyes, I see your disguise\nI will never see you the same\nI know how to win before you begin\nI'll shoot you before you take aim\n\n[Chorus]\nWon't stand down, I'm growing stronger\nWon't stand down, I'm owned no longer\nWon't stand down, you've used me for too long\nNow die alone\n[Breakdown]\nWon't stand down\nBreaking out\nWon't stand down\n[Chorus]\nWon't stand down, I'm growing stronger\nWon't stand down, I'm owned no longer\nWon't stand down, you've used me for too long\nNow die alone\n[Outro]\nWon't stand down\nWon't stand down"
