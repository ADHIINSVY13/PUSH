  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI come from a small town, how 'bout you?\nI only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA\nAnd I want you to come\nEighty miles north or south will do\nI don't care where as long as you're with me\nAnd I'm with you and you let me\n[Chorus]\nLet me love you like a woman\nLet me hold you like a baby\nLet me shine like a diamond\nLet me be who I'm meant to be\nTalk to me in poems and songs\nDon't make me be bittersweet\nLet me love you like a woman\nLet me hold you like a baby\nLet me hold you like a baby\n[Verse 2]\nI come from a small town far away\nI only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA\nAnd I want you to come (And I need you to come)\nI guess I could manage if you stay\nIt's just if you do, I can't see myself having any fun, so\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me love you like a woman\nLet me hold you like a baby\nLet me shine like a diamond\nLet me be who I'm meant to be\nTalk to me in songs and poems\nDon't make me be bittersweet\nLet me love you like a woman\n[Post-Chorus]\nTake you to infinity\nLet me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)\nTake you to infinity\nLet me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)\nTake you to infinity\n[Bridge]\nWe could get lost in the purple rain\nTalk about the good ol' days\nWe could get high on some pink champagne\nBaby, let me count the ways\n[Chorus]\nLet me love you like a woman\nLet me hold you like a baby\nLet me shine like a diamond\nLet me be who I'm meant to be\nTalk to me in songs and poems\nDon't make me be bittersweet\nLet me love you like a woman"
