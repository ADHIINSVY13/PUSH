Cole\n]\nRoll up and smoke my sins away\nI'd like to go to St. Tropez\nMaybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (\nMaybe I'll stay\n)\nShe asked me if I'm scared to fly\nTo tell the truth, I'm terrified\nI never been that high before\nVery bad reason not to go\nTerrible reason not to go\n[Hook: J. Cole & TS]\nHe's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\nHe's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\nShow him the way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\nHe's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nAyy, from the door I showed you my scars\nAnd I told you girl, \"I won't lie-ie-ie\"\nIf we at war, then this is a war\nThat I can't afford, no I, I, I\nI wanted more but that was before\nLord knows I'm torn, so Iâ€“I cry (No I, I, I)\nFrom the corner of my eye, baby\nIt's been hard for me to smile-ile\nLately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile\nLately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile\nLately, it's been hard for me to smile\n\n[Interlude: TS & \nEsther Phillips\n]\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nIf you won't take me in your home\nIf you won't take me in your home\nIf you won't take me in your home\nIf you won't take me in your home\n[Hook: TS]\nHe's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\nHe's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\nShow him the way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood\nHe's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid\nHe's on his way to Hollywood"
