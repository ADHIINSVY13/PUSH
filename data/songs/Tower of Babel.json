  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSnow, cement\nAnd ivory young towers\nSomeone called us Babylon\nThose hungry hunters tracking down the hours\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nBut where were all your shoulders when we cried?\nWere the darlings on the sideline\nDreaming up such cherished lies\nTo whisper in your ear before you die?\n[Chorus]\nIt's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel\nSodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel\nHave a ball y'all\nSee the letches crawl with the call girls under the table\nWatch them dig their graves\n'Cause Jesus don't save the guys\nIn the tower of Babel\nWatch them dig their graves\n'Cause Jesus don't save the guys\nIn the tower of Babel, no, no, no\n[Verse 2]\nJunk, angel\nThis closet's always stacked\nThe dealers in the basement\nFilling your prescription for a brand new heart attack\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBut where were all your shoulders when we cried?\nWere the doctors in attendance\nSaying how they felt so sick inside\nOr was it just the scalpel blade that lied?\n[Chorus]\nIt's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel\nSodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel\nHave a ball y'all\nSee the letches crawl with the call girls under the table\nWatch them dig their graves\n'Cause Jesus don't save the guys\nIn the tower of Babel\nWatch them dig their graves\n'Cause Jesus don't save the guys\nIn the tower of Babel, no, no, no\n[Chorus]\nIt's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel\nSodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel\nHave a ball y'all\nSee the letches crawl with the call girls under the table\nWatch them dig their graves\n'Cause Jesus don't save the guys\nIn the tower of Babel\nWatch them dig their graves\n'Cause Jesus don't save the guys\nIn the tower of Babel, no, no, no"
