  "lyrics": "If you can see me I can see you\nI could wear your new blue shoes\nI should wear your old red dress\nAnd walk to the crossroad, so take this knife\nAnd meet me across the river\nJust chutes and ladders\nAnd this is the kiss\nAmerican anna fantasticalsation\nFrom nowhere to nothing\nAnd neither way back\nChildren swarm like thousands of bugs\nTowards the light\nThe beacons above the hill\nThe stars to the West, the South, the North\nAnd to the East\nNow you can say I've got a gift of sorts\nA fear of rear windows and swinging doors\nMy love of violence and tenants' sighs\nIf you can see me I can see you\nIf you can see me I can see you\nI have seen these bairns wave their fists at God\nSwear to destroy the beast, stamping the ground\nIn their excitement for tomorrow\n\nI could wear your new blue shoes\nI should wear your old red dress\nAnd walk to the crossroad, so take this knife\nAnd meet me across the river\nI \nwill take your lands and all that lays beneath\nThe dust of cold flowers, drizzle of dark ashes\nI will slaughter your kind,\n \ndescend from belief\nI am the spirit of greed, the lord of theft\nBurn all your books and the problems they make\nIf you can see me I can see you\nIf you can see me"
