  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nNow this could only happen to a guy like me\nAnd only happen in a town like this\nSo may I say to each of you most gratefully\nAs I throw each one of you a kiss, this is...\n[Verse 1]\nMy kind of town, Chicago is\nMy kind of town, Chicago is\nMy kind of people, too\nPeople who smile at you\nAnd each time I roam, Chicago is\nCalling me home, Chicago is\nWhy I just grin like a clown\nIt's my kind of town\n[Verse 2]\nMy kind of town, Chicago is\nMy kind of town, Chicago is\nMy kind of razzmatazz\nAnd it has all that jazz\nAnd each time I leave, Chicago is\nTuggin' my sleeve, Chicago is\nThe Wrigley Building, Chicago is\nThe Union Stockyard, Chicago is\nOne town that won't let you down\nIt's my kind of town!"
