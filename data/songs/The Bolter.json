  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBy all accounts, she almost drowned\nWhen she was six in frigid water\nAnd I can confirm she made\nA curious child, ever reviled\nBy everyone except her own father\nWith a quite bewitching face\nSplendidly selfish, charmingly helpless\nExcellent fun 'til you get to know her\nThen she runs like it's a race\nBehind her back, her best mates laughed\nAnd they nicknamed her \"The Bolter\"\n[Chorus]\nStarted with a kiss\n\"Oh, we must stop meeting like this\"\nBut it always ends up with a town car speeding\nOut the drive one evening\nEnded with the slam of a door\nThen he'll call her a whore\nWish he wouldn't be sore\nBut as she was leaving\nIt felt like breathing\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll her fuckin' lives\nFlashed before her eyes\nIt feels like the time\nShe fell through the ice\nThen came out alive\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was a cad, wanted her bad\nJust like any good trophy hunter\nAnd she liked the way it tastes\nTaming a bear, making him care\nWatching him jump then pulling him under\nAnd at first blush, this is fate\nWhen it's all roses, portrait poses\nCentral Park Lake in tiny rowboats\nWhat a charming Saturday\nThat's when she sees the littlest leaks\nDown in the floorboards\nAnd she just knows she must bolt\n[Chorus]\nStarted with a kiss\n\"Oh, we must stop meeting like this\"\nBut it always ends up with a town car speeding\nOut the drive one evening\nEnded with the slam of a door\nThen he'll call her a whore\nWish he wouldn't be sore\nBut as she was leaving\nIt felt like breathing\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll her fuckin' lives\nFlashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)\nIt feels like the time\nShe fell through the ice\nThen came out alive\n\n[Bridge]\nShe's been many places with\nMen of many faces\nFirst, they're off to the races\nAnd she's laughing, drawin' aces\nBut none of it is changin'\nThat the chariot is waitin'\nHearts are hers for the breakin'\nThere's escape in escaping\n[Chorus]\nStarted with a kiss\n\"Oh, we must stop meeting like this\"\nBut it always ends up with a town car speeding\nOut the drive one evening\nEnded with the slam of a door\nBut she's got the best stories\nYou can be sure\nThat as she was leaving\nIt felt like freedom\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll her fuckin' lives\nFlashed before her eyes (And she realized)\nIt feels like the time\nShe fell through the ice\nThen came out alive"
