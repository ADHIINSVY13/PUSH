(Ooh)\nHard to think when I'm under you\nTell you all of my dirty truths\nNo shit, got me right where you want me, baby\nCould I be more obvious?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon\nIf you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon\nMaybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)\nI love the thought of you never leavin' (No)\nDays repeatin'\nGettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'\nNever thought I'd believe in love again\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOthers that I've had had to impress me before (Ooh)\nBut I knew you were the real thing\nWhen you walked through the door\nI didn't think that I would have to spell it out\n[Chorus]\nDon't put the bands, put the bands on me\nOh, my love, oh, my love is free\nAin't no price on my loyalty\nNo shit, got me right where you want me, baby\nCould I be more obvious? (Ooh)\nHard to think when I'm under you\nTell you all of my dirty truths\nNo shit, got me right where you want me, baby\nCould I be more obvious? (Obvious)"
