But anyways\nI read a history book, but I ain't learned nothin', dawg\nSo I read the Bible, then the holy Quran\nWent to Jamaica to acquire my knowledge\nSat with some Rastas 'til my game got polished\nThe gangbang extreme with malice\nTrees and degrees like I'm trained for college\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nThey tryna keep us from runnin' up\nI never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up\n[Chorus: Slick Rick]\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) No apology, equality\n(\nStand up for your rights\n) Youth is future, lets move forward\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) Healthy mentality helps sanity\n(\nStand up for your rights\n) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) Facts half backwards and inaccurate\n(\nStand up for your rights\n) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) Good over evil, deceitful\n(\nDon't give up the fight\n) Morals, principles, it's simple, son\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) No apology, equality\n(\nStand up for your rights\n) Youth is future, lets move forward\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) Healthy mentality helps sanity\n(\nStand up for your rights\n) Melting Pot, help us up, vote or not\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) Facts half backwards and inaccurate\n(\nStand up for your rights\n) Tell folks no backin' up, track it up\n(\nGet up, stand up\n) Good over evil, deceitful\n(\nDon't give up the fight\n) Morals, principles, it's simple, son"
