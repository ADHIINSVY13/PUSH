  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIt's safe in the city\nTo love in a doorway\nTo wrangle some screams from the dawn\nAnd isn't it me\nPutting pain in a stranger?\nLike a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash\nWill you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?\nSo I'll break up my room, and yawn and I\nRun to the centre of things\nWhere the knowing one says:\n[Chorus]\n\"Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing\nBoys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing\nIf you want it, boys, get it here, thing\nFor hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing\"\n[Verse 2]\nI'm glad that you're older than me\nMakes me feel important and free\nDoes that make you smile, isn't that me?\nI'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment\nIf this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you\nAnd turn to the crossroads\n of \nHamburg\n, as in\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Boys, Boys, it's a sweet thing\nBoys, Boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing\nIf you want it, boys, get it here, thing\nFor hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing\""
