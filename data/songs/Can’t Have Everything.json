Tell me who I gotta down\nI'll do a song now, man\nEven though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man\nEverything that went around is comin' back around\nY'all better hit the ground\nGoddamn, beef forever unfinished\nYeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute\nHad you all since beginnin'\nDamn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them\nCan you not see the difference?\nI mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'\nMan, my record deal should be five-houndred million, goddamn\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nCan't have everything, can't have everything\nWant a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nFinally got my mind in a free state\nNiggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak\nI gave them back a clean plate\nSame niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight\nSame niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates\nThat's when the phone starts ringin', like, \"Are we straight?\"\nTwo-faced niggas back around with the three-face, damn\nOl' triple-double-Russ face, watch-with-the bust face\nNever-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face\nNever-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face\nY'all fuckin' hilarious\nY'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us\nY'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton\nAll that shit embarrassin'\nTell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again\nHe ain't even die, and I ball with his inheritance\nAll that's in my account at the Bank of America\nAll that Drake hysteria\n6 side, East side, all that for my area\n[Outro: Sandi Graham]\nYou know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days\nAnd I, I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from\nAnd you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel\nAs well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust\nBut that attitude will just hold you back in this life\nAnd you're going to continue to feel alienated\nGive some thought to this, because I'm confident in you\nAnd I know that you can reach your desired destination\nAnd accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation that I'm hearing in your tone these days\nWhen others go low, we go high"
