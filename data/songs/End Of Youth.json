  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI've been depressed since you left, tried to fill the hole with wine\nStopped the drugs when she came, cleaned my act up overnight\nIf you reach with no reply, I'll see you when I see you, man\nYou can't talk me through the fall if we don't know if I can land\nTried to grow, but the past, it tears me down to size\nTell the world how to process, but don't take the same advice\nHalf remember what I say, then the morning's filled with fear\nCan't get a handle on my grief when every memory turns to tears\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's been a long year\nAnd we're not even halfway there\n[Chorus]\nIs this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?\nI just don't know if I can ever just let it go\nEverything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure\nI guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low\n[Post-Chorus]\nWe spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open\nAnd then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth\n[Verse 2]\nI've been lost since the teens, but pretend it's all alright\nAll my ups led to falls that led to trying to end my life\nJust a boy at the start, they lent on like a man\nYou were meant to be my friend and not to take all that you can\nDisengaged to create, try to reinvent the wheel\nNo one knows what they want, so I just give you what I feel\nIf I slip and get high, I know the low is always near\nWhen I'm down, I never see you, when I'm up, you all appear\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's been a long year\nAnd we're not even halfway there\n[Chorus]\nIs this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?\nI just don't know if I can ever just let it go\nEverything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure\nI guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low\n[Post-Chorus]\nWe spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open\nAnd then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth\n[Bridge]\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's been a long year\nAnd we're not even halfway there\n[Chorus]\nIs this the endin' of our youth when pain starts takin' over?\nI just don't know if I can ever just let it go\nEverything's fallin' apart, when love is real, there's never closure\nI guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but feel low\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWe spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open\nAnd then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth\nWe spend our youth with arms and hearts wide open\nAnd then the dark gets in and that's the end of youth"
