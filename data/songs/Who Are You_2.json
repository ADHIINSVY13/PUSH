Rap Brown, I'm Muhammad Ali\nI'm Reginald Lewis, George Washington Carver\nI'm Nas with incredible music\n, \nlet's do it\nThinking of a master plan\nSipping on disaster, smoking on gangster\nWatching niggas argue, chillin' on my bar-stool\nWith my \nHell Up in Harlem\n hat in hand\nWith a girl named Pat\nShe more than a waitress to order your drink with\nShe divorced a banker and bought the bar\nShe got an automobile, she give an order to kill\nYou get caught and robbed, we could see your walk is off\nYou could lose your rhythm when you outta the gutter for a while\nYou easily go to soft from hard\nNow we all about hustlers, number runners\n, hoes and sharks\nAnd we all know the code of the block\nAnd you talking some gibberish, anti-nigga shit\n'Cause you marched back with Rosa Parks?\nBrother, don't start, go build your Noah's Ark\nYou could float to the end of the world, and pretend what you not\nBut I know what you are\nWhile I roll in my car, and I'm spending my knot\nWhile my enemies plot, you ain't out of the shot\nMatter of fact, you're an easier target\nAnd I respect everything you accomplished\nBut I hope I never get old and talk that nonsense\nSo who the fuck are you?\n\n[Chorus: David Rainer]\nWho are you, tryna tell me who I am?\nTryna tell me who I am?\nWho are you, tryna tell me what I'm not?\nTryna tell me what I'm not\nWho are you, tryna tell me who I am?\nTryna box me in, tryna find who I am\n[Outro: Nas]\nShe Queen of Nzinga\nWinnie Mandela\n, \nIda B. Wells\nWhy can't you tell?\nWhy can't you tell?"
