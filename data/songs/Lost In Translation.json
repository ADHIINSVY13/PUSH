(Me now)\nFeel like I'm lost in translation\nTell me do you feel me now\nFeel like I'm lost in translation\nCan you feel me now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nLondon is far from here\nMy boy\nNo, he ain't near\nTime flies, passin' by\nAnother day, alone tonight\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI never say, how I feel\n(No, no, no)\nNo I never lie\nNo I never lie\nBut I rarely tell\nTell the truth\n(No, no, no)\nAnd you ask me why\nAnd you ask me why\n[Chorus]\nIf I keep it real?\n(Feel like I'm lost in translation)\nHoney will you feel me now?\nCan I keep it real?\n(Feel like I’m lost in translation)\nTell me do you feel me now? (Me now)\nTill' I got lost in translation\nTell me do you feel me now?\nFeel like I'm lost in translation\nCan you feel me now? (Me now, me now, me now, me now)"
