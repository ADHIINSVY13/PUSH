  "lyrics": "This was Logic’s freestyle for the 2013 XXL Freshman class. It was release on April 15th\n[Verse]\nSee, I’m a motherfucking lyricist, bitches, they fearing us\nBack in the day, they wasn't hearing this, now I’m the one who’s steering this\nI’m self-driven, will he kill it? That’s a lyrical given\nNew school style, but the '90s is where my lyrics living\nMy flow is like another Earth, second nature\nI disintegrate ya, migrate ya, then light-saber decapitate ya\nIn the beginning, they said it was fabricated, as soon as the numbers escalated\nBut these fuckers just mad that I made it\nMore chains than when a slave traded, check it\nI’m under MCs' skin like muscle tissue, what’s the issue?\nIf you talking shit, then I'ma hit you\nGrab a pistol, then whip you, then dip you in lava, ain’t no one ‘liver\nSecond I arrive, I murder it, no, you never heard of it\nSo sick, my lyrics, I don’t spit, I regurgitate them\nAs listeners chronologically study my words verbatim\nAssassinate 'em, the second I raid them like five-0\nWe pull off the heist and flee to Cabo now\nI mask emotions like a robbery\n'Cause when it comes to matters of the heart, women will clog your arteries\nVisionary, V’s up, RattPack\nYoung Sinatra, Maryland's what I'm reppin'\nConceal the flow behind the image like a murder weapon"
