  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days\nHe says, \"Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?\"\nHe spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be\nHe spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI call, just checkin' up on him\nHe's up, 3AM, pacin'\nHe says, \"\nIt's not just a phase I'm in\n\"\nMy voice comes out beggin'\n[Chorus]\nAll this time, I didn't know\nYou were breakin' down\nI'd fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you weren't around\nToo young to know it gets better\nI'll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\n[Verse 2]\nHe seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds\nHis laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe\nI pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head\nLive my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI call, just checkin' up on him\nHe's up, 5AM, wasted\nLong gone, not even listening\nMy voice comes out screamin'\n[Chorus]\nAll this time, I didn't know\nYou were breakin' down\nI'd fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you weren't around\nToo young to know it gets better\nI'll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\n[Bridge]\nIf I was standing there in your apartment\nI'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it\nI'd say, \"I love you even at your darkest and\nPlease, don't go\"\n[Chorus]\nI didn't know\nYou were breakin' down\nI'd fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you weren't around\nToo young to know it gets better\nI'll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nI'll be your summer sun forever\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 3AM, pacin'\nAll this time, I didn't know\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 5AM, wasted\nI'd be in pieces on the floor\nForever winter if you go\n[Outro]\nHe says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days\nI say, \"Believe in one thing, I won't go away\""
