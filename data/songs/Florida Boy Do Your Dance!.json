  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI know I sell myself short, lookin' at the ceiling fan\nSpin around again and again\nThis repetition got me stuck in a trance, big Glock in my pants\nFlorida boy, do your dance, yeah, I made me some bands\nYeah, I got me a Benz, yeah, I got me a chain\nAnd I still feel the same, and I still feel insane\nI put on for these rappers, I think I'm changing the game\nBut if they don't feel the same, then fuckin' get in my lane\nAnd see if you can get the crowd movin' for you the same\nAnd see if you can get the crowd movin' for you the same, yeah\n[Chorus]\nIs this it? Is that all? Got my back to the wall\nAs I'm lookin' around, anticipatin' my fall\nSearchin' for answers but stuck with these questions\nIs somebody tryna teach me a new lesson?\n[Post-Chorus]\nIs this it?\nIs that all?\nIs this it?\nIs that all?\n[Verse 2]\nHow long should I wait until I move on?\nBack to the air mattress and the coupons\nI realize it'll never be enough for me\nWhat do I gotta do to live comfortably?\nI think I'd give it back if it was up to me\nMy mind's not movin' like it's 'posed to be\nThese labels need to really back off of me\nI really don't care what they offer me\nOkay, now you talkin' money, I guess you do speak my language\nI don't give a fuck who you is or who you hang with\nBaby Bone, no, I never been the one to stay silent\nEverybody, grab your guns, let's start a riot\nAre you so sick and tired of these men in your pockets\nThat never even left the office but promise to give you just what you wanted?\nOh no, now they got you stuck in a financial coffin\nNow you gotta pay 'em back with every cent of your profit"
