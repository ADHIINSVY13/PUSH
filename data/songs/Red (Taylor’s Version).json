  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLoving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street\nFaster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly\nLoving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall\nLike the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all\n[Chorus]\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)\nForgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met\nBut loving him was red (Red, red)\n(Red, red)\nBut loving him was red (Red, red)\n(Red, red)\n[Verse 2]\nTouching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you\nMemorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song\nFighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer\nRegretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong\n[Chorus]\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)\nForgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met\nBut loving him was red (Red, red)\nOh, red (Red, red)\nBurning red (Red, red)\n(Red, red)\n\n[Bridge]\nRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes\nTell myself it's time now, gotta let go\nBut moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head\nIn burning red\nBurning, it was red\n[Chorus]\nOh, losing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)\nForgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met\n'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)\nYeah, yeah, red (Red, red)\nOh, burning red (Red, red)\n(Red, red)\n[Post-Chorus]\nAnd that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)\nComes back to me, burning red (Red, red)\n(Red, red)\nYeah, yeah (Red, red)\n[Outro]\nHis love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street"
