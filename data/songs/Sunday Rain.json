A little alone?\nA little exhausted?\nDo you give it away? (Do you give it away?) Do you let go? (Do you let go?)\nWhere do you find it? Oh\n[Chorus]\nDon't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain\nIt's right down the drain I go\nDon't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain\nIt's always a shame, oh no\nDon't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain\nIt's right down the drain I go\nDon't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain\nIt's always a shame, oh no\n[Outro]\nA little afraid? A little alone?\nA little exhausted?\nDo you give it away? Try to let go?\nHow do you find it? Oh\nA little afraid? A little alone?\nA little exhausted?\nDo you give it away? Do you let go?\nHow do you find it?\nA little afraid? A little alone?\nA little exhausted?\nGive it away? You let go?\nOh"
