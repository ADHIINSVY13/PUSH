  "lyrics": "[Spoken Word]\nThis song is a big bummer. It's really... about how... everybody dies. You can’t change it, and it's a horrible thought. But it's also a comforting thought? I don’t know, it, like, gives me comfort to know I'm gonna die, I don't know why. I talked a, I've talked about it since I was a kid. Makes me feel... happy that all things end. It's also very sad and sentimental. This song is really just about knowing that you only have so long to do what you want, so just do it and... enjoy your life."
