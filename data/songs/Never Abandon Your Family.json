  "lyrics": "[Intro: Donda West]\nTwo lessons that he passed along to his children\nThe first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\nThe second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionally\nIt is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is\nHe vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nYou know why my spirit's callin'\nDarkness can't take light from me\nHaven't you gone far enough?\nSacrificed the ones you love\nGave up on your sanity\nLike some twisted fantasy\nWhat would I say to everything?\nYour actions cost everything\n[Refrain: Kanye West]\nMy, my, my family\nMy family, I'm losing my family\nI'm losing my family\nLosing my family\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nCried out to you in my sleep, you thought it was a dream\n\"Why won't you answer me? I'm in the room\"\n\"Tell mom you're sorry,\" she's screaming at me\n\"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?\"\n\"Come back tonight, daddy, please, come back tonight, daddy, please\"\n\"Daddy, how could you leave? Daddy, how could you leave?\"\nShe don't know what this means, \"How'd you become so mean?\"\nI wish I never screamed, alcohol when you breathe\nThese things, these things, these things, these things, they sting\n\"Daddy, promise you'll stay, don't you love me? Love me\"\n\n[Outro: Donda West]\nTwo lessons that he passed along to his children\nThe first -is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\n-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\n-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\n-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\n-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\n-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\n-Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family\nIt is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is\nHe vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has"
