  "lyrics": "“Yours” is an unreleased song by Dua Lipa that has a lighter feel reminiscent of her earlier music. It’s a borderline power anthem that talks about how bad she wants to be in a relationship with someone.\n[Verse 1]\nWhat are we waiting for?\nAre you in or out?\nFinally, I can see what my heart needs now\nI believe you and me\nWe can work somehow\nEh-eh-eh-eh\nHold my hand\nTake a risk 'til it all falls down\nIs it a sin to commit?\nIf so, help me now\nWhat's a day without a kiss?\nCan we live out loud?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll we ever do is night time lately\nI've been waiting for a lifetime for too long\nI've been waiting for the right time, baby\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be yours (\nHey\n)\nI wanna be everything you ever dreamed of\nI wanna be yours (\nOoh-hoo\n)\nAre you lookin' at anybody else?\nBecause I wanna be yours\n(\nI wanna be\n) yours\n(\nI wanna, wanna be)\n yours\nI wanna be yours\nHoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeel the rush when we touch\nElectricity\nFeel the heat, light me up\nOne hundred degrees\nThis is more than the crush\nIt was meant to be\n(Eh-eh-ah-eh)\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll we ever do is night time lately\nI've been waiting for a lifetime for too long\nI've been waiting for the right time, baby\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be yours (\nHey\n)\nI\n wanna be everything you ever dreamed of\nI wanna be yours (\nOoh-hoo\n)\nA\nre you lookin' at anybody else?\nBecause I wanna be yours\n(\nI wanna be\n) yours\n(\nI wanna, wanna be) yourY\nI wanna be yours\nHoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh\n[Bridge]\nI don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that\nFavorite drunken call\nOh, say you will be mine\nSay you will be mine\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be yours (\nHey\n)\nI\n wanna be everything you ever dreamed of\nI wanna be yours (\nOoh-hoo\n)\nA\nre you lookin' at anybody else?\nBecause I wanna be yours\n(\nI wanna be) yourY\n(\nI wa\nnna, wanna be) yourY\nI wanna be yours\nHoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh"
