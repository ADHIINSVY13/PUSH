I'm thirsty\n[Verse 1]\nBig slam\n, quick slam, tin can, whatever\nWhether too cold or too hot, you got\nTo keep Pepsi in the freezer, I keep a 3 liter for my crew\nMy girl like them diet joints too\nFor when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait\nOther sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse\nIf it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?\nWhat you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth\nHot like the south, flash out your 12 ounce and renounce\nNothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i\nYes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case,\n \ntastes great, less filling\nNon-alcoholic I can feed it to my children\nTell em Biggie said, \"Drink it all\"; don't test me!\nNothing else beats a Pepsi, if it is, let's see\nI'm thirsty"
