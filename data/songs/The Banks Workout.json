Nigga, ain't nothin' change\nYou move, I'll blow your brains\n[Verse: Lloyd Banks & \n50 Cent\n]\nThese niggas don't really want war (nah)\nThey just walk around frontin' 'cause I walk around stuntin'\nWhy you think the long pump is in the trunk for? (\nYeah\n)\nIf you really want something, we can show up at your front door\nI know my history—my family tree done said \"master\" (\nUh-huh\n)\nAnd fuck livin' positive 'cause negativity spreads faster (\nYeah\n)\nA celebrity has to bulletproof his car\n'Cause big-heads come flyin' through your door like Casper (\nWoo\n)\nI'm smokin' out the jar (Jar)\n scopin' out the bar\nDistracted—see shorty' breast pokin' out the bra (\nUh-huh\n)\nNot the type to go spark metal and—\nStart thinkin' you gangsta 'cause you hit a parked yellow van\n (\nYeah\n)\nAct hard but your heart made of marshmallows, man\nTalk tough until you get cuffed and start tellin'—damn\nEvery day, I got a new bitch, and when I'm done with her—\nIt'll look like she dived headfirst into Cool Whip (\nGoddamn\n)\nYou only gon wind up dead tryna prove shit\nI put chalk around your head like a pool stick (\nYeah\n)\nI gotta have bucks on the waist\nI'm hungry like a South African with flies stuck to his face (\nWaa\n)\nCatch Banks in a truck full of bass (\nUh-huh\n)\nRemember, I'm a bachelor—the four or five ducks gotta space\nYou could either get bust or get your ass jumped\nThe only trigger you touch is on the gas pump\nI got my own personal slave—she really got a curfew\nCook and clean for the kid like Celie in \"Color Purple\"\n (\nUh-huh, uh\n)\nI know you wanna pop me, but— (But)\nIf I hit you first, the exit wound gon' be the size of a hockey puck (\nAh\n)\nFuck, I really hold the rubber\nI send sparks at you, and I don't mean Omillio or Bubba\nI'm aimin' for a video or cover, huge tour-buses\nA pound and a Philly, hold the smuggler\nG-Unit's what's up right now\nThe Gucci cloth is on a Newport sign upside-down\nYou gotta come a lil' harder—nigga, you wear jerseys?\nWell, mine is a throwback, and yours is a Starter (\nHahaha\n)\nYou still gotta beg a ho (Ho)\nAnd you mad 'cause you blowin' on oregano\nYou niggas'll never blow\nAnyone to step in my ring is brave\nI don't know a thing about hairstyling, but I can make a finger weave (\nErr\n)\nShort stay, leave her butt in the telly\nLace up the beef-and-broccolis, peanut butter-and-jelly\nI'm about to get this deal (\nUh-huh\n), and shorty know\nThats why she foamin' out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill\nI ain't loud around a snitch (\nNah\n), I don't crowd around a bitch (\nNah\n)\nThe jumpsuit match with the Carolina kicks\nI been sick since niggas was on Harold Miner's dick\nI could call up a chick and put a child around her lips (\nWoo\n)\nNiggas can't stand the fact that I'm real (\nHe's off, nigga\n)\nI kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill\nGimme Barbie at her best (\nUh-huh\n), Bacardi at the chest (\nUh-huh\n)\nI'm similar to the young Marcus Garvey at the desk\nUsed to have to push up; now, I hardly got to press\nGot two guns, and both lead to cardiac arrest (Ugh)\nMy success got suckers salty (Salty)\nBlowin' steam like a cup of coffee\nClick, pow! Get these fuckers off me\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nI hear a lot of talkin'\nNiggas must be mad at Banks\nBut there's only one problem\nNiggas ain't as bad as Banks\nNigga, youse front, you gon' get shot down (Shot, nigga)\nWe finna pump crack at your spot now\nG-Unit! Nigga, ain't nuttin change\nYou move, I'll blow your brains\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nYeah!\nLloyd Banks, nigga!\nWhat's up, nigga?\nIt's 50, nigga!\nYou fuckin' wit him, right?\nI know you fuckin' wit him 'cause I said you'd fuckin' wit him! That's my baby right there, that's my boy right there, my young nigga\nWhat's up nigga?\nThe fuck!\nI hear niggas hollerin that\n\"Keep it real\" and all that, nigga!\nNigga, nigga talkin' all that gangsta shit!\nNigga, we get it poppin', nigga!\nWhat's up, nigga?\nAnytime nigga, I don't give a fuck if it's 4 in the afternoon, nigga!\nAnywhere you see me, nigga!\nLet's go!"
