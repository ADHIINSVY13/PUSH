(Ah-ah)\nI need somethin' that'll make me believe (Ah-ah)\nIf you got it, baby, give it to me\n[Refrain]\nWeave the ceilin' from tomorrow\nFree the people from daylight\nAll the plans go out the window\nWhen we're out this late at night\n[Chorus]\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIf you're good enough, you'll find the way\nMaybe you could cause a girl to change her ways\nDo you think about it night and day?\nMaybe you could be the one to make me stay\n[Breakdown]\n(Oh-oh, ooh)\n(Maybe you could be the one to make me stay)\n(Time is passin' like a solar eclipse)\n(See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss)\n(Baby, don't let it slip)\n(Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?)\n(They say)\n(Ooh)\n[Chorus]\nI come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me (Ooh)\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n\n[Refrain]\nWeave the ceilin' from tomorrow\nFree the people from daylight\nAll the plans go out the window\nWhen we're out this late at night\n[Chorus]\nThey say I come and I go\nTell me all the ways you need me\nI'm not here for long\nCatch me or I go Houdini\nI come and I go (I come and I go)\nProve you got the right to please me\nEverybody knows (I'm not here for long)\nCatch me or I go Houdini\n[Outro]\nHoudini\nHoudini\nHoudini\nCatch me or I go Houdini"
