  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe wavelength gently grows\nCoercive notions re-evolve\nA universe is trapped inside a tear\nIt resonates the core, creates unnatural laws\nReplaces love and happiness with fear, ooh\n[Chorus]\nHow much deception can you take?\nHow many lies will you create?\nHow much longer till you break?\nYour mind's about to fall\n[Bridge]\nAnd they're breaking through\nAnd they're breaking through\nThey're breaking through\n(We are losing control)\nThey're breaking through\nThey're breaking through\nThey're breaking through\nNow we're falling\nWe are losing control\n[Verse 2]\nInvisible to all\nThe mind becomes a wall\nAll of history deleted with one stroke, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nHow much deception can you take?\nHow many lies will you create?\nHow much longer till you break?\nYour mind's about to fall\n[Outro]\nAnd they're breaking through\nThey're breaking through\nThey're breaking through\nNow we're falling\nWe are losing control"
