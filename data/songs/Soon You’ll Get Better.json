  "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]\nThe buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair\nIn doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared\nThat was the first time we were there\nHoly orange bottles, each night, I pray to you\nDesperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too\nAnd I say to you\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nYou'll get better soon\n'Cause you have to\n[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]\nI know delusion when I see it in the mirror\nYou like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal\nI just pretend it isn't real\nI'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky\nI know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try\nAnd I say to you\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nYou'll get better soon\n'Cause you have to\n\n[Bridge: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]\nAnd I hate to make this all about me\nBut who am I supposed to talk to?\nWhat am I supposed to do\nIf there's no you?\n[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]\nThis won't go back to normal, if it ever was\nIt's been years of hoping and I keep saying it because\n'Cause I have to\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Chicks]\nOoh-ah\nYou'll get better\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nYou'll get better soon\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nSoon, you'll get better\nOoh-ah\nYou'll get better soon\n'Cause you have to"
