  "lyrics": "Here today, gone tomorrow\nWon't be your friend until the end of time\nToo much pain, and too much sorrow\nThe reasons out the door\nI’ve lost my mind\nTime was standing still\nUntil I jumped off the hill\nThe mountain was much higher than I thought\nAnd now the wind is in my hair\nNo borders anywhere\nAnd time is rolling by\nThe clouds are over me like flies\nAnd I can't even cry\nThough I try and I try\nHere today, gone tomorrow\nI'm a lesson learned inside a lie\nDon’t you say that it's so far, oh oh\nJust hold my hand once more\nUntil I fly\n\nIf I found an ocean\nThat was as deep enough for me\nCrawling my way home\nI'll find my way to the sea\nAnd now the wind is in my hair\nNo borders anywhere\nAnd time is rolling by\nThe clouds are over me like flies\nAnd I can't even cry\nThough I try and I try\nHere today and gone tomorrow\nIf I scream it won't make a sound\nHere today and gone tomorrow\nI'll be lost until my heart is found\nOoooh...."
