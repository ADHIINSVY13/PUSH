  "lyrics": "“Doing It Wrong” is soft, low-tempo, break-up ballad with a harmonica solo from the legendary Stevie Wonder.\n\nThe song interpolates Don McLean’s 1977 song “The Wrong Thing To Do.”\n[Verse 1]\nWhen a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world\nIt's just the end of a world that you had with one girl\nAnd she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting\nAnd it's all because she don't want things to change\n[Chorus]\nSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTouch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTalk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\n'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying\nAnd say, \"I love you too\"\n[Refrain]\nBut I need someone different\nYou know it, oh, you know it\nOh, you know it, we both know it\nI need someone different\nYou know it, oh, you know it\nOh, you know it, we both know it\nSomething's been missing\nYou know it, oh, she knows it\nOh, I know it, we all know it\nI need someone different\nOh, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe live in a generation of not being in love and not being together\nBut we sure make it feel like we're together\n'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else\n[Chorus]\nSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTouch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTalk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\n'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying\nAnd say, \"I love you too\"\n[Refrain]\nBut I need someone different\nYou know it, oh, you know it\nOh, you know it, we both know it\nI need someone different\nYou know it, oh, you know it\nOh, you know it, we both know it\nSomething's been missing\nYou know it, oh, she knows it\nOh, I know it, we all know it\nI need someone different\nOh, oh\n\n[Outro: Stevie Wonder on Harmonica]"
