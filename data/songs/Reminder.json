Silver bullet, hard top Ben-t-ley\nThey think I'm out of shape, so I have to jog they memory\nThink with indelible ink, I let the pen go\nVerses permanently tattooed, serve as mementos\nUgh, I'm so mental\nMy track record speaks for itself, I'm so instrumental\nAllow me to rekindle, let's all \nReminisce\n like Mary did\nI think I have to send you a reminder, here it is\n[Chorus: K. Briscoe & \nJay-Z\n]\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI got it if you needed a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI think I better give you a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI got it if you needed a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\n'Cause I can give you a friendly reminder (\nuhh\n)\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nWhat the hell have y'all done?\nTo even heav-an opinion on what I've been doin'\nWhat the hell have y'all won?\nOnly thing you can identify with is losing\nTen number one albums in a row, who better than me?\nOnly The Beatles, nobody ahead of me\nI crush Elvis and his Blue Suede Shoes\nMade the Rolling Stones seem sweet as Kool-Aid too\n'96,\n \n'97,\n \n'98,\n \n'99\n2000,\n \n2001\n \nand beyond\n'02,\n \n'03,\n \n'04, '05\n'06 and 7,\n '\n08,\n \n'09\nBack-to-back, double plat', I did what you won't\nMen lie, women lie, numbers don't\nAin't nothin' changed for, me 'cept the year it is\nI think I have to send you a reminder, here it is\n[Chorus: K. Briscoe & \nJay-Z\n]\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI got it if you needed a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI think I better give you a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI got it if you needed a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\n'Cause I can give you a friendly reminder (\nuhh\n)\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nDo what I've done without cryin'\nIn the environment in which I did it in without dyin', my nigga\nThen rap like I rap without lyin'\nThen tie 'em both together like I am, my nigga\nThen write sixteens in between runnin' sixteen bid'nesses\nAll the while showin' these young punks what the bid'ness is\nAs if, I'ma let you niggas style on me\nAs if, now everybody's senile on me\nThrowbacks, I threw 'em back, remember those, button-ups?\nYoung Hov,\n \ntell them ordinary Joe's button up\nI destroy your 4.0's\nAnd Benz 500's it all points to oh!\nNow you niggas 'member me? Tell me how could you forget\nBack of Johnny's album cover, red and blue Gucci shit\nAin't nothin' changed but the year it is\nI think I have to send you a reminder, here it is\n[Chorus: K. Briscoe & \nJay-Z\n]\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI got it if you needed a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI think I better give you a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\nI got it if you needed a reminder (\nuhh\n)\nReminder (\nuhh\n), reminder (\nuhh\n)\n'Cause I can give you a friendly reminder (\nuhh\n)"
