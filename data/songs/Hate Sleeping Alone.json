  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe says, \"Kiss me like you miss me\nFuck me like you hate me\nAnd when you're fuckin' someone else\nJust fuck her like she ain't me\"\nDamn, those words are scary\nThose words are scary, Virgin Mary\nI just tell her to spare me\nI was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex\nIt's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry\nI hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?\nI get off-topic, don't I? I get it poppin', don't I?\nI'll end up stoppin', won't I?\nAnd by the time I end up stoppin'\nYou'll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin' with a nigga, don't lie\nUh, she's losin' it right now\n'\nCause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now\nBut instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now\nAnd she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now\nBut this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now\nYou just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh\n[Chorus]\nI say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around\nSo I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down\n'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone\nHalf the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing\nYou leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months\nBut I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone\nSo she's here and we're both so gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nHotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company\nFull name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me\nBut she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me\nIf she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me\nYou say that you're over me, you always end up under me\nYou know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me\nDon't start with your shit, I put you back in your place\nShe tells me, \"I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face\"\nAnd hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?\nLike I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?\nAnd\n \nwhoever I be with, they got nothing on you\nThat's just something to do when there's nothing to do\nYeah, but she's losing it right now\nShe has choices she should make, I think she's choosing it right now\nOne more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now\nYou just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now, oh\n[Chorus]\nI say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around\nSo I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down\n'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone\nHalf the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing\nYou leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months\nBut I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone\nSo she's here and we're both so gone\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nShe's here, we're so gone\nOh\nOh"
