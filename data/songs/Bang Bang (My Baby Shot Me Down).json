  "lyrics": "I was five and she was six\nWe rode on horses made of sticks\nI wore black and she wore white\nShe would always win the fight\nBang bang, she shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me down\nSeasons came and changed the time\nAnd we grew up, I called her mine\nShe would always laugh and say\n\"Remember when we used to play?\"\n\"Bang bang, I shot you down\"\n\"Bang bang, you hit the ground\"\n\"Bang bang, that awful sound\"\n\"Bang bang, I used to shoot you down\"\nMusic played and people sang\nJust for me the church bells rang\nNow she's gone, I don't know why\nAnd till this day, sometimes I cry\nShe didn't even say \"goodbye\"\nShe didn't take the time to lie\n\nBang bang, she shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me down"
