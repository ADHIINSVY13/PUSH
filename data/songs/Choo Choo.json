Alex describes his girlfriendâ€™s intentions and his intentions on their relationship.\n[Verse 1]\nMy baby wants to drive the train\nBut don't you let her\nWell, don't you let her touch the tracks\nI said, my baby wants to drive the train\nWell, all aboard, yeah\nAnd don't forget to mind the gap\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, don't you let her\nDon't you know\nShe's sick and tired of\nBeing in the background\nThe passenger\nLet her drive the train, oh\n[Chorus]\nChoo-choo!\nWhy don't you let her drive the train? Oh\nChoo-choo!\nWhy don't you let her drive the train? Yeah\n[Verse 2]\nShe's setting off from platform four\nWell, make your way down\nWe'll shut the door about quart to five\nI said, she's setting off from platform four\nAnd they've decided\nThat they're gonna let her drive\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell, don't you let her\nNo, don't you know\nShe's sick and tired of\nBeing in the background\nThe passenger\nLet her drive the train, oh\n[Chorus]\nChoo-choo!\nWhy don't you let her drive the train? Oh\nChoo-choo!\nWhy don't you let her drive my train? Yeah, woah\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nChoo-choo!\nChoo-choo!\nChoo-choo!\nChoo-choo!"
