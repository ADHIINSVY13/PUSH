  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen an irresistible force such as you\nMeets an old immovable object like me\nYou can bet just as sure as you live\nSomethin's gotta give, somethin's gotta give, somethin's gotta give\n[Verse 2]\nWhen an irrepressible smile such as yours\nWarms an old implacable heart such as mine\nDon't say no, because I insist\nSomewhere, somehow, someone's gotta be kissed\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store?\nFrom their vast mysterious sky?\nI'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore\nBut how long can anyone try?\n[Chorus]\nFight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might\nChances are some heavenly star-spangled night\nWe'll find out just as sure as we live\nSomethin's gotta give, somethin's gotta give, somethin's gonna give\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nFight, fight, fight it with all of your might\nChances are that some heavenly star-spangled night\nWe'll find out just as sure as we live\nSomethin's gotta give, somethin's gotta give, somethin's gotta give\n[Outro]\nSomethin's gotta give, somethin's gotta give\nAww, let's tear it up"
