  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe's like cold coffee in the morning\nI'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke\nShe'll make me shiver without warning\nAnd make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou can stay with me forever\nOr you could stay with me for now\n[Chorus]\nTell me if I'm wrong\nTell me if I'm right\nTell me if you need a loving hand\nTo help you fall asleep tonight\nTell me if I know\nTell me if I do\nTell me how to fall in love the\nWay you want me to\n[Verse 2]\nI'll wake with coffee in the morning\nBut she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea\nOutside the day is up and calling\nBut I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStay with me forever\nOr you could stay with me for now\n[Chorus]\nTell me if I'm wrong\nTell me if I'm right\nTell me if you need a loving hand\nTo help you fall asleep tonight\nTell me if I know\nTell me if I do\nTell me how to fall in love the\nWay you want me to\n[Bridge]\n'Cause I love the way you wake me up\nAnd for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?\n[Chorus]\nTell me if I'm wrong\nTell me if I'm right\nTell me if you need a loving hand\nTo help you fall asleep tonight\nTell me if I know\nTell me if I do\nTell me how to fall in love the\nWay you want me to\n\n[Outro]\nTell me if I'm wrong\nTell me if I'm right\nTell me if you need a loving hand\nTo help you fall asleep tonight"
