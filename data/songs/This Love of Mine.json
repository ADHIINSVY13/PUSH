  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThis love of mine goes on and on\nThough life is empty since you have gone\nYou're always on my mind, though out of sight\nIt's lonesome through the day, but, oh, the night\n[Verse 2]\nI cry my heart out, it's bound to break\nSince nothing matters, let it break\nI ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine\nWhat's to become of it, this love of mine?\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Outro]\nI ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine\nWhat's to become of it, this love of mine?\nThis love of mine goes on and on"
