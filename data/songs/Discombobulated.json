Wait, I didn't mean to\nPiss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is\nIt goes a little something like this\n[Verse 1]\nSoon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm\nBefore I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?\nUtilizing this tool, I will execute a line\nLike what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized\nMy poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly\nTo the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies\nThen Proof, Denaun\nEye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to 'Drew's and rhyme\nBodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count\nBefore I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound\nNow I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers' noggins how\nDre does every time he goes back to Compton now\n'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds\nAnd Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out\nRoom is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour\nForgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, I'm discombobulated\n\n[Chorus]\nNow up is down, left is right\nDay is night now, in is out, black is white\nSo to-and-fro and side-to-side\nAm I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide\n'Cause back is forth now and stop means go\nNo means yes, but yes don't mean no\nSo, baby, please, take off your clothes\n(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!), yeah\n[Verse 2]\nJust flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit\nBut the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce\nAnd quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar\nThat's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (Haha)\nFuck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw\nAnd a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup\nShout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute\n'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (Posdnuos, yeah)\nWizard of ah's (Oz) and ooh's\nSame Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice\nWho also used to sound like Nas on \"Live at the Barbeque\"\nNow I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you\nLike, au jus, but beef, if like\n\"I was you,\" but, like, ah, fuck you (Man)\nLong as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always\nHave someone to argue with\n, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated, man\n\n[Chorus]\nNow up is down, left is right\nDay is night now, in is out, black is white\nSo to-and-fro and side-to-side\nAm I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide\n'Cause back is forth now and stop means go\nNo means yes, but yes don't mean no\nSo, baby, please, take off your clothes\n(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)\n[Verse 3]\nI'm at my best when I'm at my worst\nAnd for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse\nAnd that's why press, I usually get attacked by first\nThey're at my neck like motherfucking vampires\nSo critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch\nWell, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking a shi-dit\nMid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?\nI'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit\nSo I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara\nNo life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists\nMisdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, \"Why is it\nMy eye itches?\" so they gave me some diet tips\nAnd Viagra with side effects,\n \nI might end up growing spiderwebs\nIn my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath\nI will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits\nI just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?\n\n[Chorus]\nNow up is down, left is right\nDay is night now, in is out, black is white\nSo to-and-fro and side-to-side\nAm I comin' or goin'? Man, I can't decide\n'Cause back is forth now and stop means go\nNo means yes, but yes don't mean no\nSo, baby, please, take off your clothes\n(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)\n[Outro]\nHaha, yeah\nDr. Dre\nBlack Bethoven\nS1\n2050, haha\nWe're out"
