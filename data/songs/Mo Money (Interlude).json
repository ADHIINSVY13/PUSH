  "lyrics": "[Verse]\nMo' money, yeah\nMo' money, blow money, show money\nParty money, side ho money, dope money\nNew clothes money from shit that I wrote money\nSo much money I don't know who stole from me\nHard to keep track I'm used to having no money\nStill broke compared to niggas with old money\nI mean the type of niggas that laugh at Hov money\nBillionaires with petroleum and coal money\nProbably kill they selves if they had Cole money\nTalk shit and I'ma see you like you owe money\nI'm wrapping up the album, fourth quarter I'm so money\nI'm overseas looking for trees to grow money\nPeter Popoff, robbing people for hope money\nProstitutes collecting that \"let me stroke\" money\nPut up a couple dollars for the liquor store money\nUsed to dread the strip club cause I couldn't throw money\nNow the strippers give a nigga the throat for no money\nHow mama gonna teach you how to save your money\nWhen she barely on the boat, got stay afloat money\nBlacks always broke cause we don't know money\nSpend it 'fore we get it and could never hold money\nNo wallets, nah, nigga we'd rather fold money\nMoney control niggas, white man control money\nLaughing like \"yeah yeah my nigga get your money\""
