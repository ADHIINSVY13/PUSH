She never put no work in\nI been slaving away every day, my body is hurting, will it be worth it?\nWhen the curtains open up, pandemonium erupts\nFlorida boys still getting buck, I got two killers ridin' with me\nAK poking out the truck, too many bitches wanna fuck, I give a fuck\nYou wanna smoke to light it up, you wanna drink then pour it up\nThese pills I'm poppin' got me stuck, I'm trapped inside this spiderweb\nThey wanna fill me up with lead, I'm feelin' life like livin'\nDead man walking, walking, dead\nAlways keep them pistols loaded, point it at my fucking head, yuh\nI'm sick of the world, I'm sick of the rumors\nI'm sick of the fame, I'm sick in the head\nI reap what I sow, I'll lend you my bed\nI suffered a lot and I'd rather be dead\n\n[Chorus]\nLemonade don't taste the same when it's been raining outside\nI need something to numb the pain, it's been weighin' on my mind\nPaper chasing keep me racing, Billy, there's no finish line\nBaby Bone, I might be slippin' but I'm still grippin' my .9\nLemonade don't taste the same when it's been raining outside\nI need something to numb the pain, it's been weighin' on my mind\nPaper chasing keep me racing, Billy, there's no finish line\nBaby Bone, I might be slippin' but I'm still grippin' my .9\n[Outro]\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, aye\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh\nALL BUT 6 the gang, aye, ALL BUT 6 the gang, bitch, bitch\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh\nALL BUT 6 the gang, yuh, ALL BUT 6 the gang, aye"
