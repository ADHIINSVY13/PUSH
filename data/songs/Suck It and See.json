  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYour love is like a studded leather headlock\nYour kiss, it could put creases in the rain\nYou're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock\nAnd those other girls are just post-mix lemonade\n[Chorus]\nSuck it and see, you never know\nSit next to me before I go\nJigsaw women with horror movie shoes\nBe cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you\n[Verse 2]\nI poured my aching heart into a pop song\nI couldn't get the hang of poetry\nThat's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun\nAnd I can only hope you've got it aimed at me\n[Chorus]\nSuck it and see, you never know\nSit next to me before I go\nJigsaw women with horror movie shoes\nBe cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for\n[Bridge]\nBlue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La\nHow I often wonder where you are\nYou have got that face that just says\n\"Baby, I was made to break your heart\", oh-oh-oh\n\n[Chorus]\nSuck it and see, you never know\nSit next to me before I go, go, go, go\nJigsaw women with horror movie shoes\nBe cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you"
