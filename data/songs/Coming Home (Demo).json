I got 20 for sure\nStill connect witchu, it's still hid in the drawer\nWith no Js on, I'm still lookin’ to score\nYou see they gave us crack, then started wagin' a war\nUh, all these lies, they steady tellin' me\nBefore Obama, we had Eric B. (Woo)\nOr Tony Lewis out in D.C\nThe '80s kingpins, gotta free them\nAll these faces, they ain't believe in\nIf no child's left, then how can we leave them?\n[Bridge: Pusha T]\nSo just know you're not alone\nMy niggas gone are coming home\nThis is the dope boy song for the dope boys gone\nLet 'em know it’s still snowin’\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nY'all show love for me\nYou ain’t got nothing to prove\nJust know that I still got love for you\nY'all show love for me\nThen I'm gon' tell you the truth\nKnow that I still got love for you\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nUh, I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)\nFor my street-corner survivors (Survivors)\nFor my niggas that miss The Wire (Woo)\nAnd throwback mamis, that won’t retire\nReminiscin' on the days\nWhen the trips was Cancún and the bottles got sprayed\nYou can't relate 'cause you wasn't there\nNah, you wasn't hot, let me make it clear\nY'all was breakin' into cars, we was breakin' bad\nWhen y'all was fightin' dogs, we was racin' Jags\nThis the life for the fast\nAin't no future, ain't no past, we won't worry 'bout the crash, uh\nNow it's jail poses and club pictures\nAirbrush backdrops and jail visits\nThis the dope boy song for the dope boys gone\nLet 'em know it's still snowin'\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nY'all show love for me\nYou ain't got nothing to prove\nJust know that I still got love for you (Oh yeah)\nY'all show love for me\nThen I'm gon' tell you the truth\nKnow that I still got love for you\n\n[Verse 3: Pusha T]\nI'm speakin' to the soul of my black native bros\nWho ain't get to go to school like a J. Cole\nWho ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll\nWho weren't taught the golden rule, but they made do\nFree lunches and apple juices, uh\nFood stamps, ashamed to use 'em\nYou ever lived with the user?\nShared a bed with abusers, that's the worst way to lose 'em\n[Bridge: Pusha T]\nSo just know you're not alone\nMy niggas gone are coming home\nThis is the dope boy song for the dope boys gone\nLet 'em know it's still snowin'\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nY'all show love for me\nYou ain't got nothing to prove\nJust know that I still got love for you\nY'all show love for me\nThen I'm gon' tell you the truth\nKnow that I still got love for you\n[Outro: John Legend]\nOh yeah, know that I still got love for you"
