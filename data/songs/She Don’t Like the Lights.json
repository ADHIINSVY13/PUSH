  "lyrics": "This song is on Justin’s 5th studio album. It’s about his, now ex girlfriend, Selena Gomez and how she didn’t like all of the fame and attention the pair was getting.\n[Verse 1]\nShe don't like the flash\nWanna keep us in the dark\nShe don't like the fame\nHate it when we're miles apart\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd she getting to the point where it's too much for her\nGonna throw us all away cause it's too much for her\nShe can't hide away, cause the world knows who we are\n[Chorus]\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\nShe don't, she don't, she don't\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\nShe don't, she don't, she don't\nDon't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself\nDon't want no love in front of the camera\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\nShe don't, she don't, she don't\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\n[Verse 2]\nNow she's giving ultimatums\nShe don't like this life\nShe said if I loved her\nI'd give it up, won't think twice\nI can't do that\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd it's getting to the point where it's too much for her\nWanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for\nShe don't wanna live this life\nDamn, that's why I love her\n[Chorus]\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\nShe don't, she don't, she don't\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\nShe don't, she don't, she don't\nDon't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself\nDon't want no love in front of the camera\nShe don't like the lights, whoah\nShe don't, she don't, she don't\nShe don't like the lights\n[Bridge]\nHow can I choose between the two, when all the lights are all I know?\nI wish she could see how good this can be\nI hope that she waits a little bit longer\nCause I don't wanna live life without her by my side\nCause she gives the light that's in me\nBut she don't know whoah, she don't know whoah\n[Outro]\nShe don't like the lights\nThe lights\nThe lights, the lights whoah\nShe don't like the lights whoah\nShe don't like the lights, no\nShe don't like the lights"
