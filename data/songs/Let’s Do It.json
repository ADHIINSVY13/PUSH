  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhen the little blue bird who has never said a word starts to sing, \"Spring, spring\"\nWhen the little bluebell in the bottom of the dell starts to ring, \"Ding-ding\"\nWhen the little blue clerk in the middle of his work starts a tune to the moon up above\nIt is nature, that's all, simply telling us to fall in love\n[Verse 1]\nAnd that's why birds do it, bees do it\nEven educated fleas do it\n[Refrain]\nLet's do it, let's fall in love\n[Verse 2]\nIn Spain, the best upper sets do it\nLithuanians and Letts do it\n[Refrain]\nLet's do it, let's fall in love\n[Verse 3]\nThe Dutch in old Amsterdam do it\nNot to mention the Finns\nFolks in Siam do it\nThink of Siamese twins\nSome Argentines without means do it\nPeople say in Boston even beans do it\n\n[Refrain]\nLet's do it, let's fall in love\n[Interlude]\nTake it, Brian\nMm, mm, yeah\n[Verse 4]\nElectric eels, I might add, do it\nThough it shocks 'em, I know\nWhy ask if shad do it?\nWaiter, bring me shad roe\nIn shallow shoals, English soles do it\nGoldfish in the privacy of bowls do it\n[Refrain]\nLet's do it, let's fall in love\nLet's do it, let's fall in love"
