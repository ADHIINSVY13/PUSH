  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPeople it's time now, something's gotta change\nPeople, we no longer can live in pain\nWe've got to find the truth\nWe've got to know where it is\n'Cause we stand here together, fighting year after year\nWe're lost in our search\nWe've been longing to find\nWe can't hold back no longer\n'Cause we're running out of time\n[Chorus]\nDance for the world\nDance for the world\nGotta dance for the world\nDance for the world\n[Verse 2]\nPeople, my people\nWe've gone too far, it's time now\nTo find out just who we really are\nLook no further to find who it is\nThe truth is inside you, it shines from within\nI know you're weary, your hearts full of fear\nI see the hope inside you, behind all the tears\n\n[Chorus]\nDance for the world\nDance for the world\nDance for the world\nGot to dance for the world\n[Bridge]\nIf we could all just love one another\nWe would see there is nothing more important\nOr greater than love for the people\n[Outro]\nI would dance for the world\nI would sing for the world\nI would pray for the world\nPeople dance for the world"
