  "lyrics": "Dave Grohlâ€™s voice has a very melancholy sound on this track. This, along with the repetitive, buzzing chord progression gives the listener the feeling of being exhausted.\n[Verse 1]\nI'm not around that much, runnin'\nExhausted, and lost\nIf it could be undone, will it\nHave costed? It's taught\nAnd lost\n[Verse 2]\nBlowing away, we stray wilted\nExalted, at fault\nWhat if the day had stayed in bed?\nThese baubles we've brought\nAt fault\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Verse 3]\nAfter the bliss has long ended\nThis caution, this fault\nGive me a breeze that's long-winded\nAccosted\n, adult\nArrested\n[Instrumental Outro]"
