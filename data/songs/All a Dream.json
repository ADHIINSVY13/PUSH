  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAnd we finally awake\nAnd walk into the sunny day\nI can see it in your face\nThat everything will be okay\n'Cause you never hurt\nSomeone who wants to learn\nTo be your slave\n[Verse 1]\nAnd the night is oh so clear\nThe clouds will never reappear\nBut the moon is out of place\nAnd all the trees are looking strange\n[Chorus]\nAnd feeling the warmth of your breath\nAgainst my skin\nNow I hope this isn't only just a dream\n[Verse 2]\nSo we run into a church\nThe people all look the same\nAnd the sun is in my eyes\nI'm trying hard to scream your name\n\n[Chorus 2]\nMy stomach starts to churn\nAnd the curtains in the wind begin to burn\nAnd now I know it's all a dream\n[Verse 3]\nEnemy sleeps with me night or day\nEnemy teases every minute in my mind\nHe's in my mind\nEnemy throws all my money away\nEnemy knows how to make me always pay\nI always pay\nEnemy lies don't cross my mind\nEnemy talks, talking so nice and kind\nSo nice and kind\n[Verse 4]\nAnd how long does it take\nTo fight off this weakness?\nAnd tell him\nTo guard me\n'Cause God knows I'm sorry\n[Outro]\nMmm\nOoo"
