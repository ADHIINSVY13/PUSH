  "lyrics": "Well, I stumbled in the darkness\nI'm lost and alone\nThough I said I'd go before us\nAnd show the way back home\nIs there a light up ahead?\nI can't hold on very long\nForgive me, pretty baby\nBut I always take the long way home\nMoney's just something you throw\nOff the back of a train\nI got a head full of lightning\nAnd a hat full of rain\nAnd I know that I said\nI'd never do it again\nOh and I love you, sweet baby\nBut I always take the long way home\nI put food on the table\nAnd a roof overhead\nBut I'd trade it all tomorrow\nFor the highway instead\nWatch your back, if I should tell you\nLove's the only thing I've ever known\nOne thing for sure, sweet baby\nI always take the long way home\n\nYou know I love you, baby\nMore than the whole wide world\nI'm your woman\nYou know you are my pearl\nSo let's go out past the party lights\nWhere we can finally be alone\nCome with me\nAnd we can take the long way home\nCome with me\nTogether we can take the long way home\nCome with me\nTogether we can take the long way home"
