  "lyrics": "Wikipedia says this album is songs that Bowie thought that Americans should know.  Apparently George Harrison also thought everyone knew this song, since he referenced it heavily in “It’s all too much.”\n[Chorus]\nWith your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue\nThe only thing I ever got from you\nWas sorrow\nSorrow\n[Verse 1]\nYou acted funny trying to spend my money\nYou're out there playing your high class games\nOf sorrow\nSorrow\nYou never do what you know you oughta\nSomething tells me you're a Devil's daughter\nSorrow\nSorrow\nAhh, ooh, ooh\n[Verse 2]\nI tried to find her 'cause I can't resist her\nI never knew just how much I missed her\nSorrow\nSorrow\n[Chorus]\nWith your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue\nThe only thing I ever got from you\nWas sorrow\nSorrow\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\n[Bridge]\nWith your long blonde hair\nI couldn't sleep last night\nWith your long blonde hair"
