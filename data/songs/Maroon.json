  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen the morning came\nWe were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf\n'Cause we lost track of time again\nLaughing with my feet in your lap\nLike you were my closest friend\n\"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?\" you say\n\"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how\"\nI see you every day now\n[Chorus]\nAnd I chose you\nThe one I was dancing with\nIn New York, no shoes\nLooked up at the sky and it was\nThe burgundy on my t-shirt\nWhen you splashed your wine into me\nAnd how the blood rushed into my cheeks\nSo scarlet, it was\nThe mark thеy saw on my collarbone\nThe rust that grew bеtween telephones\nThe lips I used to call home\nSo scarlet, it was maroon\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the silence came\nWe were shaking, blind and hazy\nHow the hell did we lose sight of us again?\nSobbing with your head in your hands\nAin't that the way shit always ends?\nYou were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway\nCarnations you had thought were roses, that's us\nI feel you, no matter what\nThe rubies that I gave up\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I lost you\nThe one I was dancing with\nIn New York, no shoes\nLooked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)\nThe burgundy on my t-shirt\nWhen you splashed your wine into me\nAnd how the blood rushed into my cheeks\nSo scarlet, it was (Maroon)\nThe mark they saw on my collarbone\nThe rust that grew between telephones\nThe lips I used to call home\nSo scarlet, it was maroon\n[Bridge]\nAnd I wake with your memory over me\nThat's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)\nAnd I wake with your memory over me\nThat's a real fucking legacy to leave\n[Chorus]\nThe burgundy on my t-shirt\nWhen you splashed your wine into me\nAnd how the blood rushed into my cheeks\nSo scarlet, it was maroon\nThe mark they saw on my collarbone\nThe rust that grew between telephones\nThe lips I used to call home\nSo scarlet, it was maroon\n\n[Outro]\nIt was maroon\nIt was maroon"
