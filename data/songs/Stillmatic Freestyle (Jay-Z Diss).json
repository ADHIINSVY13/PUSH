City, grab a hold and ride with me\nRip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with Money Bags\nStop in Philly, order cheesesteaks and eat Beans fast\nAnd bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York\nYou show off,\n \nI count dough off when you sample my voice\nI rule you—before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens\nNas designed your blueprint, who you kidding?\nIs he H to the izz-O, M to the izz-O?\nFor shizzle, you phony,\n \nthe rapping version of Sisqó\nAnd that's for certain, \nyou clone me, your wack clothes line\nI'd rather Sean John,\n \nbore me with your fake coke rhymes\nAnd those times, they never took place, you liar\nUn was your first court case, you had no priors\nYou master-fabricated stories of streets and sound slick\nHave you surrounded, you and the faggots you down with\nWhile they riding Nas, tryna boost they career\nCorny as Cormega, all you hip-hop queers\nSince \nIllmatic\n, \nIt Was Written\n, \nI Am Nastradamus\nThat's the answers to the puzzle I gave you; now, here's a promise\nMy next few albums—instead of projects\nThey'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics\nCome in my hood, but bring the guns with you,\n \nit's dark\nHeaded through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx\nHeaded through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts\nNew Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town\n, every block\nI'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page\nDid crimes and headline on stage\nI signed a contract, so here it is, you have it\nStreet's Disciple\n, I'm \nStillmatic\n\n[Outro: \nWoman's voice\n]\nYou make me feel so good"
