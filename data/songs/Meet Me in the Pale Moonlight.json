Is he mine?\"\nNot quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him\nNot quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him\n[Chorus]\nI can be your one time baby\nI can be your little dairy queen\nI don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight\nYou don't have to give me anything\nJust put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby"
