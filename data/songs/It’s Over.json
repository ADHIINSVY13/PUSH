Is it really not? Yuh\nDo you still get those stomach knots and those butterflies\nWhen you look at me with those brown eyes?\nBaby, don't lie, I can take the pain\nI just really wanna know what you've been up to\nMaybe waitin' for another man to fuck you\nGot me wishin' that I never fell in love with you\n[Pre-Chorus: Rocci]\nI keep thinking that it's over now\n(I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide, no)\nI'm just hopin' that she'll come around\nAnd everything that she's done to me\nI guess it really wasn't meant to be\n[Chorus: Rocci]\nI can't hide it, even though I've tried it\nI can keep on smilin' but she terrifies me\nI can't hide it, even though I've tried it\nI can keep on smilin' but it's over now\n[Outro: Rocci]\n(But it's over now)"
