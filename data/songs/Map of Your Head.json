  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm sick of feeding my soul\nTo people who'll never know\nJust how purposeless and empty they've grown\nBecause their language confuses like\nComputers refuse to understand how I'm feeling today\n[Chorus]\nI'm freezing, and losing my way\nI don't need another map of your head\nI am freezing, and losing my way\nI don't need another map of your head\n[Verse 2]\nI saw a liquid control\nThat gives life to our soul\nI hit my head on it and woke up to know\nThat I was all alone\nWearing just socks and a phone\nSomeone screaming like their world might explode\n[Chorus]\nI'm freezing, and losing my way\nI don't need another map of your head\nI am freezing, and losing my way\nI don't want another map of your head\n\nOooh... (What?)\n[Chorus]\nFreezing, and losing my way\nI don't want another map of your head\nI am freezing, and losing my way\nI don't need another map of your head, yeah"
