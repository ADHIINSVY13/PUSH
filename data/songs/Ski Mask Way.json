Go 'head; the last nigga that tried\nGot hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died\nYour little sister calling you stupid, reason why?\nHer and your mama in the living room now hog-tied\nI came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait\nGot a brand-new SIG and that old .38\nI be scheming to put a little bread on my plate\nWatching dreads serve skunk through a hole in the gate\nI stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day\nYou thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch, please\nThis the stash house, jackpot, there go them keys\nMy black G-Unit hoodie just reek of marijuana\nCocaine coming out my pores in the sauna\nI'm serious, man, I'm so sincere\nThis the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career\nMake money, take money, yeah, nigga, YEAH!\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThat chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThem earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nTake that shit off, \nmove, I'll break you off properly\nI get mine the fast way, ski mask way\nMake money, make money-money-money\nNigga, if you ask me, this the only way\nTake money, take money-money-money\n[Verse 2]\nWho's that peeping in my window?\nWow—the Feds on me now\nThey know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake\nI know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming, \"Fuck Jake!\"\nI'm tryna stay out them pens, so I switched states\nBad news,\n VA, now, that sounds great\nI see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up\nThis town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked\nI holla at A.I. peoples to get gats\nThey charge me 500 apiece for two MACs\nThen I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree\nCatch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D\nGet me a little crew, I'll have 'em pumping for me\nThe more product I take, the more paper we see\nChange my name in NY, they don't know where I be\nYeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low-key\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThat chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nThem earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?\nTake that shit off, \nmove, I'll break you off properly\nI get mine the fast way, ski mask way\nMake money, make money-money-money\nNigga, if you ask me, this the only way\nTake money, take money-money-money"
