  "lyrics": "Must you dance every dance\nWith the same fortunate man?\nYou have danced with him since the music began\nWon't you change partners and dance with me?\nMust you dance quite so close\nWith your lips touching his face?\nCan't you see I'm longing to be in his place?\nWon't you change partners and dance with me?\nAsk him to sit this one out and while you're alone\nI'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone\nYou've been locked in his arms\nEver since heaven-knows-when\nWon't you change partners and then\nYou may never want to change partners again\nWon't you change partners and then\nYou may never want to change partners again"
