  "lyrics": "The closing track and a fairly simple song about love.\n[Verse 1]\nA pussyfooting setting sun\nMake a wish that weighs a tonne\nThere are no handles for you to hold\nAnd no understanding where it goes\n[Verse 2]\nJealousy in technicolor\nFear by name, love by numbers\nStreet lamp amber, wanderlust\nPowder in a blunderbuss\n[Chorus]\nShe looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me\nAnd suddenly the sky is a scissor\nSitting on the floor with a tambourine\nCrushing up a bundle of love\nDon't take it so personally\nYou're not the only one\nThat time has got it in for, honey\nThat's where you're wrong\n[Verse 3]\nAll the old flames fastened on\nMake a wish that weighs a tonne\nThere are no handles you can hold\nAnd no understanding where it goes\n\n[Chorus]\nShe looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me\nAnd suddenly the sky is a scissor\nSitting on the floor with a tambourine\nCrushing up a bundle of love\nDon't take it so personally\nYou're not the only one\nThat time has got it in for, honey\nThat's where you're wrong\n[Outro]\nThat's where you're wrong\nThat's where you're wrong\nOh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh\nOh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
