  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLego Napoleon movie\nWritten in noble gas-filled glass tubes\nUnderlined in sparks\nI'll admit it's elaborate for a wakin' thought\nVortex to vortex\nThe Business they call Show\nHasn't ever been this pumped up before\nHello, gruesome\nThere's just enough time left to swing by\nAnd re-address the start\nIf you call and have them pull around the car\nAnd stop specialising in stories from the road\n[Chorus]\nHello you, still draggin' out a long goodbye?\nI ought to apologise for one of the last times\n[Verse 2]\n\"As that meandering chapter reaches its end\nAnd leaves us in a thoughtful little daze\nThis \nelectric warrior's\n motorcade\nShall burn no more rubber down that boulevard\"\nRead the message I left on the thank you card\nOvertaking the tractor\nWaitin' for sets of winds and bends to level out again\nPickin' your moment along a country lane\nThe kind where the harmonies feel right at home\n\n[Chorus]\nHello you, still draggin' out a long goodbye?\nI ought to apologise for one of the last times\n[Verse 3]\nTakin' a dive into your crystal ball\nI've snorkelled on the beaches fruitlessly\nWhy not rewind to \nRawborough Snooker Club\n?\nI could pass for seventeen if I just get a shave and catch some Z's\n[Outro]\nHello you\nHello you"
