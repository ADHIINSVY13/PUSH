Who are you to judge?\nHey, hide your lies, hide your lies\nOnly you to trust, only you\n[Chorus]\nI only call you when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\n'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me\n'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe\nI only love it when it's half past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\n'Cause I'm messed up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm messed up, that's the real me, babe\nThat's the real me, babe"
