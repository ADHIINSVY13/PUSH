  "lyrics": "pages 10 & 11\nLife through my bloodshot eyes\nwould scare a square 2 death\npoverty, murder, violence\nand never a moment 2 rest\nFun and games R few\nbut treasured like gold 2 me\ncuz I realize that I must return\n2 my spot in poverty\nBut mock my words when I say\nmy heart will not exist\nunless my destiny comes through\nand puts an end 2 all of this"
