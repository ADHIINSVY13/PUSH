  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nPlease picture me in the trees\nI hit my peak at seven\nFeet in the swing over the creek\nI was too scared to jump in\nBut I, I was high in the sky\nWith Pennsylvania under me\nAre there still beautiful things?\n[Chorus]\nSweet tea in the summer\nCross your heart, won't tell no other\nAnd though I can’t recall your face\nI still got love for you\nYour braids like a pattern\nLove you to the Moon and to Saturn\nPassed down like folk songs\nThe love lasts so long\n[Bridge]\nAnd I've been meaning to tell you\nI think your house is haunted\nYour dad is always mad and that must be why\nAnd I think you should come live with me\nAnd we can be pirates\nThen you won't have to cry\nOr hide in the closet\nAnd just like a folk song\nOur love will be passed on\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlease picture me in the weeds\nBefore I learned civility\nI used to scream ferociously\nAny time I wanted\nI, I\n[Chorus]\nSweet tea in the summer\nCross my heart, won’t tell no other\nAnd though I can't recall your face\nI still got love for you\nPack your dolls and a sweater\nWe'll move to India forever\nPassed down like folk songs\nOur love lasts so long"
