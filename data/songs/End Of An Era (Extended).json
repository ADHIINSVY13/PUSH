Baby, this could be forever, forever\n[Post-Chorus]\nIn the clouds, there she goes\nButterflies, let them flow\n'Nother girl falls in love\nAnother girl leaves the club\nSend a big kiss goodbye\nTo all of the pretty eyes (End of an era)\nAnother girl falls in love\nAnother girl leaves the club\n[Break]\n(Forever)\n(Forever)\n[Verse 2]\nNo more \"you're not my type\", no more \"at least I tried\"\nDone with the lonely nights, I guess\nOne chapter might be done, God knows I had some fun\nNew one has just begun\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou said, \"Hey\"\nAnd I said, \"Hey\nWhat's your name?\"\nCome with me\n'Cause when I see your face (Ah)\n[Chorus]\nThe sweetest pleasure\nI feel like we're gonna be together\nThis could be the end of an era\nWho knows? Baby, this could be forever, forever\n[Post-Chorus]\nIn the clouds, there she goes\nButterflies, let them flow\n'Nother girl falls in love\nAnother girl leaves the club\nSend a big kiss goodbye\nTo all of the pretty eyes (End of an era)\nAnother girl falls in love\nAnother girl leaves the club\n[Bridge]\nI've lost all my senses\nLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\nIs this my happy ending?\nLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\n(Here she goes again)\n\n[Chorus]\nThe sweetest pleasure\nI feel like we're gonna be together\nThis could be the end of an era\nWho knows? Baby, this could be forever, forever\n[Post-Chorus]\nIn the clouds, there she goes\nButterflies, let them flow (End of an era)\n'Nother girl falls in love\nAnother girl leaves the club\nSend a big kiss goodbye\nTo all of the pretty eyes (End of an era)\nAnother girl falls in love\nAnother girl leaves the club"
