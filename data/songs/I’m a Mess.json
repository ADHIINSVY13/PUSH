  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOh, I'm a mess right now, inside out\nSearching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end\nI can't work it out, how?\nGoing through the motions, going through us\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd, oh, I've known it for the longest time\nAnd all of my hopes, all of my words\nAre all over written on the signs\nWhen you're on my road walkin' me home\nHome, home, home, home\n[Chorus]\nSee the flames inside my eyes\nIt burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no\nEasy, baby, maybe I'm a liar\nBut for tonight, I wanna fall in love\nAnd put your faith in my stomach\n[Verse 2]\nI messed up this time, late last night\nDrinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined\nI can't shake this feeling now\nWe're going through the motions, hopin' you'd stop\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know\nBut all of my words will always be low\nOf all, all the love we spoke\nWhen you're on my road walkin' me home\nHome, home, home, home\n[Chorus]\nSee the flames inside my eyes\nIt burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no\nEasy, baby, maybe I'm a liar\nBut for tonight, I wanna fall in love\nAnd put your faith in my stomach\n[Bridge]\nAnd for how long I love my lover?\nFor how long I love my lover now, now?\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now? (And I feel love)\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\n(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\n(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\n(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\n(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)\nFor how long, long I love my lover now, now?\n(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)\n[Outro]\nFor how long I love my lover now, now?\nFor how long, long I love my lover?"
