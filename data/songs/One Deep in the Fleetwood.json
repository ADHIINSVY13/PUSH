  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLife goes on as time passes me by\nI always been solid, why you askin' me now?\nI'm a rock Glock tucked in the pocket of the tux\nIt's always about a buck, see me waddle like a duck\nWhen I get fucked up, kick my feet up like Chuck\nBitch, I'm a millionaire, you think I give a fuck?\nGot my mama sitting pretty in that Bentley truck\nSay what you want about me\nFuck boy never made it out the minor league\nI bleed for my brothers, I plead for the kids who can't breathe\nFTP on my sleeve, I sleep with a pistol on me\nPlease protect me from my enemies\nWhite chalk, blue lines, red lights\nDeath threats, I fight for my life\nAnd I strive and I ride, put my city on my back\nTook a lot of strugglin' and pain to get to where I'm at, yuh\n[Verse 2]\nSavor your breath, one day closer to death, I speak from the soul\nThe burn in the chest, from head to my feet\nThe music complete me when I feel defeated\nI'm one deep in the Fleetwood with the top down, wind blowin' in my bald spot\nMiddle finger out the window, still\nThrowin' out blue hundred dollar bills\nTryna fill the void, silence all the noise\nPlace a bet on the table I can't afford, yuh\n\n[Chorus]\nI see why they think I sold my soul\nReally don't know how deep this goes\nOn my own since sixteen years old\nI had to cut ties to roll the bankroll\nI see why they think I sold my soul\nReally don't know how deep this goes\nOn my own since sixteen years old\nI had to cut ties to roll the bankroll"
