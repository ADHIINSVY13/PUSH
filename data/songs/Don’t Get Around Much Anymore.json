  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMissed the Saturday dance\nHeard they crowded the floor\nCouldn't bear it without you\nDon't get around much anymore\nThought I'd visit the club\nGot as far as the door\nThey'd have asked me about you, daddy\nDon't get around much anymore\n[Bridge]\nDarling, I guess my mind is more at ease\nBut never, never, nevertheless, why stir up memories?\n[Verse 2]\nBeen invited on dates\nI might have gone but what for?\nIt's awfully different without you\nDon't get around much anymore\n[Bridge]\nAnd oh, oh, darling, darling, darling, I guess\nMy mind is more at ease\nBut never, never, nevertheless, why stir up memories?\n[Outro]\nBeen invited on dates\nMight have gone but what for?\nOh, it's awfully different without you, daddy\nDon't get around much anymore\nDon't get around much anymore\nDon't get around much anymore"
