  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWe can get along, but I'll still keep the piece to keep the beast away from me\nI know he's waiting patiently for me to arrive\nI survived so many nights and my torturous ways\nSo really, it's myself the one that should be afraid\nI walk a tight rope between God and the reaper and I'm ready\nFor either, but they leave it up to me to choose my path\nI got this wrath inside my chest and it's burning, don't get rest\nSometime I feel like it's a test, but rest assured, I know therе's more\nTo life than this, you blink, you miss, next thing you know you'rе deep in shit\nThinking about the things you could've done different, I know we wish\nUpon the stars but know they way too far, when do we give up?\nWhen that liquor don't give you hiccups and those pills don't get your dick hard\n[Chorus]\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\n[Verse 2]\nGet your diploma, go to college, you might be somebody\nYou hang with bums, you might become one, boy, just think about it\nCan't go too far with shackles on your feet, connected to the weakest link\nIn your crew (Don't hold me back, don't hold me down)\nDon't hold me back, don't hold me down, just let me swim or make me drown\nYou surround yourself with clowns, well, what that make you?\nGot a lot to go around but when that bank account drown\nNo one is to be found so what's that tell you?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\n[Verse 3]\nI lock myself in my room every night with my pistol gripped tight\nFightin' demons left and right, with all my might\nI might convince myself that I'm the chosen one for everyone to leech off\nBut fuck that, I can't be the one to feed all\nNo, you won't be takin' advantage, need a Xanax for the damage\nTo the canvas of my life, I gotta manage\nStep to the side if you ain't ridin' with me, bitch, I need someone\nI could confide in with no judgment or passive-aggressiveness\n[Chorus]\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode?\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Chorus]\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode? (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old (Yeah, yeah)\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told (Ayy, ayy, yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode? (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old (Yeah, yeah)\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told (Ayy, ayy, yeah-yeah)\n[Verse 4]\nLiberate your mind and soon the soul will follow\nGotta keep my tips hollow and my dick swallowed\nDrowning in my sorrows, praying for tomorrow\nFlying down the I9 like OJ in the Bronco\nFor the love of money, yeah, I need it pronto\nThe fame is overrated and, quite frankly, hard to handle\nWay too many situations tend to turn to scandals\nYou can't bury me with lies, bitch, so put away them candles, yeah\n[Chorus]\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode? (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old (Yeah, yeah)\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told (Ayy, ayy, yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode? (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old (Yeah, yeah)\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told (Ayy, ayy, yeah-yeah)\n\n[Verse 5]\nRace against the clock, we die for drop tops\nLong walks in flip flops, out the dark, into the light\nIn spite of everything I did wrong, I hope they singing my song when I'm long gone\nI hope I make it through the long haul that we call life\nWhen it come to this rap shit, I got the Midas Touch\nI'm like Kobe clutch with the .40 tucked\n'Cause I can never trust nobody, even second-guess myself\nKeep my eyes wide open, yeah, I keep my eyes wide open\n[Chorus]\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode? (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old (Yeah, yeah)\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told (Ayy, ayy, yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we get high? To balance out the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nWhy do we sit by and watch the world implode? (Yeah-yeah, yeah)\nNot getting younger and that's getting really old (Yeah, yeah)\nSit down, watch it unfold, 'cause that's what I was told (Ayy, ayy, yeah-yeah)\n[Outro]\nWhy do we get high? Get— Get high, get—\nWhy do we get high? Get— Get high, get—\nWhy do we—\nWhy do we get high?"
