And\nBut I know that it's worth it to\nSpend forever with you\n[Chorus]\nAnd so I count to three and get on one knee\nAnd I ask you\nDarlin', honestly\nI've waited all this time just to make it right\nSo I'll ask you (Tonight)\nWill you marry me? Just say yes\nOne word, one love, one life\n[Verse 2]\nA gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair\nLips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware\nArms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes\nWhat a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives\nSun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red\nMy chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed\nLast night was the night, one last moment of truth\nAnd what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy was I feelin' nervous when\nThings were goin' so perfect? And\nWell, now I know that it's worth it to\nSpend forever with you\n[Chorus]\nAnd so I count to three and get on one knee\nAnd I ask you\nDarlin', honestly\nI've waited all this time just to make it right\nSo I'll ask you (Tonight)\nWill you marry me? Just say yes\nOne word, one love, one life\n[Outro]\n(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be\n(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be\n(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be\n(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be\n(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be\n(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be\n(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be\n(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be"
