Where did you go?\n[Bridge]\nYou're falling about\nYou took a left off Last Laugh Lane\nJust sounding it out\nBut you're not coming back again\nYou're falling about\nYou took a left off Last Laugh Lane\nYou were just sounding it out\nBut you're not coming back again\n[Outro]\nYou used to get it in your fishnets\n(\nFalling about\n)\nNow you only get it in your night dress\nDiscarded all the naughty nights for niceness\n(\nYou took a left off Last Laugh Lane\n)\nLanded in a very common crisis\nEverything's in order in a black hole\n(\nYou were just sounding it out\n)\nIs anything as pretty in the past though?\nThat Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco\n(\nYou're not coming back again\n)\nRemember when you used to be a rascal, oh?"
