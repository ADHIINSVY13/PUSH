Just to attain some mo'\nProps from strangers that don't got a clue what I been aimin' for?\nSince the age of fourteen, Jermaine is no king\nIf that means I gotta dig up dirt and pay the whole team\nOf algorithm-bot niggas just to sway the whole thing\nOn social media, competin' for your favorable memes\nTo be considered best or live and rest? The weight of both things\nI understand the thirst of being first that made 'em both swing\nProtecting legacies, so lines got crossed, perhaps regrettably\nMy friends went to war, I walked away with all they blood on me\nNow some will discredit me, try wipe away my pedigree\nBut please, find a nigga out that's rappin' this incredibly, uh\nMy dawg texted me, I'll share the words he said to me\n\"If you refuse to shoot the gun, don't mean the gun ain't deadly,\" uh\nI guess in that metaphor, hypothetically, the gun is me\nI text him back like, \"Guess a gun ain't what I'm tryna be, my nigga\"\nThey strip me of my spot, and now I'm finally free, my nigga\nThey say I'm pickin' sides, ayy, don't you lie on me, my nigga\nThen start another war, ayy, Drake, you'll always be my nigga\nI ain't ashamed to say you did a lot for me, my nigga\nFuck all the narratives\nTappin' back into your magic pen is what's imperative\nRemindin' these folks why we do it, it's not for beefin'\nIt's for speakin' our thoughts, pushin' ourselves, reachin' the charts\nReaching your minds, keepin' your hearts, creepin' to find\nEmotions to touch, somethin' inside to open you up\nHelp you cope with the rough times and shit\nI'm sendin' love 'cause we ain't promised shit\nMy nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nY'all niggas ain't stoppin' me (Yeah, \nknow that you are loved\n)\nY'all niggas ain't stoppin' me (Y'all niggas, \nooh\n)\nY'all niggas ain't stoppin' me\nY'all niggas ain't stoppin' me (\nEven if you don't love yourself\n)\nY'all niggas ain't stoppin' me\nY'all niggas ain't stoppin' me\nY'all niggas ain't"
