  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTook a trip to San Francisco\nAll  our friends said we would jive\nDidn't  work, so I left for Fresno\nIt was quite a scenic drive\nPulled over to watch the children in the park\nWe  used to only worry for them after dark\n[Chorus]\nI’m  still looking for my own version of America\nOne without the gun, where the flag can freely fly\nNo  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide\nIt's just a dream I had in mind\nIt's just a dream I had in mind\nIt’s just a dream I had in mind\n[Verse 2]\nI  flew back to New York City\nMissed that Hudson River line\nTook a train up to Lake Placid\nThat's another place and time, where\nI used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues\nSo many things that I think twice about before I do now\n[Chorus]\nI'm still looking for my own version of America\nOne without the gun, where the flag can freely fly\nNo bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide\nIt's just a dream I had in mind\nIt's just a dream I had in mind\nIt's just a dream I had in mind\nIt's just a dream I had in mind"
