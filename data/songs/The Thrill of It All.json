  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI regret that I told the world\nThat you were with me\nAnd I regret how I showed the world\nThat you were pretty\nI never thought I'd learn so much\nSo much from bein' lonely\nBut I guess I didn't learn enough\n'Cause now you won't hold me\n[Chorus]\nI guess I got lost in the moment\nI guess I got lost in the fall\nI guess I got lost in your heartbeat\nIn the thrill of it all\nAnd I guess you were goddamn perfect\n'Cause every single time you call\nI remind myself of what I lost that night, my love\nIn the thrill of it all\nIn the thrill of it all\n[Verse 2]\nEven though we weren't in love\nIt was far from lust\nMmm, yeah, you were beautiful\nBut in you, I could trust\nOthers, they warned my heart\nThey said I would lose fast\nThey said that you were stoppin' ground\nAnd soon to be my past\n\n[Chorus]\nI guess I got lost in the moment\nI guess I got lost in the fall\nI guess I got lost in your heartbeat\nIn the thrill of it all\nAnd I guess you were goddamn perfect\n'Cause every single time you call\nI remind myself of what I lost that night, my love\nIn the thrill of it all, oh\nIn the thrill of it all\n[Outro]\nAnd I guess you were goddamn perfect\n'Cause every single time you call\nI remind myself of what I lost that night, my love\nI remind myself of what I lost that night, my love\nI remind myself of what I lost that night, my love\nIn the thrill of it all"
