And I think that that's the funny thing, is the internet... you know, you feel so powerful and... somehow invisible at the same time? But... everybody sees it. You say crazy stuff on the internet thinking \"ah... nobody will see it\". It's really just about the... insanity of... paparazzi, and articles, and comment sections, and Twitter!"
