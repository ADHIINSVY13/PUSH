[scream]\nFinneas:\n \nLet's do that little second\nBillie: [Vocalizing] \nBut play loud when it gets to hype up.\n [vocalizing]\nBillie:\n You call me again, drunk in your Benz\nDrivin’ home under the influence\nYou scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath\n’Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends\nFinneas:\n I don't relate to you\nBillie:\n I don't relate to you, no\n'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty\nYou made me hate this city"
