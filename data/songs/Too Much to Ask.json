  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe smiles as she walked in the room\nHave all turned into frowns, am I too quick to assume\nThat the love is no longer in bloom?\nThe tantrums and the tears play a very different tune\nTo what they did before, \nher head's red raw\nAnd the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around\nWhen you sobbed before, it felt much more like\nThe product of a squabble, now there's reason for it to be something more\n[Chorus]\nAnd there would be\nOh, it's uncertain whether the curtain has\nShut for good, \nshe said\n\"See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it\"\nAnd, \"If you loved meâ€”\"\nAnd I interrupted, received a scowl and stare\nBut still decided to stop her there\n[Verse 2]\nWould it be outrageous to say\nWe're either shouting or we're shagging\nDocked in tempestuous bays?\nOr at least that's how it felt yesterday\nThe eyes are getting heavier\nAnd whether you're asleep or awake\n\n[Chorus]\nIs a mystery\nWould a kiss be too much to ask?\nWhen you fit me\nAs Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask\nIt's a pity\nIt just hit me, we can't go back\nTo the chest touching on the back"
