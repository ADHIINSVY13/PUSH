  "lyrics": "You say you don't need me\nI know where your love goes\nYou go missing after midnight\nI should know better and the bed is cold\nAnd if you think I'm not the real thing\nI don't wanna die of hunger\nI got my world created for you\nBut you don't stay\nNot my imagination no more\nI can't be dealing with the bad girl\nLives in your head\nYou got your someone I , don't cry\nYou go and take a strangers love instead\nOver you is where I should be\nI could be loving you too much\nUnder me is where you should be\nI could be loving you too much\nYou know I love the way you do it\nWhen you do it right\nYou ain't no one man woman\nWere you ever\nIf you don't come back running\nWhen you've had enough\nAnd baby , you got it , I want it\nShow me what's left of your love\n\nOver you is where I should be\nI could be loving you too much\nUnder me is where you should be\nI could be loving you too much\nI won't be no dirty weekend\nI stay with you for good\nHe can be your outside lover\nI've got eyes\nI know he's in your blood\nJust let me hold you for the hour\nI go where you lead me\nI need some inspiration from you\nI'm ready for the mystery , take me\nDon't let me fall\nDon't let me drown down here in the rain\nThere is no alibi , don't lie\nYou love a stranger and the world is pain\nOver you is where I should be\nI could be loving you too much\nUnder me is where you should be\nI could be loving you too much\nToo much , too much\nToo much , too much\nToo much , too much\nToo much , too much ( come a little bit closer)\nToo much , too much ( come a little bit closer)\nToo much , too much ( come a little bit closer)\nToo much , too much ( come a little bit closer)\nToo much , too much ( come a little bit closer)"
