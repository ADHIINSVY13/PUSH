  "lyrics": "In the name of love and life\nTurn your face to the lonely night\nBut you're not alone when she calls you home\nAnd this your world is on the edge\nAs good as lost but you know the way\nThrough this faceless town\nAnd she pulls me down\nI know the place and the time (of our lives)\nSo long ago\nAnd all through the years (never dies)\nAll things must pass\nIrresistible force meets an immovable object\nAnd human animal madness and blood starts to flow\nInvisible fingers and indescribable pleasure\nI got to find my personal god\nI got to find my personal god\nGod of love, god of gold\nRing of fire in the days of old\nIt's what I'm living for\nAnd love's the only law\nSo answer Mayday, S.O.S\nSearch me North, East, South and West\nIt's all I miss, just the one last kiss\n\nThis is goodbye to the days (of our lives)\nMy fair-weathered friend\nI feel your sorrow and tears (They are mine)\nI share to the end\nIrresistible force meets an immovable object\nAnd human animal magic\nHow far can you go?\nThe rolling of thunder and\nYou decide what you're after\nI get to find my personal god\nI get to find my personal god\nI surrenderAll or nothing\nYou must spread your wings and fly\nI know the place and the time (of our lives)\nMy fair-weathered friend\nI feel your sorrow and tears (They are mine)\nWe share to the end\nWhen an irresistible force meets an immovable object\nHuman animal madness and blood starts to flow\nThere's bound to be heartbreak\nYou make it the hard way\nI surrenderAll or nothing\nYou must spread your wings and fly"
