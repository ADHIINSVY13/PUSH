  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'll pretend my heart's not on fire\nIf you steal my true love's name\nBroke-down subway in this city of spires\nTape your picture over his in the frame\nWe'll imagine we're sleeping revolvers\nShotgun wedding in a strange SoHo\nOur chambers hold silvery collars\nGun down werewolves wherever we go\nWe gun down werewolves wherever we go\n[Verse 2]\nMidnight phone calls in the back of a Mustang\nCreased white pages torn right from the spine\nKissed my neck with a crooked, cracked fang\nYou always hoped one day you'd be mine\nThrew our fathers on funeral pyres\nI'm not sure we were playing a game\nBusted gasket in a field full of liars\nNo one noticed we set five boroughs aflame\nNo one noticed we set five boroughs aflame\n[Chorus]\nYoung blood\nYoung bone\nOld ghosts\nGo home\n\n[Verse 3]\nBand of gold with a diamond implied\nYou wrote letters that you never sent\nI made promises I'll always deny\nNow we'll never know what the other meant\nWatch is ticking like a heartbeat gone berserk\nLost the chance to wind the key\nRoosters are nothing but clucking clockwork\nOur fears are only what we tell them to be\nOur fears are only what we tell them to be\n[Bridge]\nDrown the last of our matches\nBurn the rest of each other\nYou were strongest when I ached for breath\nThrough the thick of smoke, we'll finally smother\n[Chorus]\nYoung blood\nYoung bone\nOld ghosts\nGo home\n[x6]"
