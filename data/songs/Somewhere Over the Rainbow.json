  "lyrics": "Somewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high\nAnd the dreams that you've dreamed of\nOnce in a lullaby\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBluebirds fly\nAnd the dreams that you've dreamed of\nDreams really do come true\nSomeday I'll wish upon a star\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far\nBehind me\nWhere troubles melts like lemon drops\nHigh above the chimney tops\nThat's where you'll find me\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nBluebirds fly\nAnd the dreams that you dare to..\nOh why, oh why can't I?\nWell, I see\nTrees of green and red roses too\nI'll watch them bloom for me and you\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\nWell I see\nSkies of blues and, clouds of white\nAnd the brightness of day, I like the dark\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\nThe colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky\nAre also on the faces of people passing by\nI see friends shaking hands saying how do you do\nThey're really saying I ... I love you\nI hear babies cry, I watch them grow\nThey'll learn much more than really know\nAnd I think to myself\nWhat a wonderful world\nSomeday I'll wish upon a star\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far\nBehind me\nWhere troubles melt like lemon drops\nHigh above the chimney tops\nThat's where you'll find me\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high\nAnd the dreams that you dare to\nOh why, oh why can't I?"
