Do that shit again\nHow you got a manager you \nmad\n at after you got the win?\nBet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end\nBet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends\nGive 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then\nYou just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been\nThere when others should've been\nGot a nigga starin' at the game like, \"Damn, coach, put him in\"\nBut you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again\nGot us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been\nAnd I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in\nAnd it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend\nAnd it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge\nIt's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men\nIt's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends\nIt's because you niggas never learn when to say when\nYeah\n\n[Outro]\nFor real\nFacts, you know what I'm sayin'?\nHahaha, yeah"
