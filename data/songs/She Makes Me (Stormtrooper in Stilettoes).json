  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI love, she makes me\nShe is my heart\nShe is my love\nShe is my love\n[Verse 2]\nI know, I'm jealous of her\nShe makes me need\nShe is my love\nShe is my love\n[Bridge]\nWho knows who she'll make me\nAs I lie in her cocoon\nBut the world will surely heal my ills\nI'm warm and terrified\nShe makes me so\n[Verse 3]\nI know the day I leave her\nI'll love her still\nShe is my love\nShe is my love\n[Bridge]\nWho knows where my dreams will end\nI'll follow as they grow\nBut the world will know\nHow long I'll take\nAnd if I'm very slow\nShe makes me so\n\n[Outro]\nShe is my love\nShe is my love\n[Solo]\n[Ambulance siren]"
