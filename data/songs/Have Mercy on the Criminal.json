  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHave you heard the dogs at night\nSomewhere on the hill?\nChasing some poor criminal\nAnd I guess they're out to kill\nOh, there must be shackles on his feet\nAnd mother in his eyes\nStumbling through the devil-dark\nWith the hound pack in full cry\n[Chorus]\nHave mercy on the criminal\nWho is running from the law\nAre you blind to the winds of change?\nDon't you hear him any more?\nPraying, \"Lord, you gotta help me\nI am never gonna sin again\nJust take these chains from around my legs\nSweet Jesus, I'll be your friend\"\n[Verse 2]\nNow have you ever seen the white teeth gleam\nWhile you lie on a cold damp ground?\nYou're taking in the face of a rifle butt\nWhile the wardens hold you down\nAnd you've never seen a friend in years\nOh, it turns your heart to stone\nYou jump the walls and the dogs run free\nAnd the grave's gonna be your home\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, have mercy on the criminal\nWho is running from the law\nAre you blind to the winds of change?\nDon't you hear him any more?\nPraying, \"Lord, you gotta help me\nI am never gonna sin again\nJust take these chains from around my legs\nOoh, sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend\"\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Chorus]\nOh, have mercy on the criminal\nWho is running from the law\nAre you blind to the winds of change?\nDon't you hear him any more?\nPraying, \"Lord, you gotta help me\nI am never gonna sin again\nJust take these chains from around my legs\nSweet Jesus, I'll be your friend\""
