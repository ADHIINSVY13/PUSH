  "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah!\nYou see a nigga soft? My first instinct is to lean on him! (lean on him...)\nA weak nigga eatin' in my hood? Niggas'll put a beam on 'em! (beam on him...)\nThese niggas ain't s'pposed to be eatin', yo! They sweet as Sweet'N Low\nI'll have 'em like shit was all good just a week ago\n. (\"Lights oooooooon! \")\n[Verse 1]\nLet these fake niggas get you in the mood for love\nI'm back to get you in the mood for the Snub and gloves\nDope fiend, morphine, cocaine dilemma;\nCrack come to cookin' up that; boy, I'm a chemist!\nFuck pill poppin'; a strap, I pop that!\nWatch the Henchman trial, see a rat rat on a rat!\nYou got a nice gimmick goin', you've been hot a few summers\nBut I got the kinda flow that could stop World hunger\nSK, I got nothing but energy (energy!)\nCall me Fifty, call me \"Ferrari the Remedy\" (Remedy!)\n\"Hi\" again in case a hater don't remember me\nI happen to be what these rap niggas here pretend to be\nHittin' you won't be enough, you gotta finish me\nOr it's Ruger time, the SR-9\nFragments ricochet and ya ass go blind\nTimes up, ya fucked! Gotta learn to duck, whassup?\n[Hook]\nDon't make me, don't make me\nDon't make me... seem so complicated\nDon't make me, don't make me\nDon't make me\nShow you wassup, don't make me fuck you up!\n\n[Verse 2]\nListen, \nevery bitch on the milk box ain't missin'\nI mean some of these hoes runnin' round with pimpin'\nI'm writin' reality, it sounds harsh;\nShyne tried to get at me, he say I'm washed!\nI ain't even fire back, the shit's squashed\nWhat kind of shit is that? This only happens in rap\nThese niggas so fake, it make my skin crawl\nHope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall\nIce chunks in the chain, waves spinnin'\nCream linen, bulges from the Benjamin's in 'em!\nTom Ford? - Oh, Looord!\nIf I ain't know better, I'd think a nigga pushed raw\nIt feels like it's never gon' stop\nA nigga so hot, I may spend forever on top!\n\"Forever, ever\"? Forever in the drop\nYou can't tell I got it on lock? Bitch!\n[Hook]\nDon't make me, don't make me\nDon't make me... seem so complicated\nDon't make me, don't make me\nDon't make me\nShow you wassup, don't make me fuck you up!"
