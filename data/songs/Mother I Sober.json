Told you I was Christian, but just not today\nI transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape\nMy mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife\nStarin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night\nLoved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover\nTransformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober\n[Chorus: Beth Gibbons]\nI wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\nOoh, I wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted\nOnly child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas\nFamily ties, they accused my cousin, \"Did he touch you, Kendrick?\"\nNever lied, but no one believed me when I said \"He didn't\"\nFrozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself\nI started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself\nTalked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself\nHe has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help\nCongratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy\nWater watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me\nSpirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me\n\"Did he touch you?\" I said \"No\" again, still they didn't believe me\nMother's brother said he got revenge for my motherâ€™s face\nBlack and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase\n'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over\nBlame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober\n\n[Chorus: Beth Gibbons]\nI wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\nOoh, I wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nI was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind\nI need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined\nI did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions\nNo dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer\nIntoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women\nWhitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin' God, \"Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?\"\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, \"Is there an addiction?\"\nI said \"No,\" but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy\nI asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her \"No\"\nI never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic\nTold me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection\nThough it never happened, she wouldn't agree\nNow I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced\nAmplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous\nI was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years\nNothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel\nI made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood\nBut Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could\nAll those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked\nI pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract\nA conversation not bein' addressed in Black families\nThe devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity\nThey raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters\nThen they made us watch, then made us rape each other\nPsychotic torture between our lives, we ain't recovered\nStill livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance\nEvery other brother has been compromised\nI know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused\nI see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos\nSo listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move\nLearn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school\nHis anger grows deep in misogyny\nThis is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active\nSo I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made\nSo I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame\nSo I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain\nI hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain\nSo I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all\nSo I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God\nSo I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred\nAs I set free all you abusers, this is transformation\n\n[Chorus: Beth Gibbons]\nI wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\nOoh, I wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\n[Interlude: Whitney Alford]\nYou did it, I'm proud of you\nYou broke a generational curse\nSay \"Thank you, dad\"\nThank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother\nMr. Morale\n[Outro: Sam Dew]\nBefore I go in fast asleep, love me for me\nI bare my soul and now we're free"
