  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nLook at all the choices, the choices in this world\nWorld spreading no freedom, freedom for the boys and the girls\nBut the boys and the girls they don’t know, what love is like\nLove is like appreciation mixed in a double cup of Sprite\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo can we go?\nNo left or right\nYou go your way\nAnd I'll go mine\n[Chorus x2]\nCause this is my time\nAnd I won’t waste it\nThinking 'bout what you gotta say\nCause I'm here to stay\n[Verse 2]\nLook at all the places, places that I've been\nIt doesn't come easy, you gotta have strength\nAnd when it goes down and it’s all said and done\nYou gotta stand up so there’s no need to run\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd now that I've made it\nI won’t look back no\nSacrifice what meant the most to me\nThe most to me, yes I did\n\n[Chorus x2]\n[Outro]\nLook at all the people standing outside\nSo dedicated\nYour love doesn't go unrecognised\nYour love doesn't go unrecognised"
