Bang! Bang!\nAin't no time!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nAin't no time!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSweet as torture, at least we were alive\nCringe and burns, but mark my words, so\n[Chorus]\nSave your breath, save your breath\nSave your breath, 'cause it's mine\nSave your breath, save your breath\nSave your breath, 'cause it's mine\nNice!\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Bridge]\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nAin't no time!\nBang! Bang! Bang!\nAin't no time!\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSweet as torture, now mark my words and\n[Chorus]\nSave your breath, save your breath\nSave your breath, 'cause it's mine\nSave your breath, save your breath\nSave your breath, 'cause it's mine\nSave your breath, save your breath\nSave your breath, 'cause it's mine\nNice!"
